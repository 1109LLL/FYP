400444,Royal Passeig de Gracia, preserving your modesty in the room is hard as the bathroom doors are glass and the external door to enter is a sliding door that runs flush with a glass partition So if your treating the Gf or a wife make sure you take the browns to the super bowl somewhere before you get up to your room just a thought dude save , staff were great and the rooftop bar a real treat

400452,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The room is noisy and was full of the remains partucularly the smell of cleaining liquid like if someone would have poured 2 litre of liquid on the carpet I never have a headache but there I had Also the balcony should be cleaned up sometimes , Location and staff

400458,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, I d booked this hotel for 4 nights the Deluxe Double Room with Terrace for 3 nights and Superior Twin Room for last night as at the time of booking the Deluxe Double Room was only available for 3 nights But during my stay the hotel let me keep my room for the last night and for me that was great 
400459,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The staff was friendly but there was no room service at 23 30 pm and all I asked for was hot water because the kettle was broken Also the night before I left the hotel I asked the reception to organize a taxi at a specific time in the morning to take me to the airport but when I was ready to leave the taxi wasn t there the staff was changed due to shift and they were not aware of the situation which was very disappointing , The hotel was located on a very famous street which was great The room was clean and the breakfast was okay

400464,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Kitchen can be better Nothing much to eat for a tired and exhsusted traveller , Location was unbeatable next to Casa Mila Many cafes nearby Not as busy as Las Rambla Breakfast was good croissants fresh Room spacious and beds comfortable Nice view on terrace but food so so Staff most helpful and command of English very good 
400465,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The working hours of the open restaurant on the roof the lobby is quite tiny so if you want to hava a coffee without leaving the hotel it is problematic The breakfast is not very reach so after staying more then 2 days it gets quite boring , The location is extraordinary walking distances to just about all of the major attractions in the center area The staff was very kind and quite helpful The open roof with a restaurant is a unique experience as well as the room view if you go for the street side 
400466,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, Friendly helpful staff great rooftop bar Enjoy your breakfast on the terrace Then step outside the hotel for some of the best architecture you will see in any city oh and the shopping 
400467,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Relatively small space in the room You cannot open the window in the room And the air condition was not working really well which is a bit problem then with humidity and smell Plus there is no hanger in the bathroom for towels which was a bit strange My other recommendation would go to staff If we are considering this is a 4 star hotel I would maybe expect more advice or help for tourists As most of the attractions in Barcelona are limited for capacity and already booked I would give in advance that information to clients that they should book online for attractions or ideally the hotel could do that for themselves , Location is definitely the best asset of this Hotel plus nice breakfast
400468,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The people working on the terrace bar are pretty slow preparing beverages so you need to be patient awaiting your order especially when you can see quite a lot of people up there We were forced to cancel our order after 40 minutes waiting as we had another appointment planned after , The location of the hotel is just perfect 150m to Diagonal Metro station Rambla is just 300 m away So for our family tour with some sightseeing and enjoying good restaurants this was a perfect choice The hotel is very comfortable and quiet You can have rest on the terrace bar with a breathtaking view of Barcelona especially illuminated Sagrada Familia in the night 
400469,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The breakfast was just above par There was a shortage of fresh fruit and the bread was not always there The staff would fetch it real quick but I think it should be there without asking in this kind of hotel , Hotel was good Bathroom was good to Shower is not high enough I am almost 2 meters but even for a person of 1 8 m it was low The room was OK and had al the proper things It was clean it was nice The location is superb

400474,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The front desk staff were not very friendly or helpful and seemed annoyed whenever we asked a question , The location was perfect There were two popular Gaudi museums within a few blocks and two more Gaudi attractions within a few miles We walked almost everywhere Very safe and beautiful area We would definitely stay there again 
400475,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Our Welcome was not very welcoming we were not given any info on the hotel or the facilities The room was very basic bar menu price list was not provided Empty bottles weren t removed from the room One of the bulbs in the bathroom wasn t working No room service Hotel did not respond to enquiry regarding late check out and food intolerance Location was perfect but the hotel was one of the least satisfying I ve stayed in at this price range We won t rebook We will definitely come back to Barcelona ,No Positive

400478,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Water pressure in the shower is too low especially when using the rain shower , Location and location Close to metro close to shops and Catalunya Very safe and well lid area to stay at Staff are friendly and helpful Rooms and overall facilities
400479,Royal Passeig de Gracia, the room was pretty small and we had a premium double would be better if the rooms had balcony s as me and my partner were smokers so had to keep going outside the front as the rooftop bar did not open until 5pm which gave you a sense of feeling trapped in your room not that we spent much time in it , the staff were really helpful and friendly and made sure we had a hassle free check in and check out and our stay during our Holiday we also was offered two free drinks on the rooftop as a thank you for staying 
400480,Royal Passeig de Gracia, lobby too small and crowded rooms OK some of the rooms without a window to open to the outside rooftop balcony nice overall good location but facilities and rooms are less than expected according to the price charged , Great Location and great staff rooms are Ok 
400481,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Ratings are too high for this hotel Beds were uncomfortable for this level of hotel Terrace Bar should not allow smoking as it is a fairly enclosed space for those of us who don t smoke it is quite unenjoyable to breathe the smoke Though our room was on a top floor the view was almost nothing due to hotel placards on windows maybe a lower quality room for booking com customers , Breakfast has numerous selections of fruits breads meats Location is very good

400489,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Where to start 1 It was disgusting that we were supplied with ONE 500mm bottle of water over our 3 night stay in a premier room 2 It was very bad that the only bar available was the roof terrace that opened at 5 30 3 The breakfast was appalling All hot food was cold and the eggs were also dry Almost like dry powder We had paid a total of 120 for rubbish As seasoned travellers we are away from home 6 months a year and always stay in 5 accommodation we found the hotel very poor in quality and certainly not value for money ,No Positive

400497,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Mixer tap over bath was broken but housekeeping sorted although this was after my wife had to go to another room for a bath This would not prevent us from booking this property again however , Location and friendliness and efficiency of the staff
400498,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Service at terrace bar was really slow they didn t refill our minibar until a few hours before we left breakfast was overpriced and they made us leave at 10 30 as they closed at that time without letting us finish breakfast, The bed and room was very comfortable The hotel is located very near La Predera and Casa Battl The restaurants near hotel are very touristy but you can find some less touristy ones a few streets over

400509,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Breakfast needs a supervisor to organise as too hectic on a Sunday morning especially with the mixed cliental, Friendly excellent pair of young ladies at reception that should receive special merit

400523,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, Although we checked in late abt 7pm and stayed for 5 night but was disappointed when we asked the staff for some allowance to have a late check out till 2 pm they only gave till 12 30 saying the rooms were fulled but was willing to allow unless we paid for one more day Which i found was a bitter for me 
400524,Royal Passeig de Gracia, a bit dark in hallways lot of noise in back of building at night kind of a sound tunnel amplifying noise from outside and other rooms had to keep windows closed though lovely nights with pleasant temperatures outside, very nice location at upper less busy end of street good assortment of breakfast foods great coffee generous with amenities such as toiletries adaptors printers helpful staff
400525,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, Excellent location Perfect even for a business trip Restaurants and other interesting places in walking distance Very comfy rooms and pleasant staff Breakfast variety could improve but yet it was delicious 
400526,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Complimentary drinks token allocated at reception Nice gesture however having paid 650 I expected them to be valid for more than a small beer or a glass of coke Not really welcoming , Excellent staff with fantastic support with all aspects of our stay Choice of food at the buffet breakfast was more than adequate with the staff constantly refreshing the platter and incredibly helpful when required 
400527,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Personel could have tackled the problems quicker it is pretty annoying when you have to chase and remind them to fix things that were supposed to be working , The location is amazing not far away from all touristic spots The room is cozy but we got the one with a very small window so not enough light Another poibt was thta TV was not working and it took them forever to fix but at the end of the day we came there not to watch TV so not a big problem

400529,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Security was not good We checked in around 11 30 pm While waiting in the lobby a man came through the rear back door of the lobby and grabbed my small Louie V bag and started for the door I Ran after him grabbed him by the the shirt and he dropped my bag thank goodness You need to have a security person in the lobby at night , The rooms were very nice Not enough closet space for hanging garments The bathroom was large with all kinds of toilets 
400530,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Nothing, Excellent breakfast with a wide selection of hot and cold food including fruit cereal breads pastries ham cheese and a full cooked breakfast Reception staff have an excellent command of English and the bedrooms are comfortable and well maintained 
400531,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, The wifi was appallingly slow in the room and non existent on the roof top bar The bathroom in our Superior room was tiny and very poorly designed with few toiletries one shampoo that doubled as shower gel no conditioner no bathrobes and the basin was in the corridor outside the bathroom so no possibility of any privacy and no space around it for two people s toiletries the shower was in the same tiny space as the loo so we swapped rooms with my daughter whose Standard room had a better bathroom but was a smaller size with a smaller bed For two people sharing the Superior room the bathroom is a joke not a funny one Breakfast was chaotic with the main coffee machine broken throughout our four night stay A tiny kettle provided to boil water for tea but it was the slowest you could ever imagine and also tiny so one was constantly looking for staff to ask for more water Not enough teapots ever large cups ran out no plain yoghurt on two days the most popular so there were always spare fruit ones that no one seemed to want choice of food was good though some cakes and pastries tasted of chemicals and were clearly not home made Very dry and tasteless Red Velvet cake Check out was problematic Summary brilliant location clean hotel nice staff but terrible bathrooms and chaos at breakfast Needs a shake up in management at breakfast which incidentally was NOT included in the price and charges hefty 9 Euros per person if booked for the duration of your stay at check in otherwise I think it was 15 Euros per person and a rethink about everything to do with the bathrooms which were just dismal 
400532,Royal Passeig de Gracia, When checking in wasn t even acknowledged until finished with previous customer Service very slow in rooftop terrace, Location and view from rooftop terrace
400533,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Some breakfast items were a little cold but the selection was varied and well presented and of high quality, The room and facilities were great the view of the city from the balcony fabulous Staff were friendly abd welcoming they were super efficient and I d definitely rebook this hotel on my next stay in Barcelona
400534,Royal Passeig de Gracia, No coffee in room , Fresh lovely modern roomy boutique hotel right in the heart of Barca s Modernist district The rooftop terrace lounge is an impressive 360 perk 
400535,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, Amazingly friendly staff was here on my honeymoon and they upgraded us to a nicer room free of charge The hotel is in a perfect location right in the middle of some great shopping and centrally located The room itself was modern with a balcony and amazing views The bed was large and comfortable as was the spacious shower Loved this hotel For the price you really get an amazing location and comfortable spacious room 
400536,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Whenever I had a question The staff seemed to make up answers as things went along , Location location location If you have any questions ask before you except the keys to your room
400537,Royal Passeig de Gracia, There was no room service I travel with my 3 years old boy at 9 30 there was no room service for food Break fast area was too small and crowdy break fast was not good enough elevators was too old there was no lobby at all I ask the concierge to post a small box for me and they didn t In my mind that was a mistake , just the location
400538,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Breakfast was not good Service was not good The staff weren t happy to help and made us feel bad for asking for things They charged my card even after i checked out and left spain I did NOT sign for the additional charge and was NOT informed about it either , The location was good 
400539,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Price relatively high Housekeeping service only until 11pm which cause a bit inconvenient, Location near metro station and easy access to main attractions Room is clean and spacious enough 
400540,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The shower issue, The food upstairs and down wad great My only issue is the leaking shower it should be fixed before someone slips also because of this issue the rain shower is redundant
400541,Royal Passeig de Gracia, sound proofing is a bit bad doors of rooms way too heavy and don t close slowly when not guided to close they sound like they are being slammed can be heard even from several doors down need to install heavy duty closers so the doors are shut slowly and silently or install bottom of door sweepers to insulate sound from the hallway just do something , Location is perfect staff were always courteous and consistent and breakfast selection was quite good
400542,Royal Passeig de Gracia, No face clothes in the room to wash your face I guess Europeans don t use face clothes The room is ok but the shower and bath is not well designed Whenever I take a shower the water splash outside because the floor is the same level as the bathroom floor Maid is not very friendly or helpful at all Breakfast is ok did not provide fresh omelet Overall it is a nice hotel but pricey , Check in service is prompt and the porters were very helpful The bath rain shower is nice The room is very quiet 
400543,Royal Passeig de Gracia, I would say that the beds are short feet over the edge isn t ideal Also would appreciate water every day for a 4 hotel , The hotel was lovely in a fabulous position and the roof terrace was great with gorgeous views 
400544,Royal Passeig de Gracia, There were a few delays and slightly faulty service in the room cleaning in one or two days in our one week stay , Great location very comfortable room friendly staff excellent breakfast and the rooftop bar is a must 
400545,Royal Passeig de Gracia, I would have liked to have had a bath tub in our bathroom Incredibly the shops were closed on both Saturday and Sunday because of a festival, The hotel was situated in a very good position for shopping when they were open and restaurants The staff were very friendly and helpful
400546,Royal Passeig de Gracia, While leaving the staff member by available wasn t too helpful and didn t help with the luggage, Location right next to casa Batllo quality of room rooftop bar and the breakfast 
400547,Royal Passeig de Gracia, A disappointing experience some of the staff at the reception and the terrace were unfriendly and rude sleeping at the room made me feel like I m sleeping in the corridor I could hear everything slamming doors people chatting or even when the housekeeping are cleaning the rooms The reception area is so small and crowded most of the time , Location 
400548,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The reception area is long and narrow gets quite crowded and not enough seats The faucet and controls for the tub in our room was behind the immovable glass portion of the shower door If you have to give your kid a bath this will require some slippery acrobatics at the end of your tiring day , Rooftop Wjat a great place to unwind after a long day of sightseeing The staff were very friendly and accomodated my curious 5 year old They made us feel welcome and the 50 pound gin cocktail is a must 
400549,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, The hotel is in a great location Right by some of the Gaudi buildings The staff were all very nice and helpful The rooftop terrace is a beautiful place to relax and have a drink and something to eat 
400550,Royal Passeig de Gracia, AC was not working properly and it was not fixed although we have notified hotel staff several times Bad smell from the bath sink House keeping is very bad as they do not replace bathrobes new water bottles and do not clean the bathroom floor, Location and Staff good attitude
400551,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Don t get me wrong with my comments I have stayed at this Hotel twice and the venue and location are very good and and most definitely will book there on future stays in Bcn Staff are very friendly and professional however the check out surprisingly was a bit chaotic due to people leaving and coming also this was maybe a one off but from 11 am the corridors were very noisy with the cleaning staff singing and talking Obviously I am not saying that people should not be singing wiles working but perhaps a bit less louder Saying all this and despite the above I will definitely stay there again and I recommend to those who wish to go BNC to stay there The little things I mentioned I believe were a one off , The hotel has a nice roof terrace and the cocktails a pretty amazing Staff are very professional and friendly Is the perfect spot to start the day with a strawberry mojito
400552,Royal Passeig de Gracia, We could have been offered maps on arrival as we noticed other people had been given some , Rooms were clean comfortable and spacious air conditioned but not noisy and is the first hotel I have stayed in where the room temperature was spot on Quiet for a central location too Arnold who met us on arrival was very welcoming and helpful The highlight is the rooftop bar We didn t eat at the hotel so cannot comment on that 
400553,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Spotty connectivity one call button controls one elevator and another call button controls the other two elevators , Staff comfort terrace over looking the city 
400554,Royal Passeig de Gracia, May be can improve hotel wifi , Our room very clean and comfort yummy breakfast good location rooftop bar was nice will come again next time 
400555,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The room had a small window and it didn t get enough light so even in the morning you felt like it s night, The location was great and the staff was super friendly and helpful
400556,Royal Passeig de Gracia, better pillows and instructions for the coffee machine, arrived earlier than booking in time and taken to the lovely roof top bar and given a free drink each until our rooms were ready Staff were really pleasant and the location was fab
400557,Royal Passeig de Gracia, It was noisy internally at night from the other guests Lifts were slow , Amazing location and easy to get to anywhere A very efficient taxi service A great choice for breakfast everything you could want Very easy parking on site Welcoming desk staff Top bar is very special with great views of the city 
400558,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The only bad thing what I didn t like was the fact that we only had 2 nights here before the flight Everything else was amazingly perfect , Everything was just perfect from the moment of checking in to the moment we checked out and everything in between The Staff is amazing the rooms are AMAZING The Breakfast Food is Amazin Just give it a try trust me its amazing In just a few words a must stay at least one night best hotel I ve stayed in period

400561,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Wanted to extend but staff told higher 50 higher than booking com but when we told them we want same room as don t want to pack our luggage they told can t be possible so decided to move out to another hotel I think staff should know what to answer to the guest on the right time , It s a clean hotel
400562,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The low level light that switched on when you put your feet out of the bed , Loved the roof terrace spectacular views absolutely spectacular Rooms were super comfy and very spacious with beautiful bathrooms And the staff were so helpful friendly kind and attentive 
400563,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The door to the balcony was broken and was not able to close it I didn t like the front desk trying to sell me an upgrade to a balcony room for 60 more and actually my room has a balcony Staff didn t explain clearly that the discount breakfast buffet only applies if we buy our breakfast buffet two days consecutively My opinion is BS they are just trying to make more money out of us The worse thing is their breakfast buffet The food was terrible for a 20 00 euro buffet breakfast The bacon the sausages were aweful I am not picky about food and to me spitting out food is sinful I had to spit out a bite of the cheesecake It was so old it crumbled and watery I feel like the hotel is trying to make as much money as possible from the tourist It was not a cheap room I paid over 300 euro per night By the way the main entrance does not look grand , I like the location I like the room decor 
400564,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Breakfast is too expensive Especially as lots of cafe serving good cheaper breakfast, Perfectly placed for sight seeing Knowledgeable friendly staff Very clean 
400565,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The view from our Garden View room window was almost totally blocked by a structural design of the building s exterior I wish we ve had chosen a street view for our stay to view the beautiful boulevard in that area , This hotel is steps away from the metro and hop on hop off bus tour Our room was large enough to accommodate our family of 4 The bathroom was spacious and very clean I wished they would re locate the safe in a lower part of the closet The breakfast was fun to eat outside at the garden and I personally loved their donuts Cheers
400566,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The staff especially the main lobby receptionist had a bad attitude with her guests and other staff members she was bickering towards the maintenance guy in front of us about a stapler One other night we requested an additional bed and Jordi who was working that night gave no solution and with a bad attitude responded that he could not do anything about it that we should have called earlier , The terrace was great but they close too early and do not warn that the kitchen closes earlier than the bar 
400567,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, The room was very spacious and comfortable The breakfast was great Amazing location Very friendly staff Would definetly stay here at my next trip to Barcelona They also upgraded our room with no added fee

400571,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Manger of the hotel she is not professional at all she don t want to extend my room and she call the police This is how she treat the customers she charge me same room with double price make sure leave the hotel on date O W they call police I surprised this hapned first time in my life , Good location
400572,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Breakfast was limited but im greedy anyway The water in the mini bar was ridiculously expensive even by mini bar standards Wifi was rubbish but tbh it seemed to be rubbish everywhere in Barcelona so maybe its not their fault , Nice friendly staff great roof top bar with panoramic views over the city and quite possibly the most comfortable bed i ve ever slept in Great location with a Metro stop only a short walk away 
400573,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Style over substance the windows were twisted pieces of metal rather than glass so that was a crazy architectural idea since windows are designed to be looked through Also the breakfast room again concrete blocks in an inverted V shape beautiful to look at but anyone over 5 feet 5 would crack their heads We walked into our mirror quite a few times as the door was opposite to it and it was an optical illusion, The proximity and location were excellent as was the rooftop bar and Felix expert bartender
400574,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The hotel is at the end of Passeig De Gracia The cleaning of the rooms is very bad within the few days of our stay the house keeping pretend to do the cleaning In addition that we have stolen items from our shopping which every one deny and say impossible while other guests complained as well from missing items as well from their rooms ,No Positive
400575,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The bar 833 on the terrace has TERRIBLE service Do NOT go there Very rude staff and they take forever to serve you and they aren t friendly I would just eat from the mini bar in the room if you have too , Loved the staff the location and the rooms Great hotel and very clean I will definitely be coming back in the near future 
400576,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Bed could have been more comfortable could feel the springs wiring through the mattress , Great breakfast and lovely friendly staff Breakfast terrace was great and view from rooftop bar was spectacular great cocktails too 
400577,Royal Passeig de Gracia, However I had slight problem with TV It was not working and I called for fix but I found no answer , Everything was cool there especially the location of the hotel 
400578,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Beds were hard as a rock I had to sleep on top of pillows after the first night Breakfast area was nice with outdoor and indoor tables but the food selection was a bit boring after the second day , Staff were very pleasant location is excellent for shopping and a metro station is very close Roof top bar is fantastic for chilling out after a day of sightseeing 
400579,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The entrance was small and a bit awkward , Great location and clean comfortable rooms The staff was very friendly unlike many other hotels and restaurant in Eueope the 83 3 terrace was amazing with great and very friendly staff 
400580,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Not enough facilities no gym foyer is tiny which limits how quickly they can process guests Bottle neck during checkout Very slow lift , Great location great shower clean

400582,Royal Passeig de Gracia, No gym one lift was broken, Staff excellent room excellent great views rooftop bar amazing very relaxing place and right in the luxury shops district above Prada 
400583,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Cleaning of room tended to be late afternoon when we came back from a day out and wanted to chill in room although not a big issue and not all people probably had this issue as it was probably the time of day they serviced our floor Couldn t get internet working on tv as booklet was vague Only English news channels on tv would have been nice to have an English speaking light entertainment channel , Hotel was very central to the city in walking distance from most attractions and in a nice area Liked the blackout blinds air conditioning staff were very friendly and easy to understand enjoyed the roof top terrace bar Room was very comfortable with fridge bar and safe 
400584,Royal Passeig de Gracia, No bell desk service early morning when we were checking out Reception took forever to check us in Waiter at the roof top bar ignored our request to place an order for a good 15 minutes Overall although the infrastructure and location was good the service needed significant improvement , Excellent location
400585,Royal Passeig de Gracia, One of the elevators was not working and the other had an issue with the button Hence 1 out of 3 elevators were functioning Which was a pain , Nice hotel modern clean nice staff Cool rooftop lounge
400586,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, Very cute hotel in fabulous location The rooftop bar is delightful with fantastic views of Barcelona The breakfast was wonderful full of good Spanish delights much nicer than many hotels Merci aussi Rosand et her colleagues they even gave us a glass of cava on our last night there We kept extending our stay because it was so pleasant and in such a great neighborhood Merci 
400587,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Room had sacrificed practability for style No full length mirror no hooks for coats by door poor lighting for doing makeup getting in and out of shower positively dangerous , Reception staff excellent

400589,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Very disappointed to have booked a double room through Booking com and be told we could only have a twin room on arrival That took a lot away from what should have been an amazing night in a great hotel , The hotel completely met expectations Facilities were great 
400590,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The breakfast bar was very simple and not worth the 18euros Also for the price and level of the hotel we would have expected there to be the euro football showing on one of the TV channels This is a big No No during the euro cup, The hotel was very central and the rooms were to good size
400591,Royal Passeig de Gracia, There were several steps inside the room which led to door and bathroom Needed to be careful , Good location with upscale stores Gucci etc Full breakfast buffet 
400592,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Beware the mini bar Prices even steeper than usual e g bottle of water was 12, Location was excellent The rooftop terrace is great for a relaxing cocktail and room was comfortable and spacious for price band Good selection at breakfast Staff all friendly and knowledgeable 
400593,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Room a little expensive Bed stiffness, Great breakfast which was 9 euro per person when we purchased day of checking in Good location on Passeig de Gracia main street in barcelona with shopping and attractions 4 blocks from Casa Battlo and less 1 block from La Pedrera Staff very friendly but a little expensive Bed was a stiff but room had nice waterfall shower 
400594,Royal Passeig de Gracia, lighting in the hallways really dark, loved my room 408 comfortable very very staff really accommodating Bartender on roof top excellent italian fellow
400595,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Internet connection was poor no tissues provided and ventilation could be better, Rooftop bar and the cocktails were excellent The staff are friendly and helpful
400596,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Reception people at the hotel were rude and HORRIBLE attitude Offensive not helpful and really did not make up feel welcome Also the food at the hotel bar we were served had mold in it After hours of traveling to Barca to eat moldy food it s offensive , Location was great
400597,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Not surprisingly the rooftop terrace is very popular but at busy times it can be quite smoky We found it to be nicer in the late afternoon early evening Service can also be a bit slow An iron ironing board in the room would have been good But these are fairly minor things , Excellent location we were able to walk to a lot of the sights Very clean and comfortable hotel and an excellent view from the rooftop terrace 
400598,Royal Passeig de Gracia, It felt slightly dated, The wifi was fast and connected whenever we were in the hotel always important haha Staff all spoke fluent English and were very nice and helpful Each got a free drink to use on their roof bar which was great Beds were comfortable
400599,Royal Passeig de Gracia, There was a step in the room which was potentially dangerous between the bathroom and the sleeping area There were no hooks in the shower area for hanging towels , The view was fantastic and the service was great 
400600,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Family was put in adjoining rooms and one room had sewer gas smell Staff tried to deodorize room but didn t work We found a solution but not ideal Management discounted our stay Orders on terrace sometimes not followed up on so remind as needed , Staff helpful and accommodating Nice location Rooms clean Terrace is a great place to hang out and go over all the photos taken during the day and have a drink 
400601,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, What a fabulous spotlessly clean and modern small hotel in the best location of Barcelona I will definately be staying here again when next I visit Barcelona Our room was bright modern and spotlessly clean comfortable bed large bathroom seperate toilet and room had view of the Passeig de Gracia The rooftop Terrace bar with great views is fantastic The staff from the front desk to the bars were all very bright cheerful and so eager to please Nothing was too much trouble Service with a real smile Especial mention of the unbelievable service we received from Julia and Isabella at the front desk along with Felix and Rafael Wonderful stay especially after such a bad experience earlier with an Airbnb booking that went wrong 
400602,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Price was very high and i really thought to pay so much that breakfast was included shower the water came over and nearly was going into carpet water didnt run where it should SHOULD NOT HAPPEND Tv so couldnt switch off and middle of the night had to go Down asking for help Breakfast so not was included in that price and when charged we decide to eat out to a much better price coming out of lift and walk towards room really dark and sick feeling got Dizzy didnt like it at all , Location was Fantastic service from People working at the hotel was wonderful and helpful With everything we asked for thank you very much Gracie Bed was wonderful to sleep and relax in Radio channels on tv so played great Music yes Nice to put tv off and only listen to sound of Music shower bathroom very smart and clever and really liked it Space to put clothes etc etc very good safe so was fantastic and easy not all hotel have it or is easy to use but this was Perfect 
400603,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Some rooms dont have a window or a balcony so you feel there isnt fresh air and it is as if your sitting in a closed box, The location of the hotel is great
400604,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, Very good buffet breakfast with wide choice of different meals very friendly and helpful staff great location with superb views comfortable and spacy parking facilities excellent place for stay in Barcelona

400607,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, Great position A 50m walk to the metro The roof top terrace was wonderful at night All the staff were extremely helpful A great place to stay for a base to look around the beautiful city of Barcelona Would definitely come back again 
400608,Royal Passeig de Gracia, As a new hotel they are trying to attract more customers by giving quite competitive rates however the capacity to absorb these customers is questionable First night we stayed in a room with very noisy AC After second night I realised we were given actually a different smaller room from what we booked Staff was generally nice and helpful except one supervisor at reception who to my opinion was demotivating to her more junior colleagues and absolutely not helpful friendly to guests to say the least , Quite new hotel Pretty fair value for money well positioned and generally friendly staff Nice view from the roof bar 
400609,Royal Passeig de Gracia, the only negative thing is not opening windows in the rooms, I traveled to Barcelona with my friends and we stayed at this amazing hotel All the facilities staff the suit were absolutely brilliant Staff at the reception helped a lot with printing our tickets and suggestions on how to get to the destinations we needed The location of the hotel is the best ever Gracias and we hope to be back as soon as possible 
400610,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Breakfast wasn t satisfying Foods weren t fresh plus they don t have so many food options I didn t find the staff so professional , The hotel 5 mins walk to Gauidi s house Rooms are nice and clean 
400611,Royal Passeig de Gracia, We made it up to the roof terrace every evening before heading out for dinner however there was one member of staff that was really not very attentive and on two occasions we had to wait almost 45 minutes for just some drinks , The hotel was amazing The location the room the shower and the breakfast We enjoyed every moment of our trip The room cleaning was so through which made it exciting to come back too after a day out we also really enjoyed the cocktails on the roof terrace All in all would totally recommend 
400612,Royal Passeig de Gracia, everything was nice expect the receptionists My parents needed to change to a different room because I left after two nights staying with them The receptionist told me I can upgrade their room for 20 more per night with breakfast Then when I helped my parents check in to the new room the next day another receptionist who did the check in told me that the upgrade is free but breakfast was not included Finally when my parents checked out the third receptionist told them it was still 20 more per night with breakfast I mean seriously you guys were nice but this is just too messed up ,No Positive
400613,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The room was so perfumed that one of us got allergy problems Please tell as info that you use so much perfume , The staff was exceptionel helpfull and serviceminded The staff helped open a window so we could breathe At breakfirst same serviceminden personel thanks 
400614,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Our room was on the first floor and we could hear running water I have stayed here on at least six occasions so maybe I was unlucky, The location is very good
400615,Royal Passeig de Gracia, No inclusion for Arab food very poor and English is not really a major language Rooms need to be a little bigger , The overall environment is comfortable with excellent staff and service

400617,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Wifi darkly lite corridors, Wifi not great terrace bar female barterser not great good location front desk staff and rosana at breakfast was terrific
400618,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The only minor negative was that the rooftop terrace was filled with smoke since smoking is permitted so we could not enoy a cocktail there , Everything was great The staff was very friendly and helpful the room was well appointed and very comfortable The rain forest shower was the best We never saw such a huge selection of breakfast fare The hotel is on a beautiful boulevard of Fifth Avenue shops and accessible to metros buses or walking to other areas of the city 
400619,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Nothing , We had an upgraded Terrace Room and it was so delightful Bathroom was amazing Also Rosana in the Terrace Lounge was great The cocktails were delicious We will be back there next April 
400620,Royal Passeig de Gracia, We were accommodated in a room with double glazed facade and we could see everything the other couple was doing in their room and it was disgusting We had to cover our window with a sheet in order not to be seen The room didnt have a bathrobe and also no sleepers i would say it is less than a 3 star hotel not a 4 star imagine we paid 290 euro for 1night disappointing, Location was excellent also the picnic breakfast they prepared for us 
400621,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Nothing they can control Lovely roof top lounge was often cold with very noisy patrons , Excellent location pleasant and accommodating staff Excellent breakfast 
400622,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Service couldnt be bothered to accomodate a usb cable request No view at all View on the other wall Disappointed for this price They must have given the low quality room to booking users ,No Positive
400623,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The only thing I didn t like was the lack of Windows on the corridors and hallways That s all , The rooms are great and the terrace is absolutely fantastic The bartender from the terrace does some amazing cocktails best gin cocktails in Barcelona 
400624,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The shower s drainage was blocking easily It would be good to be able to open a window in the room to make the air flow across The Internet via WiFi is not so fast for a city as Barcelona doing basic actions not streaming was taking long time Difficult to go out to the yard in breakfast room with your hands busy door needs to turn the handle all the time Please put hooks to hang the raincoats inside the room next to the door Hangers inside the closet could be the normal ones no need to put those anti theft, The friendliness and amiability of your staff is really great Breakfast content and taste
400625,Royal Passeig de Gracia, 1 why no tissue box in bathroom 2 Small face towels would be appreciated 3 lighting along corridors abit too dark Give wrong impression of type of hotel , Long pillows Room layout esp bathroom
400626,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The room service should be 24 7 which it was the main issue we face in your hotel I hope you can find way to solve it Wish you the best , The reception stuff were so nice and helpful 
400627,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The noise factor I asked for a quiet room but was up till early hours of the morning not being able to sleep For 18 the breakfast is pathetic And the breakfast staff are not on the ball sometimes there were no knives and forks nor spoons once they got used up and tables were not cleared quickly enough on some of the days , The location
400628,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Very slow service check in more than 40 minutes Check out 20min Needs to improve this , Perfect location close to Ls Pedrera and Metro station Roof bar with wonderful view 
400629,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, Great location and the staff was very helpful Loved the terrace tapas bar Room was comfortable except lights were difficult to figure out Toilet area was claustrophobic Still a good experience just not great 
400630,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Unfortunately the people in the room next door had fallen asleep with the tv on which kept us awake as we could hear it as it was so loud but the blackout blind and comfort of the bed soon had is drifting off , I came to the hotel as it was recommended by someone who lives in Barcelona It s central with great access to the metro stations I was with my 9 year old son as we were over to watch the Barcelona game for his birthday Staff were so helpful and really tried to give me and my son the best advise to enjoy our stay from a great hotdog restaurant for a quick bite before the game to advise on metro lines and the most economical ticket to buy Couldn t have been more helpful and I would definitely stay here again Xx
400631,Royal Passeig de Gracia, In room 202 the air conditioning didn t work In room 214 the shower didn t stay at a constant temperature so went from very hot to very cold , The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly Location was perfect
400632,Royal Passeig de Gracia, We got a room with no door to the toilet and we are 2 friends traveling together They moved as after awful night to another room with the worst shower ever water was either ice or hell nothing in the middle , Nothing to write home about this is the worst vualue for money ever

400634,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The terrace opened only at 1pm No gym fitness center The room was a bit small and there wasn t enough space to store our clothes tiny wardrobes , Location is fantastic Amazing breakfast variety of freshly made pastries healthy corner Room was comfortable and new Fast wi fi also you can pay 6 per day to have a wi fi access all around Barcelona 
400635,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Oxygen in the hallway seemed to be a little low in comparison to our room and other areas Ventilation in the hallways getting off elevators could have been better , British accent Spanish lady was so nice to us She explained how to get everywhere and knew her stuff 
400636,Royal Passeig de Gracia, If I absolutely have to complain then it would probably be the size of the room which was very small Had a huge balcony but still no walking space in the room No housekeeping in the evening and it is done only once a day , Location is the best In the most posh location of town and walking distance to everything The staff at front desk are very helpful and polite We got a room with a balcony which had nice views Coffee machine was an added bonus Very clean rooms and well maintained carpets The breakfast was very neat and had a lot of variety 
400637,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Too small bed for two people in our room , Good location nice staff good breakfast and is clean Very nice bar on the top with good view They offer me 9 euro per person for breakfast on the reception when we arrive 
400638,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Staff weren t particularly attentive and didn t provide a great service when asked for simple things e g two room keys instead of one , Great location really easy to get around the city and surrounded by some great cafes and restaurants
400639,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Unfortunately during our second stay at the hotel a shop fitter nearby was working way past one o clock in the morning and the drilling noise was very unpleasant , The staff members at this hotel have taken service to a whole new level The attention given to guest s needs and requirements and their professional politeness is a refreshing change from other hotels 
400640,Royal Passeig de Gracia, A swimming pool would have been nice but the roof top bar was lovely , Got a free breakfast when we arrived which was ideal super helpful and friendly staff amazing location and beautiful room spotlessly clean Had a wonderful time highly recommended reasonably priced 
400641,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Perhaps a faster wifi , The beds were very comfortable and the staff was extremely helpful They helped us confirm our tour bookings gave us clear directions and they were all very friendly We were surprised by the free champagne on the roof top terrace the night before we left All in an extremely satisfying experience 
400642,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The staff was extremely slow on not very gentle , Amazing location The hotel is located at main fashion road next to all the famous boutiques and the buildings of Gaudi You can go on foot to Las Ramblas Born and all other city centres monuments 
400643,Royal Passeig de Gracia, No concierge function which means no assistance available when front desk is busy Room was quite small we had a room w terrace No light on the terrace can t read after dark Coffee machine was broken and could not be replaced and quite a few other little things you would not expect a a hotel like this , Location breakfast
400644,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The room was small and our view was a wall The window facing a wall allowed a little natural light into the room but in general the room was quite dark even with the lamps on , The location of the hotel was great The staff were friendly and polite also very helpful The room was clean and comfortable

400647,Royal Passeig de Gracia, 18 euros for breakfast was a bit too much especially because the food was cold We hadn t booked breakfast before hand and they offered us a special promotion 2 for 1 Got a feeling it might be something they offer all year round , We were really happy of our choice Service was on point and the roof top bar was a great place to relax after a long day of sightseeing and shopping Room was quiet we stayed on the 5th floor and the bed was comfortable Would stay here again 
400648,Royal Passeig de Gracia, If I m being really picky Cooked breakfast was a bit cold and too much salt Bath towels could be bigger We had a very early departure before breakfast and were not told we could have a take out breakfast although the reception staff knew about our departure time because they booked our taxi for us We were still charged for the breakfast supplement though because it was part of the deal , The staff were very helpful and friendly The room was lovely comfortable and well laid out We had drinks on the roof terrace early evening and at night a great space with very attentive bar staff Overall I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel 
400649,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Luxury room did not have enough complimentary tea and milk and staff were reluctant to provide more I struggled with the pillows but that was more a personal preference , Particularly tasty gluten free bread cake options available at breakfast Great location Free upgrade to luxury room was a great surprise and bonus 
400650,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, The staff were very nice and polite The services the hotel provide are above and beyond the money that we paid The terrace bar is especially lovely and the staff in there are excellent The views from the terrace bar are breath taking

400654,Royal Passeig de Gracia, It is more an office building than a hotel Tiny entrance really packed at rush hours Aggressive perfume or cleaning products that were irritating Opening hours of the terrace, Good Location on top of Pg de Gracia Friendly Staff Modern and comfortable rooms Nice Terrace
400655,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Dressing gown would be good also box of tissues could be attached to wall , All staff were exceptionally helpful Had Catalan breakfast made for me teabags brought to room within 5 minutes request all good 
400656,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The size of the room was very small and the cleaning was very poor The room is has no air as you can t open the windows that was the worst , Location was great 
400657,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Just one man on front desk was a bit standoffish when asking for directions on second day of arrival but I understand as they are pretty busy receiving travellers and managing their bookings , Majority of the front desk and staff were very friendly Breakfast everyday at hotel was great a good variety Location of the hotel was just amazing Both sides of the street had all the designer stores and Gaudi Preredo next block and another Gaudi Bastilo a street or two away Walking on that main street a few blocks from hotel you will hit Rambla and Catalunia Square Amazing location Was a bit pricey ie we paid over Australian Dollars 300 a night for 3 of us Will definitely stay there again nevertheless 
400658,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The breakfast was included in the room charge but it was for limited options and if you order omelet they will charge you 5 Euro and the time for breakfast is from 7 00 to 10 30 only Also there is no SPA But all in all I liked the hotel , The location of the hotel room size and staff cooperation are great
400659,Royal Passeig de Gracia, had forgotten iPad charger and reception did not have one, perfect location for shopping also lots of bars and restos around also just walking distance to el nacionale the transformed old underground carpark which is now a fantastic eatery and drinking venue
400660,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Everything was good , Loved the location and the rooftop terrace bar Reception Staff very friendly same for bar staff options for bar snacks Room nice and spacious and looked onto Passeig de Garcia Bathroom big 
400661,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Nothing to dislike to be truthful If I absolutely have to say something it will be size of the lobby A bigger lobby will be more comfortable and more grand , If this is your first time to Barcelona this is the hotel to stay in The location is absolutely fantastic right smack in the shopping street with plenty of good restaurants nearby not at the main street but at the side streets short walk to metro and a number of key attractions all within walking distance Staff are very friendly esp Peter at the rooftop bar and the ladies at the reception Rooms are modern and comfortable You are off to a good start to explore and enjoy Barcelona 
400662,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Not a serious complaint but the rooms were too warm for us and it was not possible to turn the air conditioning to a lower temperature, The staff The rooms the clean and pleasant atmosphere and the food were all excellent as was the location
400663,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Twins not double bed Pushed together but made up as singles Water provide for 1 night out of a 4 night stay Be better off booking in and out every day Similarly tea and coffee Nice enough hotel but not worthy of its room rates , Location and views Surprisingly Quiet Electric blinds it shouldn t impress but it still does 
400664,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Noise from guests in other rooms music or shouting at 1 a m Housekeeping coming into the room just after 10 a m eventhough I had a Do not disturb sign on the door , Location and staff 
400665,Royal Passeig de Gracia, They dont provide free water only on the first day The breakfast orange juice is not fresh The cleaners dont hesitate to open your room door in the morning They nock and open directlly a matter of seconds and they are in the middle of the room Dont waste your money on pemium room it is the same as comfort because premium is eather a street view or a garden view they may give you a garden view which is exactlly the same as comfort room with courtyard view but they give it two different names and two different prices So just remember the garden the courtyard The garden in the courtyard, The location is on passage de gracia Near the major brands shops A clean and safe area The hotel is nice We stayed 3 weeks 
400666,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The Terrace Bar is a good place for a drink but I don t recommend the tapas there There were two problems with the bathroom the light in the toilet room stopped working and on our last morning the head came off the hand held shower The light was fixed by the electrician and I assume the shower head was fixed after we left Fortunately we were able to use the overhead rain shower , The location is excellent the superior double room very comfortable I really appreciated the powered window shades and every staff member we came in contact with was friendly and helpful They seem to love their jobs The breakfast is wonderful with many selections If you re planning on a full day of touring I highly recommend starting with the hotel s breakfast 
400667,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Strange lighting arrangement in room that left you stranded in the loo in the dark , Lovely room with balcony and amazing view Very friendly smiley staff Great breakfast 
400668,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Nothing to complain about, I thought the hotel was ideally placed very clean and tidy Our room had a lovely big balcony and was a large room The staff were excellent and very helpful all in all excellent
400669,Royal Passeig de Gracia, I feel that all room s should have dressing gowns , I thought the entire hotel was excellent The position the staff the rooms the cleanliness were all top notch 
400670,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Noise during the night that I can hear voice from the room next door and in the morning I hear the sound from streets This really needs to be improved since they claimed that the room is well furnished to reduce the noise from outside And one thing is important for business traveler to know they don t have a private shower room if you are traveling with colleges , Edgy style good location
400671,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, the place was very cool close to everywhere at Barcelona also el camp nou was close to us the street it s full with all market cartier prada hermez ect the roof was fantastic 10 10 16 
400672,Royal Passeig de Gracia, window can not be opened reception staffs were not so friendly and helpful no slippers provided towels are old, location is very good room is clean and modern
400673,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Although clean there was an overpowering chemical smell in the room Ventilation in the room was poor Would not want to stay there in summer , Location
400674,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Sink not draining Dirty walls Didn t like the set up, Got upgraded but room wasn t very nice at all dirty smudges on wall Sink didn t drain told cleaner but didn t get sorted out Bad management and I wouldn t stay there again unless they have more attention to detail and better service
400675,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The room gets warm at night temp is not adjustable , Hotel Royal Passeig de Gracia is well located Sagrada Famalia and Ramblas are walkable distance The metro is in the next block if one does not like to walk Varying degrees of shops and good restaurants are all over the place Finally the hotel staff are all very friendly and accommodating I hope to bring my family to Barcelona and we definitely will be staying here 
400676,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The Room was quite small Double Room was two single beds pushed together , The Hotel is very good location on the main boulevard Walking distance to all the attractions The Roof Top Bar was very nice and relaxing not too busy 
400677,Royal Passeig de Gracia, For such a modern hotels the lifts are surprisingly slow But that is me being picky , Lovely rooms with all mod cons On the 9th floor you get a great view from your balcony and could if the weather was warm relax on a sun lounger taking it all in The hotel is right in the part of Barcelona that most would want to be a stone s throw from Gaudi s Batlo and Pedrera buildings 
400678,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Staff giving wrong information We pay for 2 breakfast only take for one because we need to catch the early flight have to leave hotel around 7 00am Staff who take my payment is very bad Use different language to say something I think is not good in front of us something about Chinese, 
400679,Royal Passeig de Gracia, No open windows in the bedroom could provide better bathroom toiletries, Good service Breakfast buffet excellent beautiful rooms perfect location Modern design beautiful view of city on terrace great bathroom and layout
400680,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Night room service is only available through an outside restaurant that brings food after 1 2 an hour, Perfect location Very smart helpful receptionists
400681,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Room was stuffy and claustrophobic A small window that opened onto the internal wind shaft provided no light or fresh air Glass panel instead of a door on the bathroom was dangerous and afforded no privacy Website should have described the room more fully and accurately , Location 
400682,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, We cannot fault this hotel the staff were excellent friendly and helpful and the hotel was immaculate We could not hear any noise from outside or from adjoining rooms so it felt peaceful and relaxing The views from the rooftop bar were breathtaking 
400683,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, The location is perfect we walked to all the key sites from the Hotel Staff are very friendly and great at giving recommendations and sightseeing advice 
400684,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The bathroom was not enclosed completely , The property was in an upscale and not too crowded area and was accessible to many sites The roof top lounge was nice 
400685,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Didn t try the breakfast At 18 euros per head was extortionate even if the setting was good , The location was perfect and the room very quiet Near enough to everything but in a beautiful spot away from the mass of people in La Rambla yet only 10 minutes walk away The glass topped bar was fantastic for a view of Barcelona 
400686,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The toilet leaked and the water from the shower didn t drain causing the bathroom to flood Had problems with the lift if we were going down to the ground floor and it stopped in between it then went up agian very frustrating , Good size room that was clean Comfortable bed Pleasant staff
400687,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Quite pricey I wouldn t have stayed here if I was travelling on my own money No swimming pool fitness centre Would have stayed in the nearby Doubletree Hilton but they had no free rooms , Very central location close to the Metro Free wifi had good connection Room was bigger than at the nearbly Doubletree Hilton but more expensive 
400688,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Could not get the internet part of the TV to work but no great hardship , Offered an upgrade on arrival which included two cocktails on the roof terrace the drinks were the price of the upgrade so in effect free upgrade The roof terrace bar was great nice views over the city Room was large as was the TV Would defenately stay here again 
400689,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Small toilet, The Hotel is in the Heart of the city If you love to shop and roam around the city then this is the hotel you should stay Breakfast is ok Not much options if you don t eat Pork Staffs were very helpful and cooperative 
400690,Royal Passeig de Gracia, I thought the room was really overpriced for its size and quality the roof top bar mainly attracted us but we couldn t use it on the first night and wasn t informed it was unavailable even on the day of booking in , Location was very good as was the staff
400691,Royal Passeig de Gracia, I forgot my super charger cord at their front desk as they were kind enough to charge for me My fault , The staff went out of their way to accommodate any and all of my needs for my first trip to Europe Clara Julia Felix Eric and Maria to name just a few were stellar 
400692,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Both myself and My Wife were bitten by some kind of Bugs which it never happened to me in any trip I am travelling around the world Which Still I am not sure happened in this hotel or Somewhere outside in city I am not Sure , In Center and accessible to lots of Places
400693,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The hot breakfast was cold the croissants weren t great and the coffee was awful , Friendly staff stylish clean and comfortable room Great location Would stay again without taking breakfast there are lots of places to eat near by 
400694,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The bathroom in particular was tiny Nowhere to hang put anything in the bathroom had to put wash stuff and nightie on the floor Nowhere to put the clothes you had just climbed out of Would suit a single person I suppose Hanging space in the wardrobe wouldn t even hang my husbands jacket without buckling up no chance to hang a dress About three small drawers nothing else , Central location quiet room 
400695,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The three lifts are rather slow there is only one lift to get access to the bar terrace on the roof and the service at this bar is was extremely slow , Nice breakfast modern appearance of the lobby the corridors and the rooms including the bathroom 
400696,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Photo advertised shows the le Pedrera lit up at night We visited the roof top bar to see le Pedrera lit up at night and it is blocked to be unable to see it ,No Positive
400697,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Heavy doors meant you heard everyone entering and leaving in your room Cleaning staff are too noisy and also too eager they took away my plate twice before I finished Not enough facilities for the price Breakfast and mini bar too expensive, Location is good
400698,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Facilities, We advised the staff that the shower head was broken on our first day but nothimg was fixed during the 4 days in the hotel The hotel has over ch as rged us which we have a ked why but have not had a response
400699,Royal Passeig de Gracia, There was only shampoo and body lotion in bathroom For a hotel this good there could at least be hair conditioner , The location was really good and central The roof bar was very enjoyable Alsa room was spacious 
400700,Royal Passeig de Gracia, AC was not working properly and noisy little in the morning The Bath sink was not properly functioning and full of water, Location is nearby and walking distance to Placa Catalunia
400701,Royal Passeig de Gracia, One room was nice 410 the other was much smaller 609 facing a concrete wall windows cannot be opened the receprion personell is very nice but absolutely incompetent the roof bar is overprices food sushi gets delivered from a take away restarant across the street the reeprion smells of some artificial parfume so check in and out gives you a headache from teh smell wifi for 6 euro a day very bad connection in the lobby, The hotel is well located in walking distance from Rambla and Sagrada Familia it has nice roof bar
400702,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Terrace bar could be better Served cold red wine so called tapas was a few pieces of cheeze not well dressed staff, Location room staff in the reception and breakfastroom
400703,Royal Passeig de Gracia, see above location is very good close to Metro miss no posdibility to open a window , The Elevator to the roof was broken had to wait long for the small Elevator and many stops Staff was nice but not informed about necessity for time tickets by popular attractions and did not make an effort to inform themselves for better advice for guests Oh wrong comment box 
400704,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The lifts they seemed to have a mind of their own , The staff were all friendly and exceptionally helpful It is rare to get such amazing service as we were given They all deserve a massive pay rise Special mention though for Clara a receptionist par excellence who went above and beyond the call of duty when we arrived at the hotel early in the morning several hours before we were originally due Well done 
400705,Royal Passeig de Gracia, One of the elevators was broken during our entire stay 5 days which resulted in extremely long waiting times no gym, Very friendly staff spacious rooms amazing breakfast
400706,Royal Passeig de Gracia, All was fabulous , The staff at reception were helpful and attentive The location was excellent not far from my favourite Cervezeria on Carrer de Majorca The roof bar is a wonderful highlight of this hotel with Felix and Rose Anna making the best of hosts 
400707,Royal Passeig de Gracia, hotel is very expensive comparing with the services it provides, nothing hotel facilities were so poor while it has a great location their rooms are so small and no windows no bell boy to collect your luggage
400708,Royal Passeig de Gracia, absolutley noisy room you can hear everything neighbours kids running around in the room next to you doors opening and closing rooms on 6th floor seem to lack proper sound isolation for this category of hotel it should be improved, the friendly staff location is great 
400709,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Room was small and poorly equipped No iron nor ironing board as advertised Safe was located so high that one had to stand on a chair to access it Cleaning staff was observed to clean our used glasses and cups using dirty towels from the bathroom floor , Location is great Staff is very professional friendly and helpful 
400710,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The room booked by us looked completely different live so they did not even argue to change it The staff was not helpful on giving us travel tips for Barcelona The keys from the room as well as from the garage were not constantly working They charged us after departure by unknown reason though everything was paid by us , The staff helped us to upgrade the room booked earlier
400711,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Standard and superior rooms are small on request we were upgraded to what must have been a junior suite which was very comfortable The views from the rooms we saw were severely obscured by large metal panels added for architectural effect and certainly not for the benefit of residents The only way to get fresh air in the rooms was to open a large window door by a very small amount for safety reasons The window was kept locked and we had to ask many times for it to be re opened An annoying detail and a consequence of poor building design , Very clean rooms Good breakfast Staff efficient if somewhat aloof 
400712,Royal Passeig de Gracia, However unfortunately after we left the hotel they charged our card without notification for items we had already declared at check out and paid for In addition they did not give us the option to pay our bill in the local currency instead deciding unilaterally that they would charge us in pounds sterling Up until that point we had enjoyed our stay but this changed things and I would now think twice before staying there again , On the whole it was a lovely hotel location wise and staff wise 
400713,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, The breakfast was great clean and plenty of choices the room are great but at first we had a room with no door bath the we have changed it the next day Wifi is fine but somehow slow the location is great just to close to the metros and to the big plazas
400714,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Rooms a little small Breakfast menu was same every day and hot food was limited , Excellent location Building and rooms updated recently and in excellent condition Great bar on the roof 
400715,Royal Passeig de Gracia, There s no door separating the bathroom area from the rest of the room it s probably ok if you travel as a couple but not with your friends, Excellent location walk distance to main attractions but also close to a metro station room was very clean confortable bed good A C and wifi friendly and helpful staff nice view from the terrace
400716,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Airco makes noise and when switched off room becomes too warm Windows cannot be opened for fresh air So not easy to find the right temperature for sleeping , Nice roof terrace and close to City centre 
400717,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Absolutely nothing , Everything our room was perfect deluxe double with terrace view of sagrada familia and the roof of casa mila Great facilities in room and really peaceful The staff were all superb couldn t have been more helpful friendly or polite Location is perfect lovely clean safe are perfect to access the city on foot or by metro Rooftop terrace is fabulous and Rosanna makes beautiful cocktails We wouldn t hesitate to book here again 
400718,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, Great location Modern comfortable hotel good for visiting everything as near to 2 Metro Stations as well as walkable to many attractions Great roof terrace a good place to relax with a drink after a day s sightseeing Friendly and efficient staff throughout Thoroughly recommend 
400719,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The room described in booking website did not match to reality There are no living room and an available iron like described in the booking voucher and this is a wrong way to make business Wifi provided doesnt work , Probably the hotel has the greatest city location reception is friendly and helpful ready to solve issues Breakfast is awesome 
400720,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Booking com canceled my booking unnecessarily for no reason then had to do another booking at reception but for 130 Euro more Why, Location and staff
400721,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Booked as breakfast originally but When airlines brought forward our Departure we rang 13 day prior to arrival cancelled the breakfast To our surprise we found out they booked us as single and we re going to charge us for an extra breakfast if we did have breakfast Booking is clearly under two names James Nella Girgin THAT IS VERY WRONG , Location 
400722,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Windows of room are fixed and cannot be opened and airconditions in the rooms don t have ventilation so there isn t enough fresh air for a nice sleep Duvets are covered with a huge bedsheet which doesn t let you to have nice sleep We had to fight with betsheets and duvet all night , Hotel location is great It is in the middle of everything Breakfast they offer is rich and has something for everyone Rooms are clean and have android pc attached to tv Free internet was fast enough for watching hd movie 
400723,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, We had a great deal through booking com and then the whole party was upgraded plus a reduction for breakfast The rooms were nicely appointed and the beds were very comfortable slept like a log each night The breakfast was excellent All the staff were helpful and friendly The roof top bar had a fantastic panoramic view and delicious home made sangria added to the sense of holiday relaxation 
400724,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Nothing But be careful of the pickpockets in the underground station taking a bus would be a better choice , You can walk to Casa Milan and Casa Batllo also Sagrada Familia Buy a transport travel pass then you don t need to buy single ticket anymore The hotel s easy to find and the receptionists works effectively and sweet The breakfast was perfect Station Diagonal is the nearest 
400725,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Staff are good my room balcony was great The hotel terrace is beautiful , The hotel is very clean staff are helpful location is good The bathroom has no privacy no water supply in the toilet 
400726,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The booking deposit should be max by two days of arriving but they deposit me by one week without any notice house keeping 8 hours only from 9 am to 4 pm they put paper on my bed in first day if the room need deep cleaning will deposit me min 300 Euro this not mentioned before in reservation very small reception the decoration very dark and lighting no good to change towel you should put in the floor of bathroom safe box no good my child change password two times alone the staff not friendly not welcoming and rigid i think because pressure of work, Free WiFi
400727,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, Room was clean and spacious wifi connection was strong breakfast had a huge spread of bread pastries and fruits which were really fresh Hotel also kindly helped us store our luggages for a week as we were coming back to the hotel again 
400728,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, Excellent location just round the corner from the main Gaudi attraction In the heart of the posh shopping area Very friendly and helpful staff Car parking underneath rare in the middle of Barcelona 
400729,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The atitude of the staff and we asked few things on city no knowledgs No night bed time service and we had to pay for one hour late check out which is not weird bc usually ww never paid in other hotel , The upgrade room
400730,Royal Passeig de Gracia, The view from the terrace was superb but we couldn t stay for drinks as the prices were exorbitant way over our budget so we just looked at the view and left We paid half the price for drink on the same avenue just a minute away Reduce your bar prices and I m sure you ll get far more customers up there There were only two couples there when we went up , Ideal location Clean modern rooms Friendly staff Stunning terrace 
400731,Royal Passeig de Gracia, wi fi was really slow had to reset the floor a few times We were told that this is and eco hotel so A C was set at a temperature that was not cool enough for my wife and I after I called they reset to 19C from 21C, Great location right next to two Gaudi s houses great roof top bar you could see Gaudi s church clean most of the staff were very helpful Located on the Fifth Avenue of Barcelona Gucci Prada Louie Vuitton etc 
400732,Royal Passeig de Gracia, I wouldn t say it was a bad experience but the bathroom lacks a door As I was traveling with a friend privacy was compromised The bathroom was beautifully finished though , Great location up market feel in the decor helpful staff and the electric black out blinds make for a very good night sleep Breakfast is also very good and the roof top bar has a great view of the city 
400733,Royal Passeig de Gracia, It wasnt a bad experience but im from greece if I couldn t speak english I would have had a lot of difficulty , The shower was impeccable the cleaning staff were very helpful The reception desk staff were also extremely friendly helpful 
400734,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Premium room is nothing different with comfort room except for higher pricing and so called city view with very tiny space and low ceiling Requested room change but no response till next morning and been told that we had to stay for one more night accrodingly to their inhouse policy Got shift to a bigger room the 2nd night but we finally decided to move to another hotel nearby Very bad experience and would not recommand to others , Location only 
400735,Royal Passeig de Gracia, Wish there was a 24 7 restaurant, Terrific location 
400736,Royal Passeig de Gracia,No Negative, Eating breakfast in the outside courtyard was a great start to the day and an evening drinkl in the rooftop lounge was fantastic
