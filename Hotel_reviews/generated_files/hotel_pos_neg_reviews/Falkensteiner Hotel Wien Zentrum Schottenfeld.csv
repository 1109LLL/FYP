446000,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, On our 1st check in the reception staff did not read the booking information correctly On arrival we were advised we had only booked 1 room but in fact we had booked 2 rooms The staff announced the cost of breakfast when in fact we had a booking including breakfast We had booked to stay again a couple of nights later as were travelling to Slovakia and returned to Vienna for our flight home again the reception staff advised us of the cost of breakfast even though we had a booking which included breakfast , Breakfast was excellent
446001,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, Restaurant not open at weekends some restaurants near by but not a massive choice after a full day of sight seeing would have been nice to be able to eat at the hotel Would stop me staying again at a weekend , Hotel very friendly staff excellent breakfast rooms nice and clean
446002,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, no complaints, Friendly staff clean and nice rooms not so noisy like other hotels supermarket around the corner underground in walking distance great breakfast buffet espresso machine 
446003,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, Standard room is to small for a 4 star hotel Really too small , Location Near Museum Qvartier and Maria Hilfe Strasse The hotel has a great parking at an affordable price for Viena The stuff is helpful and kindness 
446004,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, If I have to be picky I would have liked A double duvet instead of two small ones however it did mean I could wrap myself up in it But that really didn t matter much to me at all Did not ruin the holiday And the bed was MASSIVE so was great , The location of the hotel is in a superb area We went for a Christmas trip and it was close to the local markets and only a twenty minute walk to the big markets If walking seems far it is actually a bonus because you get to view everything as you walk Only a 30 euro uber ride to and from the airport The hotel room was warm and cosy and had all the facilities 
446005,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, High parking fees high room rate for the standard room facilities They had not even the one use slippers in the bath and offered to buy flippers Extra services were expensive The room facilities were standard The internet connection did not work properly and we had to go very close to the door for having a good connection , The hotel is centrally located and you could reach the sightseeings of Vienna easily by walking The staff was very friendly and always ready to help us
446006,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, Upon checking out the receptionist a new hire I think charged me for two breakfasts 18 euro a piece without asking if I had any The end sum sounded too much so I asked for a list of what he was charging me for When I pointed out that I had only one breakfast and none the day of checking out he said oh okay and without apologising at all removed the item I paid I was waiting for my cab when he ran after me and said he shouldn t have charged me for the room either since the website where I booked already did Well I should have checked that too and they reimbursed me for the charge but to a card in another currency since they cannot recharge it on Maestro So I certainly lost a few euros on that All of this is atypical of Falkensteiner as I know it but it wasn t a nice feeling , Very nice hotel my favourite in Vienna not that I know them all modern comfortable great small gym uniquely delicious breakfast great location warm staff 
446007,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, far from metro station around 25min walk hallways smells cigarette couldnt open the windows staff opened the door right after knoking to ask us about the service quality which was kinda weird , helpful staff cleanliness good wifi quiet room 
446008,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, The bed was a little bit smaller for two people than what many other 4 and up hotels offer The deluxe double room serves its basic purpose but isn t anything amazing , Decent hotel very friendly staff 
446009,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, Check in and check out staff were robotic offering no personal service Breakfast at the offered 18 per person seemed expensive compared to other options in the area , Reasonable hotel which is a 25 minute walk from the centre of Vienna Quiet rooms of a good size reasonably fitted out Good wifi

446011,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, no bathtub in the junior suite suite on the first floor huge amount of curtains to cover bare walls why not a painting or two the overall state is outdated walls need to be refreshed no balcony or ceiling windows as presented on booking com, big room big bathroom nice area
446012,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, During our two night stay in the hotel the cleaning staff managed to surprise disturb us three times with entering or trying to enter our room even when the Do not disturb table was indicated The last day out of the two the cleaning lady after she was knocking on the door immediately opened it while I was just finished with showering That was quite annoying taking into consideration that we supposed to leave in the following hours Shouldn t be the policy to wait until checking out , The room included everything we ve needed during our short stay The staff at reception were nice and helpful 
446013,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, Breakfast is rather expensive , Really friendly and helpful staff We had a problem with the shower cubicle in our bathroom and they handled the entire situation extremely well I was upgraded to a suite and given a complementary fruit and muffin platter Despite the incident I would happily book there again 
446014,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, I like the entrance and lobby for your hotel and restaurent service all its clean, The kind of towel in bathroom are not good in a big hotel like you the quality
446015,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, The room has some small defects like a sink with broken piece in a corner A very expensive breakfast 18 euro , Good location quite close to the centre but at the same time not too busy with tourists and traffic Bed was comfortable and the bathroom was unusually quite big All in all very good quality for the paid price I would go back 
446016,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, Nothing, It s a lovely hotel with very friendly staff central to loads of sightseeing and loads of pubs and restaurants The breakfast has a large variety and is very tasty 
446017,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, The air conditioning in the room was noisy and ineffective in the room this was not reported to reception so I cannot rate the hotel on their response There was a mini bar in the room which I don t like in general as they are very expensive Breakfast was 18 per person per day which was very expensive considering there are lots of places to eat close by , The room was very comfortable and clean Good gym facilities and fantastic staff who were incredibly helpful The hotel was modern and very efficient in all areas Free use of a safe Showers were powerful 
446018,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, Limited breakfast Staff not helpful at breakfast At some distance from a metro station , Clean room with comfortable bed Good facilities with large bathroom

446020,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, A bit far from the metro station but still reachable on the foot My card was preauthorized for the first night on the day I booked even though it was stated that I will pay when I stay Even more I was told that preauthorized amount can t be used for payment and that I have to pay for entire stay while reservation itself will stay until it expires , Very clean and comfortable room friendly stuff Walking distance from the center 
446021,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, The shower was bit broken it was off the wall And it was very very warm in the room had to keep window open all the time , Great choice of breakfast good size room loved the mini dressing room and that bathroom had both bath and shower we had room in the older side but rooms on the new side were also great There s also a sauna ja small gym available in the hotel 
446022,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, The selection in the minibar could be better and bigger , I love the gym small but very good machines I love the breakfast good choice though the scrambled eggs looked very unappetizing but lots of fruit and veggies and nuts and so on Missing the herring they always used to have Great policy to have apples around at the reception all day long and coffee in the morning The water with the fruit gets problematic by the afternoon Good location nice staff Would welcome more deals not just for the weekend 
446023,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, Breakfast is too expensive Any bakery around the corner is more convenient unless you need a huge breakfast , Everything that one needs for a short stay in Vienna Good location helpful staff The wood glass door and wall of the bathroom give a nice touch 
446024,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, Getting into the downtown took a bus and a few stops on the metro Both ran very regularly Walking into the downtown would have only been 30 minutes but it was a bit cold for us to walk that far , The staff was very helpful in getting us various day tours in Vienna and Budapest that included a hotel pickup in the morning My son s favorite part was the heated floors in the bathroom 
446025,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, Location was too far away from the main city downtown and the connection with the public transportation was also not so clear , Quite nice room interior and enough large size for our double room Very clean 
446026,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, we went to a lot of trouble to find out whether this hotel restaurant was open over the Christmas period They did not respond to our emails but responded immediately when Bookings com contacted them They sent sample menus and confirmed that the restaurant was open throughout It was closed on our 1st night and we were directed to their sister hotel several miles away We had no option as most restaurants are closed on Christmas Eve The meal was expensive and medioca We tried our hotel restaurant again on Christmas Day but it was shut so we had to find somewhere else to eat , When things went wrong they investigated and sent fruit cakes and wine to our room 
446027,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, The hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood which is quite far if you want to walk to the main attractions You can use the bus and tram though We missed the amenities in the bathroom We only got a soap dispenser in the shower which was almost empty and was not re filled during our stay Also towels are quite basic for a 4 star hotel , Breakfast is amazing Staff is nice and helpful The coffee machine in the room is excellent 
446028,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, Hated the shower Despite a cool pillow menu none of the pillows really worked out for us, Staff was friendly and helpful Located near a bus line with easy access to downtown Vienna Seems very pet friendly
446029,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, Only miscellaneous issues We found breakfast to be 18 person which is pretty much expensive had no chance to check wether it worth the cost Not much light in the room Nothing to dry towels or other clothing on , Great personnel Everybody were supportive when we needed to find working food and medicine stores on 25 26 December to open bottle of wine order a taxi or just to navigate us to local sights Everything went smoothly 
446030,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, Staff were totally uninterested Couldn t have been less bothered by our presence Not unhelpful just totally distant I guess this is what you get from a corporate chain hotel It almost felt like they knew we paid less than the market rate so we got less of a service I ve never experienced that before when using Booking com , Great room great coffee machine and lovely modern hotel Thought I d comment on the location which seems to get mixed reviews If you re lazy this isn t the place for you Clearly you do have to walk places but it s about 10 to 15 minutes to Hofberg Palace and the Rathaus so it s hardly very far Also the location is in a relatively quiet area which is nice and is near the Spittelberg area which has good well priced local restaurants and pubs The Zieglergasse underground is less than a 10 minute walk away too handy for transport to further out places like the Hauptbahnhoff took about 15 minutes with one change All in all we were very happy with the location especially for the price we paid about 90 Euros per night 
446031,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Zentrum Schottenfeld, Can t read in the room Lights are not strong enough to see properly , Nice neighborhood great Christmas market nearby We would choose this hotel again Parking convenient
