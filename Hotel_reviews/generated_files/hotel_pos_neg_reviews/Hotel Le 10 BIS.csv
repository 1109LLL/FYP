18396,Hotel Le 10 BIS, Nothing, The staff were extremely pleasant and efficient The d cor of the hotel was dark which really should not have worked but in reality the effect was fabulous 
18397,Hotel Le 10 BIS, Room was compact but comfortable We were disappointed with lack of drinking cups to make hot drinks No milk and sugar provided and paper cups not replaced Im sure for the price we paid they could have provided all these , The staff at reception were very friendly and accomodating The location is excellent Close to metro shops restaurants Mcdonalds and walking distance to Arche De Triomphe 
18398,Hotel Le 10 BIS, Honestly we were happy with everything , I like that the hotel was in an old building that had been fully renovated to a modern style We were unexpectedly upgraded to a suite that was more than roomy and was tastefully decorated I particulary liked the large tub with push button shower The location was very good walking distance to lots of attractions but on a quiet side street Hotel employees were very friendly I would definitely stay here again 
18399,Hotel Le 10 BIS,No Negative, Excellent location and easy to get to from the Airport Tram stops only a 2 minute walk away and located 10 minute walk away from the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees Very close to a little supermarket and nice bakeries as well as a couple of bars as a nice pit stop on the way back The room is lovely and the coffee is a nice little extra
