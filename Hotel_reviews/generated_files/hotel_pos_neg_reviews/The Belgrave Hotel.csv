250886,The Belgrave Hotel, If I had to improve something it would be that hot breakfast should be included in the breakfast price and not cost extra We did not opt in for breakfast for this reason , Best hotel I ve stayed in in the UK I particularly loved the staff their willingness to help you even at silly o clock in the morning 
250887,The Belgrave Hotel, Rooms could have been bigger for an exec room, We liked that it was close to the tube and that the hotel was welcoming We enjoyed the continental breakfast but felt that the cooked breakfast could have been included in the rate rather than extra this always seem to say if in London you get charged more making the short break say more bout monies spent rather than the whole London experience 
250888,The Belgrave Hotel, Windows were thin so when your room is at the driveways side you pretty much hear everything Room didn t have refrigerator , Breakfast was excellent and rooms were better than we thought they would be Really close to Victorias station and Pimlico line Good soundproof between the rooms

250916,The Belgrave Hotel, We had a difficult time finding the hotel on the first day We walked from Pimlico station and we were looking for the hotel sign but completely missed it because the sign was so small and indiscreet printed on a post outside of the front entrance , We enjoyed our one week stay at the hotel The staff were extremely friendly and helpful It was just a short walk to get to either the Pimlico or Victoria Tube stations Our room was very clean and comfortable nicely updated and modern We appreciated that the hotel provided us with a complimentary smart phone that was preloaded with maps and city guides very handy for first time visitors There was a nice selection of items for breakfast and the service and setting were excellent 
250917,The Belgrave Hotel, Can t think of anything I had a problem with, Very nice hotel Room small but it was all that was needed and not smaller than other hotels I ve stayed in when in central London Brilliant shower although make sure you let the water in both the normal shower and the Cascade warm up before you switch from one to the other or you could get a shock Comfortable bed quiet room friendly staff and good continental breakfast with plenty of staff around to help My partner s brother and his partner live in Sweden and mentioned they plan to use this hotel for their base in the future when in London

250923,The Belgrave Hotel, Lovely hotel but very noisy room in the basement so got little sleep Raised the problem with front desk but nothing done or offered to resolve this very poor service, clean hotel
250924,The Belgrave Hotel, Really couldn t fault the hotel and facilities maybe only the cost of a cup of tea in the lounge but that is all, Bed was superb Staff couldn t have been more helpful Breakfast was perfect Loved the extra mobile phone in the room and nespresso coffee machine
250925,The Belgrave Hotel, The door could not be locked from inside they fixed it after reminding them lots of times there was no hot water for one day we could hear the people walking above us because of the thin roof same breakfast everyday we stayed 6 days and paid 1 300 pounds to have all the above issues The person anchorage did not bother to even appologize instead telling the staff what to tell us ,No Positive
250926,The Belgrave Hotel, Slightly bigger room would have been nice but no big deal I stayed in an executive double with a colleague We worked in the lounge so the work desk while nice sized took up breathing space in the room , Much more of an intimate boutique hotel than is suggested by the picture The room we had was smallish for 2 people but not by European standards The bed was comfortable the staff was very accommodating and the continental breakfast was fantastic cold meats cheeses yoghurt fruit croissants and on and on Really nice bathroom with rainfall shower and yummy toiletries The lounge has a couple different seating areas and the bar was always open The location is excellent just a stone s throw from Pimlico underground 
250927,The Belgrave Hotel, small rooms no hot water for first 24 hours due to broken boiler good area for Apollo Victoria theatre, comfy bed nice decor in reception and breakfast areas lovely coffee
250928,The Belgrave Hotel, The room was too small for 2 people we didn t even have place to put our suitcases The bed was terrible the hotel can invest in some new mattresses We were very disappointed we paid a lot for nothing We should rather have stayed at a chain hotel , The breakfast was good The location of the hotel is good near to the Victoria station where we left our rental car 
250929,The Belgrave Hotel, I would have liked to have had a bath in our executive room but that didn t detract from the overall fabulous stay For non business travellers it would have been nicer for guests to have a later breakfast time , Super comfy bed lovely spacious room Perfect for an overnight stay as a couple for a special occasion Shower was great as was breakfast Would definitely recommend as the location was only 5 minutes walk from Pimlico and the staff were really helpful and friendly 
250930,The Belgrave Hotel, There was some noise from the room above which woke me up at 2am I guess this was because there is no sound proofing or people coming in at 2am don t tend to be aware of the noise they make, The service was good and the room was fine if a little small even though I knew it was a single room The location was excellent for me 
250931,The Belgrave Hotel, Noisy i e people from above can be heard walking across the floor from our room woken up from music being played from the restaurant before breakfast was served , Modern comfortable bed and clean Shower is great 
250932,The Belgrave Hotel, Noise from above We were in 401 and there was noise all night sounded like someone was constantly walking up and down on creeky boards which was hard to sleep 2nd night , Breakfast was lovely All fresh Nice touches to room with toiletries slippers etc
250933,The Belgrave Hotel, Small bar with limited beer options , The room was bigger than I expected I was in a room at ground level and right at the foot path outside and the busy road but the sound insulation was great Really friendly and helpful staff Good location with public transport available and pubs all around if you look 
250934,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, We were very happy with the staff Manos in particular could not have been any more accommodating Loved the free phone to take around the city that the hotel offers The breakfast included everything and was never out of anything Close to underground transportation which makes the location very good 
250935,The Belgrave Hotel, Could not sleep well The aircon in the room does not work and has to be controlled form the reception The amount of noise made early in the morning made it impossible for me to sleep , The location was brilliant Facilities offered were good 
250936,The Belgrave Hotel, Couldn t fill kettle from bathroom tap due to design of mixer tap and restricted sink space Could not fit one of my chargers in mains socket due to overhanging shelf , Fresh new clean environment Great location Wifi access Restaurant Bar 
250937,The Belgrave Hotel, Size of the room My partner had just finished the London Marathon and struggled to navigate round the bed due to lack of space , Clean and comfortable room very quiet 
250938,The Belgrave Hotel, Only stayed for 1 night wish it had been more , Room was clean warm and comfortable staff were friendly polite and professional Breakfast was excellent plenty of choice well cooked and presentable Everything was accessible from hotel 
250939,The Belgrave Hotel, It ll be good if they installed some clothes hooks on the wall Not much space to hang coats etc , Nice modern rooms Loved the nespresso coffee slippers toiletries etc Very well thought Was really impressed with the free use of Handy a device for us to surf net etc and the night snack delivery service We arrived at 10pm and was so hungry and tired So it s really a nice touch Great location Bus stop for 24 is just nearby You can walk to Pimlico or Victoria station Or walk to Buckingham palace Westminster etc 
250940,The Belgrave Hotel, We were in a basement room so the view was nt great Like all London hotels the rooms are small The disadvantages were well out weighed by the advantages, All the members of staff we encountered were bright welcoming and helpful most impressive It s a peaceful location very near to the bustle of Victoria station The breakfast was good the full English perfectly cooked to order 
250941,The Belgrave Hotel, The only complaint was that you had to pay an extra 4 each per day for a full breakfast, The staff was all really helpful and friendly the rooms are clean and the bed was really comfy
250942,The Belgrave Hotel, Unpolite staff in the breakfast room Nice looking bathroom but no place to hang clothes no space by the sink The floor uneven in the room We heard every step from the guest above us starting very early in the morning, Nice balcony good location
250943,The Belgrave Hotel, Warmer room on arriving , Staff were fantastic extremely knowledgable about london transport theatres attractions and nothing was too much trouble Breakfast first class and cleanliness of rooms and all areas pristine
250944,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very friendly Anybody booking a hotel room in central London should manage their expectations of the size of room they are going to get The room here was Bijou but was adequate for my purposes Room was saved by having rainfall shower rather than a bath and by having a queen bed rather than a full size double but since I was travelling alone this was fine The hotel is within walking distance of Pimlico tube and in a very nice area of London
250945,The Belgrave Hotel, Couldn t fill kettle under tap Bed was a little soft , Room was described as compact and was exactly that But enough room for bed bathroom and hospitality tray and TV Liked decaf coffee being present without having to ask for it Check in was very friendly Included Continental breakfast was perfectly adequate 
250946,The Belgrave Hotel, My room on the ground floor at the back 03 seemed to be a little cold for sitting in the room even though I played with the wall heat controller However the room temperature was fine for sleeping , Location is great for walking to Victoria Rail Station to get the Gatwick Express 
250947,The Belgrave Hotel, Our Double room was extremely clean and modern but too small for 2 adults for 2 nights No wardrobe or anywhere to put luggage which was a shame but would still reccomend, Very clean hotel close to the amenities we wanted
250948,The Belgrave Hotel, Very small room looking out on a brick wall Asked for a top floor room was given first floor People in room above stomping around at 6am for hours No soundproofing No storage space for clothes We have visited on previous occasions but this time not so good , Location
250949,The Belgrave Hotel, Going home , The stay was fantastic from start to finish We couldn t fault the service facilities The staff were very friendly and professional The room was superb as was breakfast 
250950,The Belgrave Hotel, The size of the room we had an executive double it was very small , The breakfast was lovely lots of choice and well presented All staff were very helpful and welcoming The decor and attention to detail in all areas of the hotel including the room was excellent 
250951,The Belgrave Hotel, It s an older buildung that was recently renovated but the rooms are badly isolated It could be less comfortable if you have loud neighbours , Good located nice hotel for younger people The staff was friendly and we could go to our room earlier than stated without extra charge A great benefit was the phone we received for usage on the go with internet very handy if you quickly need to check a location on google maps 
250952,The Belgrave Hotel, The sink location underneath a shelf in the bathroom meant I was unable to wash my face without having my head on the shelf Not enough space to store my wash things in the bathroom Lots of lights in the room however no main light left the room very dim Only mirror in the room on the wardrobe , The bed was comfortable Friendly staff 
250953,The Belgrave Hotel, Only issue was on last night when the occupants of room above were moving about a lot in the night and disturbed my wife s sleep Suspect it was noisy due to laminate floors and lack of noise insulation below the top surface or ceiling of room to dampen the sound Not entirely hotel fault as cannot control guests nocturnal movements and they were not being loud and rowdy in any way but perhaps had a middle of the night start Consider we were unlucky to have those guests above us for that night and it would not put us off returning another time, Breakfast was excellent quality and replenished by staff who were both efficient and courteous Whole hotel was clean and welcoming with very friendly staff Good pleasant location away from noise and disturbance of the city but within close walking distance to most of what you want to see as a tourist in London 
250954,The Belgrave Hotel, No negatives If they had an evening restaurant may be good , Every where was so clean Decor exellent Shower rooms small but very adaquate Staff lovley Pimlico is a great area to stay Easy walk to Victoria and Pimlico underground Will be the place I stay when visiting London 
250955,The Belgrave Hotel, Below average breakfast definitely not at a 4 star hotel level Asked to pay at check in pretty unusual for a 4 star hotel reception staff not very attentive and customer oriented Hard to identify the location in absence of a visible logo except a very discrete one on the column next to the entrance no ashtray in front no trash can in the lobby , Clean good room facilities comfortable bed Excellent coffee maker cell phone companion with free wifi and calls 
250956,The Belgrave Hotel, Limited clothes storage in the room but it was fine for a 1 or 2 night stay Everything else was good , Handy for underground and major tourist attractions Good continental breakfast included Super efficient check in and when we checked out they stored our luggage until later in the afternoon 
250957,The Belgrave Hotel, I don t think it could have been better, First time at a London hotel where I haven t looked forward to my own bed Bed was excellent Also to be given a smartphone for the duration with free calls and 4G was wonderful 
250958,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, Quiet room friendly staff excellent breakfast facilities my room on the fifth floor had a wide view of the London rooftops with Battersea Power station in the background 
250959,The Belgrave Hotel, The bathroom was far to small, The bed was really comfy the room clean and nice The bathroom was far to small it was difficult to dry yourself after the shower due to no room 
250960,The Belgrave Hotel, No coat hooks in room Could have had boiled eggs available at breakfast, Nice comfortable modern room Excellent shower Nice quiet Nice location Good breakfast
250961,The Belgrave Hotel, The room could have been a bit bigger and the bathroom too we felt like we were falling over one another at times Explanation on how to use the information panel on the outside of the room to let staff know you didn t want to be disturbed bit awkward when we were getting ready to go out , Very comfortable bed and big too Good that you can actually open the window in the room too The shower was really nice and big just what you needed Good beverage prices especially for London 
250962,The Belgrave Hotel, No instructions for the air conditioning room cold but sorted, Very comfortable great location within walking distance of Victoria station about 8 minutes Plenty of restaurants around Staff very friendly and helpful Very clean
250963,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was far better than expected considering the price I paid for London area It is central not far from museum s In the evening when to an excellent little bistro about 2 hundreds yards across the road 
250964,The Belgrave Hotel, Nets on bathroom window not just blinds And the bedroom window doors were faulty very difficult to close once opened , Room cleaned daily and drinking facilities replenished daily Very good that we were able to leave our bags behind reception before check in 
250965,The Belgrave Hotel, The noise of the floor above us when someone was walking was quite annoying and disrupted our sleep i think it was a cleaners room above us there were a lot of footsteps from 7 onwards in the morning , Staff were friendly the beds were comfy location was good and breakfast was good 
250966,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, Excellent hotel in a perfect location if you are visiting the Apollo Theatre to watch a show About 10 minute walk from Victoria Coach Station and walking distance to Buckingham Palace If you don t fancy walking to Buckingham Palace a cab is less than 10 and the train station is a 5 minute walk away from the hotel Staff are very friendly and allowed us to keep our luggage after check out to save us carrying it around the city with us Will definitely be returning the next time I m in London 
250967,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, Very clean and nice furnished rooms The staff was super friendly and helpful The location was perfect for sightseeing and also for going out at night due to bus stops and underground stations in walking distance Would definitely recommend staying there 
250968,The Belgrave Hotel, Bedroom onto main road so with the window slightly open it was a very noisy especially for a light sleeper Other than that excellent , Lovely hotel Nice room comfortable clean modern The breakfast was excellent A huge choice more than I was expecting Staff were friendly and very helpful I would recommend staying here 
250969,The Belgrave Hotel, The main issue was that we both had a cold shower in January which was very poor and shouldn t happen in a hotel with such high rates Staff seemed off they could smile more and be more helpful although bar man was great , Clean well appointed room in a great location
250970,The Belgrave Hotel, The breakfast was very nice very fresh but surprised you had to pay more for any cooked food , The single room is very compact but very well laid out 
250971,The Belgrave Hotel, Limited space to move around for a couple with small suitcases Even with ac heating off constant noise running through the pipes causing a disturbed night s sleep , Great location close to Pimlico station and restaurants Clean rooms and friendly staff 
250972,The Belgrave Hotel, No heating in the bathroom a very minor issue as once the bedroom was heated it wasn t really noticeable anymore, Lots of amenities supplied in your room Good continental breakfast for the price Nice quiet location very close to the city centre
250973,The Belgrave Hotel, Only downside was that breakfast wasn t included in the price, We loved the room it was gorgeous it was also very roomy and clean The bed was huge and more importantly it was really comfortable We would definitely stay here again
250974,The Belgrave Hotel, We stayed here last year for new year and it was fabulous hence our return for this years celebration Unfortunately it wasn t as good Our first night 30th Dec fire alarm went off at 5 am not one member of staff met us at the stairs Another guest informed us it was a false alarm had it been for real I m not sure we d have been directed safely out of the building We got no apologies for our trauma We stayed another night 31st Dec spent the evening with family and watched the fireworks got back about 2 pm and ready to sleep no chance one of the rooms had a party eventually the noise stopped but resumed at 8 in the morning So we got very little sleep Even though its was new year I would of expected the hotel to ask them very quickly to have some respect for other residents , Near to Westminster and family that live near by 
250975,The Belgrave Hotel, Service could be better no extra towels no bathrobes Room was not clean with broken window and cracked walls No natural light from outside in lower ground floor Heating was off at most of times and was not working at all in bathroom Overpriced 300 a night definitely not 4 hotel max 3 Will never stay there again , Comfortable bed good size TV Nespresso in executive room 
250976,The Belgrave Hotel, bedroom bathroom are compact but clean and well decorated, friendly staff superb continental breakfast clean great location near Victoria Station River Thames can walk to Westminster fridge and Nespresso provided poppy head shower 
250977,The Belgrave Hotel, I think we were just unlucky with the room we were given there were stairs and staff rooms behind us also the room above us sounded like it had wooden floors and we could literally hear everything if the rooms were sound proofed this hotel would be almost perfect , The hotel was absolutely beautiful in a fairly quiet relaxed location with some great restaurants pubs nearby
250978,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, As usual perfect location and very nice room we booked a superior this time Breakfast was excellent and staff very polite and helpful Thank you again 
250979,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, Small room at the ground floor but really comfy hotel is really close to Victoria Station almost 10 min by walk I would definitely recommend this hotel 
250980,The Belgrave Hotel, It is a bit of trek to the places in which I work but well worth it for the size and comfort of the room , Good sized rooms for London with helpful staff 
250981,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, Everything about our stay at the Belgrave Hotel was amazing and there is nothing better than having a great hotel to make your stay in a new country special The cost was great and included free wifi and free breakfast which by the way was SO good The staff is very friendly The location is incredible right next to an underground station and a bus stop and only a quick 20 minutes to get to Central London Everything there is very comfortable and very clean which was so important to me when deciding on a hotel to go with Highly recommend and would definitely book again 
250982,The Belgrave Hotel, Nothing, Excellent the room was fantastic food more than you could wish to eat spotlessly clean every where Staff lovely Manager a lovely man very very helpful This is our third stay at this beautiful hotel will definitely be back again

250984,The Belgrave Hotel, Breakfast was ok but for the price we decided to pick something up elsewhere on the second morning, decent location quiet street with tube station a few minutes walk Bedroom well equipped
250985,The Belgrave Hotel, The heating was probably not working very well and it was rather noisy The strong noise coming from upstairs partly due to the insufficient floor insulation from other guests , Cleanliness decent size single room by London standards location very close to Victoria Train and Coach Stations The continental breakfast was very good and varied including lots of fresh fruit yoghurt and croissants In may case it was included in the room price but otherwise it was very reasonably priced by London standards about GBP 11 for a the self service continental option but if you paid some extra pounds you could have some cooked options 
250986,The Belgrave Hotel, Minor inconveniences Bathroom light switch only by one side of bed Nothing by bathroom door Considering the small room the desk could ve been smaller allowing for easier movement around the room , Cleanliness of room and bathroom capsule machine for a decent in room coffee
250987,The Belgrave Hotel, Nothing, The hotel was super clean breakfast excellent and close to all facilities and things to do in London I really recommand this hotel and will for sure go back
250988,The Belgrave Hotel, After checking in which was nice and swift we went to put our luggage in the room and found the cleaner in it who said she was just checking it we had just seen her in reception The bedcover had a couple of dirty marks on it We Informed reception and it was changed small room and the bathroom was tiny although the shower was a good size we found the sink was over sized so you needed to squeeze your way in to get to the shower and toilet the light switch to the b room was in an odd place and couldt find the switch to use the toilet in the night Banged my Toe once or twice but no harm done , The hotel entrance was nice and open and the breakfast dining area was bright and modern Nice walk in shower very modern room although it was small 101 Staff were polite The Buffet at Breakfast was very nice Area was ok and was good For walking to the attactions which took about 30 45 mins Tube was ok although if you go to Covent Garden to see the shows you need to get 2 Tubes there and back so a bit of a trek But overall not bad 
250989,The Belgrave Hotel, Maybe a second chair in the room though it was no real problem , Friendly but professional staff Decor and ambience excellent Very good breakfast with lots of choice Standard room is on the small side but suited our need for an overnight stay Staff happy to store our luggage during the day until time for our bus Also happy to serve tea in the foyer till time to leave

250996,The Belgrave Hotel, Single rooms adequate but very small especially shower room also very cold as heating not activated until key card inserted Took a while to heat up , Very nice public areas and breakfast room lovely breakfast buffet very friendly and helpful staff Relaxing ambience 
250997,The Belgrave Hotel, the room was so tiny i could hardly move The bathroom sink was over the toilet it was that small OK for one night on business but not for a weekend trip to London , location clean rooms
250998,The Belgrave Hotel, Not much at all Everything was great , From the moment I arrived at the Belgrave I was met with a warm welcome by George Even though I arrived early and my room was not yet ready George graciously took my bags so that I could start my day off exploring this beautiful city He also was exceptionally knowledgeable on the best routes for me to take In addition I found the location to be extremely convenient to the Victoria station coming in from Gatwick airport on the Gatwick express which I highly recommend and a short walk to the Pimlico station from the hotel You can either walk from Victoria station 12 mins or take the Victoria blue line one stop to Pimlico 5 minute walk to the hotel An Uber was about 5 pounds I also recommend Uber getting around as opposed to taxis as they are much more cost effective I found the Belgrave hotel also very walkable to many of the main attractions I was able to walk to Tate Modern and continue up the road to Westminster Abbey House of Parliament and Big Ben to name a few I also was able to get around using the tube which is pretty easy once you get your bearings on the routes The nice thing is there is always someone in the station to direct you This a boutique hotel which is nice change from the big chain hotels I felt as though I was living among the Brits that may also reside along the row of townhouses on Belgrave The hotel is very new and clean The room is a decent size and average for oversees and the bathroom was large and roomy It was stocked with tea and coffee They even give you biscuits and water There was a refrigerator great as their is a wine store around the corner safe full size hairdryer iron and the wi fi was very good Housekeeping did an excellent job at cleaning the room each day They even washed my champagne flute each day for me I don t think you can beat the price either Also I would like to add I m a solo female traveler and I felt extremely safe from walking to and from the tube even in the evenings 
250999,The Belgrave Hotel, Nothing no faults at all, Staff could not be more helpful or friendly the room was excellent little extras like bath robes and slippers plus a helpful little mobile fone you can use that is a trip advisor and guide plus free local rate calls ant internet will definitely stay here on my next visit to London
251000,The Belgrave Hotel, Room slightly small ok for a night or two but no more , Very friendly helpful staff Relatively quiet Clean nice atmosphere close to Victoria Station
251001,The Belgrave Hotel, This was our second visit and this time was disappointed to be given a front room which was noisy from the traffic also early morning we could hear the bins rubbish being put out which woke us, I really enjoyed the choice of the continental breakfast a fab selection of fresh fruit with a lovely tasting yogurt also lovely pastries Very comfortable bed and pillow
251002,The Belgrave Hotel, Room was very noisy especially in the morning as we placed next to thoroughfare even though we had requested a quiet room No compensation was offered , Proximity to London Victoria
251003,The Belgrave Hotel, Noise from guests staying in above room room quite small for an executive suite, Good location easy getting to sights breakfast was ok could of had a few hot dishes as you get these on the continent 
251004,The Belgrave Hotel, Personal choice the pillows weren t great for me , Close enough to Underground and Coach station Fantastic room with great view and good space High levels of cleanliness Excellent continental breakfast buffet as lots of variety of bread pastries jam etc Friendly and helpful staff 
251005,The Belgrave Hotel, Nothing not to like, We love this hotel The location in Pimlico is perfect We had a top floor room from which we had a view of the London Eye Very quiet room nicely appointed 
251006,The Belgrave Hotel, Nothing to dislike , The location is great for arriving and leaving London from Victoria station 2 minute walk to Pimlico tube station Service is friendly and efficient rooms are comfortable with all of the usual facilities Breakfast is excellent 
251007,The Belgrave Hotel, Hospitality WHAT A JOKE The location and rooms maybe ok but I ve never been treated so badly in my life I checked into the belgrave in Pimlico on Saturday afternoon after paying upfront for my room and as customary swiped my credit card on arrival to cover any additional costs that may be incurred That evening my wife and I went into the west end and unfortunately had our bag containing all of our cash credit and debit cards car keys and mobile phone stolen We were devastated Our devastation never ended there In the morning we went down to reception and explained what had happened and asked if the hotel could possibly help us out and charge my credit card which had already been swiped for 50 00 and refund us 50 00 in cash in order to give us enough money to make our way home We were informed that this was not possible as anything charged to a room has to be accounted for by the sale of a product I asked if I could then have 50 00 paid into their bank account and if they could then give me the 50 00 in cash as I was completely stranded This suggestion was met with a complete and absolute NO I asked if there were any staff member including the indifferent receptionist and duty manager who we were trying to explain our predicament to if they would be prepared to help us out They both treated us as though we were tramps walking off the street asking for some change for our next bottle of cider not like paying guests who had just been robbed and still traumatised At no point did any staff member offer any form of sympathy or help but rather treated us with complete disdain and contempt We checked out of this hotel without having breakfast or even a cup of tea as I was not prepared to give these disgusting people another penny of my money I have never been made to feel so cheap or bad in my life THE STAFF AND MANAGEMENT OF THIS HOTEL ARE A DISGRACE TO THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY ,No Positive
251008,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, I am passing on that our Trustee who used this hotel was very happy with his stay My details are for contact as I made the booking but I wasn t the hotel guest myself
251009,The Belgrave Hotel, Very small rooms No cupboards available in the rooms to put the clothes in nor any place space to put the luggage on since the clothes had to stay in the luggage , Location and the cleanness
251010,The Belgrave Hotel, Rooms are small but the location and amenities make up for it , Our Executive room contained many well thought out amenities built in European socket smart phone that could be used outside of the hotel very useful for maps etc 
251011,The Belgrave Hotel, The only thing I didn t like were laminated floor in the rooms as you could hear when anyone moved so if they were up early so were you, Pleasant staff and modern hotel
251012,The Belgrave Hotel, Rooms are quite small We could hear noises TV phone ringing form the room next to us, Locations is great all major tourists sights are in walking distance great availability of underground and bus Breakfast was very delicious The best thing is the smartphone in the room with internet and free calls you can take with you to the city You can leave bags and luggage after checkout and pick it up later for free
251013,The Belgrave Hotel, Only downside was the noise from the room above They could maybe do with a little more insulation between rooms, Lovely room well decorated and nicely finished 
251014,The Belgrave Hotel, It was clean But could be and needa to be cleaner Thank God for the slippers provided because the floors are filthy and covered the bottom of the slipper with lots of fluff and hair and dirt The sheets smelt a bit fausty Also the cleaner never replaced or cleaned the glasses that were provided in the room All the do they do is make the bed needs to dust A LOT , Has the wow factor when you first walk in Nice and modern Everything was really nice and I would go back and recommend 
251015,The Belgrave Hotel, We reported the socket for the kettle had stopped working a member of staff came to look at it and said someone would come to fix it later that day but no one turned up It was still not working when we checked out , The choice at breakfast was very good and the coffee was excellent 
251016,The Belgrave Hotel, Hair drier unable to use as there was no electrical extension due to the position of the mirror in the room far away from the electrical point Hotel could not help , Location in London for Victoria rail station an excellent breakfast 
251017,The Belgrave Hotel, If I could include a foto it would show u how unbelievably tiny the so called bathroom was in fact I burnt my backside trying 2 get past the towel heater 2 get 2 the toilet Then 2 get in2 the shower so small my 11 yr old grandson wouldn t b able 2 get in there, The bed breakfasts were good The staff was great
251018,The Belgrave Hotel, Would be nice if the rooms were bigger , Staff were welcoming and polite Room was small but cleverly designed to have everything and keep space Continental breakfast was delicious and there was plenty on offer 
251019,The Belgrave Hotel, 1 At the day before check out day all the TV channels excluding BBC channels were disconnected The staff ve explained that it has to be purchased 2 Pure noise isolation you can hear all movings of neighbors above 3 Each morning at 5 30 am there is unloading truck works under your window It awakes 4 One day there was no hot water in a bathroom just warm ,No Positive
251020,The Belgrave Hotel, The standard rooms are too small for an extended stay The hotel should make prospective clients aware of larger room choices during booking , Excellent continental breakfast trendy decor and pleasant friendly staff 
251021,The Belgrave Hotel, The staff didn t seem very happy on arrival and departure on the reception desk , Beautiful hotel clean and well maintained Lovely rooms with beautiful bathrooms shower was fantastic Easy access walking from the tube station A lovely overnight retreat 
251022,The Belgrave Hotel, Coffee machine at breakfast didn t work the whole week, The staff were great and helped a lot It is a nice boutique hotel very close to the Pimlico tube station so you are accessible to all you need and in very quiet and nice neighborhood
251023,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, The location was great only a short walk from the Pimlico station It was only a short walk to a variety of restaurants The breakfast buffet was good with a mix of both hot and cold foods 
251024,The Belgrave Hotel, A small niggle but the duvet cover and pillowslips were of a coarse cotton which did not fit the bed and stayed creased , Excellent position for transport links around central London good choice of restaurants within a short walk Immaculate boutique hotel in calm part of beautiful Pimlico Good choice at breakfast buffet Very well equipped rooms Lots of considerate extras Friendly Well trained staff Will stay at the Belgrave on our next London trip
251025,The Belgrave Hotel, Room size We stayed at this hotel in February had a lovely room this time it was the size of a shoe box no fridge nowhere to hang any clothes Our son who was with us and alone had a massive room on the lower floor don t understand the criteria for room assignment , Nice breakfast good location friendly staff 
251026,The Belgrave Hotel, Stairs a bit creaky and only one small lift Pillows a bit soft People should be aware of additional cost for cooked breakfast , Great continental breakfast was included and set us up well for the day Love the phone tablet that comes with the room Very clean and close to Pimlico station Pleased with choice 
251027,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, Great location close to bus stop victoria or pimlico stations restaurants and laundrette Our executive suite came with a handy mobile device that we could use for free around london this was great while we sorted out sim cards and we were impressed that a hotel would offer a smartphone for their guests 
251028,The Belgrave Hotel, The room was very small even for a solo traveller , The cleanliness was to such a high standard that I questioned whether I was the first person to ever use the room Staff were attentive and the location was convenient for Victoria station 
251029,The Belgrave Hotel, Everything was great, This place should be kept secret it is a rare find in London where hotels are usually either overpriced or dodgy or most likely both This place is clean has nice decor in a good location And those little touches as the choc waiting for you make it perfect 
251030,The Belgrave Hotel, We would stay at the Belgrave if we visit London in the future The only drawback was that we were on a half floor meaning that there were stairs to negotiate to get to the floor with elevator , The continental breakfast which was included was great All employees were professional and helpful AC was invaluable during our stay because it was surprisingly warm and humid in London We loved that the pass card to our room also operated the lighting Everything was as described The location couldn t have been better Everything is upgraded and modern in this hotel 
251031,The Belgrave Hotel, We found the bedroom small as we were travelling from Australia and had a bit of luggage with us, Staff was very friendly and made you feel very welcome always happy to assist you with anything we asked Fantastic location close to trains and restaurants
251032,The Belgrave Hotel, We had a couple of issues like paying for a king and being assured our room had a king but really having a queen I don t think they have traditional kings and something was lost in translation there The AC isn t very powerful we set it to 16c and it would say it was 16 but there was no way I asked for a fan or something and they told me to try opening the window since it was cool unfortunately the window wouldn t open The biggest issue was that there was a very foul smell in our bathroom The staff was nice I asked for some freshener to spray and they apologized Came back from dinner and it was worse Asked for a different room and was given a room that was drastically smaller and on the below street level so we opted to stay in our room and deal with it after buying room spray at Tesco By the 3rd night it was much better but it was unfortunate again staff was lovely and tried to help the room they had just wasn t what we paid for so we opted for some extra room , Check in was very easy I really loved the location Beautiful lobby lovely staff I needed to communicate with them prior to our stay and the response was prompt and courteous 
251033,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, Our room was lovely the shower was massive and powerful My boyfriend really liked the coffee pods provided and the continental breakfast is delicious It is only a 5 min walk from Victoria making it super convenient They let us check in early as our room was ready and looked after our bags the day we checked out until we left London Would happily stay again 
251034,The Belgrave Hotel, Very small room at first but was then replaced with a better one Very expensive hotel for the room size Breakfast was nice but its a shame that you need to pay extra for cooked eggs , Clean equipted with everything you need Free water bottles very nice staff Great quiet nighbourhood 
251035,The Belgrave Hotel, No mirrors near a plug socket not good when trying to dry or straighten hair When we went down for breakfast we were automatically charged for the continental breakfast but once we were given the menu they had other options we only wanted a small breakfast of scrambled eggs on toast which was 5 90 yet we had been charged 11 90 for the continental and the 5 90 would of been on top of this Once we explained we only wanted the scrambled eggs the other was refunded and the breakfast was amended this option also included hot drinks , Very quiet location only 10mins from attractions transports links Read reviews saying the rooms were small but we found the oom a decent size which were very clean and tidy no wardrobe space but for a few days did not cause us any issue maybe a longer stay or a family this may cause concern breakfast was nice once a issue was resolved 
251036,The Belgrave Hotel, Room was a bit small Not much room around the bed Had a wardrobe but no dresser , Great location and very well maintained Very close to a few good restaurants pubs and coffee shops Short walk to the Underground 
251037,The Belgrave Hotel, The other room we booked was extremely cramped The staircase is steep and narrow When we arrived and pulled the covers off the bed we found two tics in the bed , One of the rooms we stayed in was spacious
251038,The Belgrave Hotel, Nothing, Location excellent close to underground some good pubs and eateries nearby Room a tad small but comfy bed and excellent shower Tea coffee facilities provided all in all excellent stay would highly recommend 
251039,The Belgrave Hotel, Too small bathroom tiny had to get dried in room, Very small room stayed for 4days no wardrobe at all no drawers next to lift and cleaning cupboard room 405 should only be used for anyone staying one night with not much luggage very disappointed the room
251040,The Belgrave Hotel, Room and bathroom a bit on the small size with uninspiring view try to get a street facing room Rainforest shower would have been nice but couldn t use it due to it spraying water over the top of the shower screen , Location worked well for us being near to Victoria station yet a reasonable walking distance to Westminster South Bank etc Pimlico is nearest tube station maybe 5 minutes walk Smart looking interior good use of space in the lobby small bar and three small lounge areas Friendly staff no problem storing luggage either if arriving early or leaving late 
251041,The Belgrave Hotel, When asked whether we could have a 12 00 check out the answer was a very curt No without even checking arrival times or occupanc Earliest check in is at 15 00 so surely one hour s grace period for one room cannot hurt their operations mcan it , Plenty of choice for a continental breakfast and room 108 was quite spacious even w a balcony
251042,The Belgrave Hotel, Rooms a bit small, Welcoming and helpful staff great sieatin spaces around reception which is unusual for such hotels We were able to sit and chat with friends Nice breakfast
251043,The Belgrave Hotel, The double room was slightly small but met our needs very clean and comfortable , The staff were very helpful and the hotel was extremely clean and a good location to main tourist sites 
251044,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, Best continental breakfast I ve had in my life and there was even a Nespresso machine in our room Combining jetlag with a long day of exploring those creature comforts are really what made our stay so enjoyable overall 
251045,The Belgrave Hotel, The room and bathroom were very small not enough room to swing a gerbil , Good location for our visit to Westminster Abbey The breakfast was excellent 
251046,The Belgrave Hotel, Breakfast ham cheese not to our taste but that s just personal preference Bedroom floor quite dusty and some dust on bathroom fixtures but not a deal breaker, Lovely airy hotel modern welcoming My request for a quiet room was fulfilled which made me very happy Fantastic shower Everything just right for our needs 
251047,The Belgrave Hotel, We were robbed in the hotel and nothing was done It was missing some presents that we bought from the inside the room More or less US 65 I traveled a lot around the world and was the very fisrt time that I was robbed in the hotel I stil wait for the manager to solve the problem This was 2 weeks ago and nothing till now There was no place to put the luggages The room was too small the bad inclusive and the bathroom too big ,No Positive

251052,The Belgrave Hotel, Queue for coffee machine at breakfast was slow, Very clean with modern decor polite staff Executive room was very spacious with excellent TV and the shower was great 
251053,The Belgrave Hotel, I thought the staff could have been more helpful I called reception on 3 separate occasions and they didn t answer my calls Also the front desk messed up the taxi service and gave them the wrong location even though I confirmed with them twice Kinda annoying , The hotel is in a great location and all of the tourist sightseeing sites in London are a 10 15 min walk I walked everywhere during my stay and really enjoyed it The rooms are very comfortable compact and clean The complimentary continental breakfast is delicious Check out CASK which is a really cute local pub by the hotel Great burgers and drinks Will definitely stay at this hotel for my next stay 
251054,The Belgrave Hotel, Nothing liked it all , The bed was large and comfortable room was modern and well decorated our signature room had a complimentary minibar breakfast was good quality 
251055,The Belgrave Hotel, Can t think of anything It suited us perfectly , Our ground floor room was lovely with quality furnishings and nice touches ie comfy slippers nespresso coffee maker as well as tea coffee facilities Nice bathroom had 2 shower options with a rainfall and conventional shower head Located at the quieter end of Belgravia and easy reach of Pimlico tube station Victoria station bus stops Easy walk to the magnificent Tate gallery Would use again 
251056,The Belgrave Hotel, The guests in the room above were a bit noisy in the night, We like the lovely rooms and comfortable beds The friendly staff and the close proximity to all attractions This has been our third visit 
251057,The Belgrave Hotel, The sign outside was very small so taxi struggled to find it Water pressure in the shower was not great Overall these are the only things I could find lacking , The rooms were not huge but well laid out I loved the small touches chilled waters slippers Check in and check out was very efficient and the staff very friendly 
251058,The Belgrave Hotel, There wasn t anything we didn t like, The staff were lovely nothing was too much trouble and the hotel was spotless and the food lovely with plenty of choice

251061,The Belgrave Hotel, Room a bit small and breakfast a bit chaotic when the restaurant was full another coffee machine would help, Decor location very friendly and helpful staff Never stayed in the Pimlico area before and was pleasantly surprised because of the good weather we were able to walk to a lot of places 
251062,The Belgrave Hotel, The rooms are on the small side Quite a way off the tourist and shopping areas , Loved the inclusive breakfast Great way to start the day Very friendly and helpful staff Within walking distance to some good restaurants near the Victoria Station 
251063,The Belgrave Hotel, WiFi didn t work You can open a window only for 10 cm some kind of security so we have been under air conditioner Really didn t like that Very expensive if you want to eat english breakfast which is not included in the price , Very good location 10 min walk to Victoria station Nice neighborhood Staff was ok Nice looking room 
251064,The Belgrave Hotel, Rooms were terribly small Much smaller than the pictures showed , I loved that they had breakfast every morning the room was cleaned and they left coffee and fresh biscuits each day The bathroom was large and looked new with a great shower 
251065,The Belgrave Hotel, There wasn t a single thing I disliked , Great service Gave me an early checkin which saved my life after a long haul flight Room was so modern and clean and 5 minutes walk from Victoria station

251068,The Belgrave Hotel, I felt the bedroom and especially the bathroom were very claustrophobic The room consequently was over warm and I found it difficult to sleep , Attractive lobby and breakfast room The food offered was very good 
251069,The Belgrave Hotel, For us no negatives , The staff were very friendly yet professional and went the extra mile eg surprise gift in our room to acknowledge a special birthday for my wife Secondly to be treated as individuals Special thanks to Athena for being professional yet sharing her bubbly personality 
251070,The Belgrave Hotel, Room is kind of small No lunch or dinner offered , Good location close to the Victoria line There is a deli across the street Free bottle water in the fridge

251072,The Belgrave Hotel, Bedroom on small side okay for short stay , The hotel was very modern and stylish especially breakfast room and reception Excellent staff and location Breakfast was very good 
251073,The Belgrave Hotel, I have nothing bad to write If I had to say something I guess it would be the room was on the small side , We arrived early once it was cleaned they let us check in early Also left a bottle of wine card for my husbands birthday 
251074,The Belgrave Hotel, I stayed in x2 different rooms One was excellent however the basement room needs some serious sound proofing I was kept awake by the upstairs neighbours for hours Such a shame as the hotel is fab , The staff They were super helpful 
251075,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, Breakfast was fabulous The room was small but very comfortable the bed was fantastic Did I already mention that breakfast was fabulous It was indeed 
251076,The Belgrave Hotel, I ve been alocated room in the basement despite paying for a Executive Room My first room was smelling of damp and wall paper was all bubbling It was nothing like advertised on the site Staff upon my complaint was obnoxious and the only thing were capable to do was rolling their eyes Upon check out the woman behind the reception didn t even wanted to address the issue and dismissed me like a piece of Unacceptable , Very clean 
251077,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, Hotel in a great location close to pimlico and Victoria tube station staff were excellent breakfast was great rooms small but spotless We would definitely stay again

251079,The Belgrave Hotel, The room was a bit small for two but I understand that most London rooms are small , The room was well equipped and the location was excellent We really enjoyed the buffet breakfast each morning 
251080,The Belgrave Hotel, Nothing to add, The hotel was near to where I was attending a conference A few restaurants were within walking distance which was good after a long day The hotel was very clean and the staff were extremely welcoming and helpful The room was a decent size for a single and very comfy bed Check in and out was quick 
251081,The Belgrave Hotel, Front desk staff could have been more welcoming helpful The desk attendant watched us struggle with multiple heavy bags through the door after arriving late at night from a long flight , Excellent breakfasts good staff particularly in the dining area Room small as clearly stated but clean and comfortable Bathroom surprisingly large Great location walking distance to almost everything a tourist would want to see

251086,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, Very clean and comfortable hotel within ready walking distance of Victoria Station and popular visitor spots like Tate Britain and Westminster Abbey Fantastic continental breakfast selection with plenty of choices 
251087,The Belgrave Hotel, We have been charged twice both on the date of our arrival being 07 07 16 for 2 nights We paid 306 cash as soon as we arrived to the receptionist by the name of Valentina She was seeking directions from her colleague at the time so we assume she was relatively new I can t recall her issuing a receipt for the cash We always pay cash because we have a Travel Card We were asked to give details of our credit card as well Our credit card has been debited with the Australian equivalent of 306 as well Any assistance to recover this over payment immediately would be greatly appreciated , Andre provided us with excellent service from the breakfast bar He provided us with a takeaway breakfast because of a 6am departure on 9th July Abdul the night receptionist was very helpful would have given top rating for staff if we hadn t been charged twice 
251088,The Belgrave Hotel, The wooden floors in the guest rooms mean that it is quite noisy hearing other guests walking about on other floors which kept me awake until it subsided , The staff were very friendly and the rooms were nicely presented including nice touches like the coffee machine The continental breakfast was nice 
251089,The Belgrave Hotel, Perhaps one of the physically smallest spaces I can remember staying in in a while Navigating the room by more than one person is a real challenge and neither I nor my partner are large people Although in the pictures they look remarkably modern some of the furniture in the room is in fact rather harried and somewhat dated , Nice spot fairly well located certain aesthetic touches were nice more or less calm environment air conditioning was strong and effective desk staff were friendly and accommodating 
251090,The Belgrave Hotel, Did not like ensuite Far too small with no room to wash face properly due to shelf above sink and tap design No room to dry oneself after shower and no room for own toiletries Room itself clean but compact with no place to rest suitcases except the bed Fine for 1 night but would have reservations if staying more than 1 night Plus no HD channels , The continental breakfast was lovely The bed was comfortable The staff very friendly and welcoming Nice quiet location only a short walk from travel connections 
251091,The Belgrave Hotel, Noisy especially at night with other guests using the lift and the doors shutting with a bang Rooms were quite cramped with hardly any space to move once you opened the suitcase , Decent location good breakfast 
251092,The Belgrave Hotel, All I can think of is the size of the room for the first 6 nights Would have liked it a bit bigger so we could move comfortably round the bed , The breakfasts were great good value especially as they were included in the price Our room was quite small but comfy and very clean We then stayed an extra 2 nights after a trip to Europe and booked a Junior Suite Lovely views of the city from that room and of course a lot bigger 
251093,The Belgrave Hotel, very small room not very friendly staff in the lobby one person the rest was fine Hard to contact the hotel by e mail Too expensive but I think that just London is , clean nice bedroom every day new washing set quiet room nice view neighbourhood close to victoria station and underground very good continental breakfast staff during breakfast very friendly 
251094,The Belgrave Hotel, Room was a bit small but me and my friend are very small people so it didn t matter that much , Had a fabulous stay Bed very comfortable and breakfast was very tasty Very close to the station and amazing value for money My friend and I have already planned to book again for October 
251095,The Belgrave Hotel, Nothing, Room was a bit small but very clean staff were lovely 10 minute walk from Victoria central station but tube station a few minutes away Would definitely book again 
251096,The Belgrave Hotel, The only think that I would have liked would be a bath , The rooms are very modern and very clean The hotel has a very pretty and romantic feel to it Was unique and cute Didn t have the chain hotel feel to it which I like The most comfy bed 
251097,The Belgrave Hotel, Pillows too hard Bathroom sink not practical hard to access , Very nice boutique hotel Good location and tasteful design Cosy although small rooms as often in London Comfortable bed Backyard room which was very calm 
251098,The Belgrave Hotel, Bed had quite a dent in one side but overall comfort was not too bad, Friendly staff clean everything I needed was provided including toiletries being topped up as used and the continental buffet breakfast was fantastic with an amazing range of quality food Would highly recommend this lovely hotel in a wonderful location
251099,The Belgrave Hotel, I think that hotel would benefit from offering an evening dining experience, This hotel was a great location the underground was just the end of the Road and there was some very good restaurants with in a few minutes walk
251100,The Belgrave Hotel, Room next to stairs which was a bit noisy with the door banging although we were relatively early to bed with an early start next day , Extremely clean room Welcoming staff Easy to leave luggage after checking out which was convenient Very well placed for the tube and victoria coach or train station Breakfast from 6 30 good for early start and continental had plenty of choice 
251101,The Belgrave Hotel, I found the bed and pillows a bit hard for my liking but everyone s preferences are different , food was lovely good location for tube restaurants ect staff were absolutely amazing cannot fault them went out of their way to help stunning reception area and everything was very clean 
251102,The Belgrave Hotel, Very small quirky room but it did have a view over rooftops and a window that opened wide , Great location especially after we discovered the 24 bus Lovely staff 
251103,The Belgrave Hotel, The hotel was extremely hot Our air con in our room wouldnt work from the terminal in the room so we had to get reception to put it on it then worked which was brilliant but a pain to keep asking reception to put it on for us , The staff were fantastic and so friendly 
251104,The Belgrave Hotel, a matchbox of a room The shower door leaked The hairdryer was broken and after two telephone requests l had to go to reception who said it was the first they had heard of it An apology would have helped On the other hand the breakfasts were excellent ,No Positive

251110,The Belgrave Hotel, Breakfast room staff spent a lot of time talking and joking between themselves not really serving customers , Reception Staff were friendly Wifi worked well throughout and view of London from 5th floor is pretty awesome Room was clean and AC worked 
251111,The Belgrave Hotel, I actually found it a little hard to find from Victoria as its out the back way There were building works which meant I could go where the sat nav was saying But got there in the end , The room was really lovely and all the staff I met were really friendly and helpful A really special place 
251112,The Belgrave Hotel, everything was amazing apart from no hotel restaurant But what a fabulous spot , It was just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Vitoria but close enough that you re never to far from the real London streets The hotel does not do food but with French restaurant Grumbles is just round the corner and take my word for it the food and wine is to die for 
251113,The Belgrave Hotel, Rooms a bit small so not for long periods but just fine for a short visit , Great central location but still quiet Staff very friendly Close to Tube station few minutes walk Clean 
251114,The Belgrave Hotel, There is one little thing there is no isolation between the rooms so you can here same noise from other rooms Small thing definitely not a deal breaker , Location was perfect just 10 minutes walk from Victoria station and 5 minutes walk from pimlico station Staff was so nice and helpful with every single question Breakfast was good and the room was clean
251115,The Belgrave Hotel, Cigarette smoking member of staff who told me to wait at the bar while he finished his cigarette, Poor interaction from the staff front desk staff had been the only members available When ordering a drink from the bar the staff member who was at the front door told me to wait while he finished his cigarette 
251116,The Belgrave Hotel, Didn t find out till leaving that my daughter and I could of had twin beds instead of sharing a double bed, Very pleasant environment Have stayed at other hotel near by and found this 1 is the best 
251117,The Belgrave Hotel, Could do with a bit more space around breakfast serving area especially coffee machine separate milk jug for cereal, Good selection at breakfast small charge for upgrade to full English
251118,The Belgrave Hotel, Room could have been a little larger particularly the bathroom which was very compact , Everything about the hotel was lovely staff room cleanliness and location was brilliant
251119,The Belgrave Hotel, Nothing to dislike, Outstanding staff was always there to answer any questions Excellent breakfast with spacious dining room The items for breakfast were constantly replenished and fresh The room was clean and the bed was comfortable Excellent location within walking distance of the Victoria Coach Station and Pimlico tube Station This hotel is at a great location and we felt safe walking to the many restaurants in the area We had the executive double room with a balcony and enjoyed sitting out there and watching the sites on this lovely road 
251120,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, My room was very beautiful It included a chaise lounge I slept for 14 hours It was a remarkable experience Like being taken care of by angels or faeries or poetry 
251121,The Belgrave Hotel, Bathroom was fine but could have more space to put toiletries cosmetics etc Other than one hook no bars for towels Reception staff could be more knowledgeable about the city and restaurants in the area , Continental breakfast was very good and staff was excellent Rooms recently renovated and quite comfortable Very good restaurants nearby Within 15 minutes walking time to Victoria Station Reception staff helpful 
251122,The Belgrave Hotel, The rooms are a little on the compact side but it is a historic building so worth it still , Hotel is lovely Service is amazing too Really worth a visit A hidden gem really close to Victoria station Our room on floor 5 had a skyline view of the London Eye and Big Ben 
251123,The Belgrave Hotel, Bathroom very small Shelf over very small sink which u could not even clean your teeth properly at Toiletries had been emptied and boxes left on shelf ,No Positive
251124,The Belgrave Hotel, I think 11 for the continental and 14 for the full English breakfast is a bit steep and I would not bother if bought separately The deal we had included breakfast and so overall was good value for such a location between Victoria and Pimlico stations , Modern feel within a traditional Georgian town house Helpful staff Comfortable and quiet room Good breakfast if part of the room rate 
251125,The Belgrave Hotel, Pillows a bit hard but staff changed them and gave us extra ones immediately , Wonderful continental breakfast with cooked options at only a little extra charge Friendly staff 
251126,The Belgrave Hotel, The queen sized bed sagged a bit on the side that is apparently most often used and the carpet was stained The room was quite small but we managed to accommodate our luggage by rearranging chairs , The No 24 bus runs directly between Trafalgar Square and Belgrave Road Also the bathroom was quite stylish with a good shower once we figured it out 
251127,The Belgrave Hotel, Small room breakfast was a little boring and to small for the size of the hotel , Nice stuff very clean room good breakfast but could be better for the money not a lot of different choices

251129,The Belgrave Hotel, Wifi connection poor , Staff were amazing anything we wanted they facilitated us with Had a fabulous 4 night stay Only a short walk to Victoria station which was extremely handy 
251130,The Belgrave Hotel, Housekeeping could have been better Bed mattress was well used and uncomfortable and should have been replaced There is little variety and little choice for breakfast although it is possible to order full English breakfast for an additional four pounds We had expected that they remembered our room number after five mornings but it was obviously too much to ask We had expected to get more value for money We paid after all 125 pounds per night , Staff at reception and breakfast room is helpful and attentive It s quiet and peaceful at the hotel but badly soundproofed between floors The wireless internet worked fine The hotel is close to Tate Britain and subways with few stops to all major sights There are not so many restaurants nearby but try the pub White Swan or the Indian restaurant Millbank Spice in Vauxhall Bridge Road which has great food and service The hotel serves breakfast only 
251131,The Belgrave Hotel, Mixed some very helpful other short and condescending, Nice quiet area safe to walk with lots of eating options including market within 5 min walk Easy walk to major transportation center
251132,The Belgrave Hotel, I went for the luxury room and the view was out to a brick wall , Location was great and the bed was very comfortable They had left a bottle of wine in the room as it was my wife s birthday which was a nice touch
251133,The Belgrave Hotel, N a, We loved everything about this hotel great value for money for London close by all attractions comfy bed and lovely breakfast had read comments about people complaining about the room size so was expecting a teeny room and we were surprised at the size we didn t consider it that small and who goes on holiday to stay in your room 
251134,The Belgrave Hotel, Limited hanging space in the standard room not a problem for us this time but no doubt an upgraded room would have more space Young dark haired lady on reception on arrival could have been more welcoming and engaging , Great location spotlessly clean very comfortable bed and immaculate bathroom Very good continental breakfast lovely choices and all fresh Really pleasant welcome and great manner from George on Reception 
251135,The Belgrave Hotel, Only one complaint the cleaning staff need to be taught to knock on your door before entering your room in a morning , Location great for all transport links staff friendly overall a very pleasant stay 
251136,The Belgrave Hotel, Room very small Lack of hanging space and drawers Plenty of empty wall space where clothes hanging space could be utilised This is not a complaint just an observation , Staff were polite and very helpful The hotel in general was excellent due to the professionalism of the staff 
251137,The Belgrave Hotel, Our room was right next to the lift and the room was quite cramped especially the bathroom , Room was very bijou and ideal for an overnight stay The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean

251144,The Belgrave Hotel, It would be great to have two singel beds And maybe offer afternoon Tea , The Belgrave is the best hotel I have visit so far in London It is clean and fresh The staff is very helpfull and nice The breakfast is very good with lots of fresh fruits and healthy options The location is excellent in a nice and quiet neighbourhood close to underground and there is some good restaurants close by My sister and I was soo pleased and We will return for London next spring and We will make sure to book at the Belgrave 
251145,The Belgrave Hotel, I really hate to say anything bad about this hotel but unfortunately there is one thing The soundproofing in the floors ceilings is not very good at all so if the person in the room above you walks across the floor it is very noisy A real shame as everything else is wonderful but not recommended for light sleepers , This is an excellent little hotel Very modern and newly fitted rooms spotlessly clean fantastically helpful and friendly staff and a very good breakfast spread cooked breakfasts are a small supplement Difficult to believe it is so good when it is cheaper than some hotels in the area which are much worse 
251146,The Belgrave Hotel, The room was a bit small but as everything else was perfect it was a small price to pay , The room and en suite was clean and well maintained The staff were polite and very helpful The continental breakfast was more than enough for us The free wifi was a bonus We would definitely book this hotel again for a weekend break in London 
251147,The Belgrave Hotel, To say the room was small would be a large understatement The bathroom was so small it was difficult to use the toilet and to get a shower And I m not a big person Had requested an early check in since we had flown overnight Not only were we denied but they wouldn t budge even an hour earlier Checking is 2 and that s that There were lots of people checking out when we got there so I m sure they could have cleaned one of those rooms for us We also said we would be willing to pay more but NO , Great selection at the continental breakfast 
251148,The Belgrave Hotel, Hotel messed up booking in took payment prior to arrival on a pay on arrival booking Was sorted after several emails , Location is excellent to get around London Clean friendly and VFM 
251149,The Belgrave Hotel, The only negative was not a single draw to allow you to unpack anything might be ok if you are a business traveller but not for holiday, Staff breakfast location were great
251150,The Belgrave Hotel, I found the steps to the entrance of the hotel difficult Perhaps a hand rail would help , All very good My room was in very good order and the bathroom met all my needs and more for my mobility problems 
251151,The Belgrave Hotel, I have no complaints what so ever for this hotel , Everything from the room to the Staff was excellent I only stayed one night for the AvN rugby game but I will be booking this hotel again next year possibly for 2 night The continental breakfast was excellent also 
251152,The Belgrave Hotel, The room had no view to speak of The window looked out onto a small flat roof and brick wall , Lovely hotel friendly staff and in a nice central location but away from the hustle and bustle Enjoyed breakfast and the bar was excellent Our room 107 was away from the main corridor down some stairs and was really quiet 
251153,The Belgrave Hotel, Our room was a tiny bit small them city hotels usually are our travelling companions room was bigger so would ask for a bigger one next time not really a complaint though , Lovely decor very sparkly spotlessly clean and staff were helpful Continental breakfast excellent plentifull enough to keep you going all day and could take something away for a snack later will definitely go back to this hotel

251157,The Belgrave Hotel, Another coffee tea machine toaster would be handy Mirror above sockets in bedroom room 410 , The Belgrave is a lovely Hotel enjoyed our stay here Really enjoyed the continental breakfast however there was always a queue for the toaster coffee tea machine Bedroom was lovely but could have done with another mirror especially above the sockets so I could see when using the hairdryer Room 410 
251158,The Belgrave Hotel, Pillows were a little hard I guess that s my own preference , The bed was big and comfortable Food was lovely and very clean throughout Great location 
251159,The Belgrave Hotel, The name on the building could be a bit easier to read Could only be read if you were standing directly in front of it , Friendly happy staff Nice room Good breakfast 
251160,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, The room was big enough because in London you shouldn t expect the big rooms if you only take a standard room The breakfast was superb yoghurt variety of fresh fruit bread pasteries The staff was very friendly We had 4 dinners within 5 minutes walk max 400 meter from the hotel and they were all great and with good price cool extras like newspapers and magazines wifi 
251161,The Belgrave Hotel, The rooms were on the small side but very well equipped and beautifully decorated so it wasn t a dislike as such , Great location few minutes walk from Victoria station and some excellent pubs on the doorstep Hotel modern clean and friendly staff with a lovely continental breakfast Would definitely recommend and return to this hotel

251163,The Belgrave Hotel, Great breakfast just get there before the vultures arrive , Comfy bed warm room and once you have worked out that the key card does everything with a little help from a call to reception 
251164,The Belgrave Hotel, The bed was on the small side only a double Apart from that I couldn t fault the hotel one bit , Hotel was bright and vibrant staff were attentive engaging and friendly Decor was superb and the food was satisfactory The room was small but clean and well presented with everything one could need for such a stay 
251165,The Belgrave Hotel, Our room was 105 which was right next door to the lift was woken a few times in the night when it was being used So wouldn t recommend that room the view wasn t great but only there one night , The hotel decor was very good the continental breakfast had lots of choice
251166,The Belgrave Hotel, The room was freezing and took a while to heat up The heating would also switch off on its own during the night so just as the room would warm up it would get cold again quickly , Breakfast was lovely 
251167,The Belgrave Hotel, Little bit far from the city center Rooms are very small, This otel has a luxury design and rooms are very clean and confortable Near to main train station 
251168,The Belgrave Hotel, Room was a liitle small 007 as was the shower cubicle and the laminate floor in the room above transmitted and amplified every little and large sound , Staff very helpful and pleasant Excellent selection for breakfast constantly replenished so never anything unavailable 
251169,The Belgrave Hotel, Although we got an upgrade from a standard to an exectuive room the room itself was rather small bathroom surprisingly spacious There is a minibar installed in the wardrobe that makes it impossibe to hang any clothes although there were like 6 hanger We stayed on the first floor facing Belgrave Road The road is quite busy and opening the window is not really an option The building structure seems to be a weak spot overall We heard all sorts of noise from other guests Common problem in the UK but not very enjoyable When we went for breakfast at 9 15 the room was full and we had to sit upstairs next to the reception More convenient than the very busy room downstairs but with guests checking out close by and its a rather long way to the buffet We left a bag in the bathroom when we left and phoned the hotel two hours later The room had not been cleaned at that point and we were supposed to be called back after the item was retrieved but nothing happened When we got back to the hotel the reception staff was not aware of our problem At least they joined the houskeeping in searching the rubbish for our bag that was eventually found there Not the perfect way of handling it In sum the hotel is quite ok but it is not a hidden treasure , Good location to Victoria Station and Pimlico Room appeared to be newly refurbished bathroom was well equipped and spacious shower had pleasant water pressure Breakfast selection was ok nothing special though 
251170,The Belgrave Hotel, Sharp hard plastic transparent fire exit signs that hang from the ceiling Cut my head immediately on arrival , Very good breakfast included in the price Nicely decorated clean spacious room 
251171,The Belgrave Hotel, Everything was fine or excellent , Very new hotel location was quite centric breakfast was good and the price is very reasonable The personel was excepcionally kind and helpful So I would strongly advise for a tourism trip to London 
251172,The Belgrave Hotel, Not enough choice of beers snacks in the bar Noise of people walking on wooden floors in room above and doors banging early morning , Late breakfast at weekend Bus stops outside hotel to all tourist areas also only short walk to tube rail stations Friendly helpful staff Plenty of eating places nearby In a quiet area 
251173,The Belgrave Hotel, Room was a tiny bit small but we were traveling light , Room was small but very comfortable Breakfast was included and was very good I loved the automatic coffee machine 
251174,The Belgrave Hotel, There was a little walk from Victoria Station thought it was a bit closer No wardrobe in the room , The hotel was very clean with modern facilities Breakfast was just perfect Mid way to two main underground stations Victoria and Pimlico 
251175,The Belgrave Hotel, Has there been a management change I came away with the perception that there has been a marked change in attitude of the desk staff at book in and again at check out Gone were the cheerful helpful and pleasant receptionists I d met on previous occasions and in place were efficient impersonal and cheerless robots , This was my third stay and the previous experiences have been exemplary maybe this was just an off day Comfortable clean room and good breakfast 
251176,The Belgrave Hotel, The room on arrival seemed a bit claustrophobic but everything was laid out very well considering the tight space , The staff were all very helpful and friendly The room was quiet despite being by the lift 
251177,The Belgrave Hotel, This is the second time we booked at the hotel Last year we had a very good experience with our accommodation and we decided to book the same hotel for this year trip It was a huge disappointment for us The elevator was out of order for all the 6 days that we were there The towels were dirty The cups for the coffee they were dirty too and I also asked for clean ones The toilet wasn t flush and they send someone from the staff to fix it as soon as we arrived One night around midnight there was a false alarm in the hotel and we had to run out of the hotel with our pajamas while we were sleeping Last but not least the day we left we asked the hotel to book a taxi for us we told them we need a taxi that accept visas since we run out of cash they called a taxi and the taxi didn t accept visas When we told to the taxi driver can you please take as to an ATM he denied and he said he don t have time to look for an ATM so he stop the car while he was driving and he asked my husband to go out and go find an ATM before he take us to the bus stop where the bus was waiting for us to take us to the airport my husband went out of the car he found an ATM he had money and we paid him in order to take us to our destination When we arrived he didn t even give us a hand with the luggages and he charged us 22 pounds instead of 6 pounds that we paid last year and of what we used to paid almost everyday during our stay there The hotel was very irresponsible with this and made us feel very uncomfortable and almost miss the bus to airport due to the fact that they didn t care about our request I am very disappointed and I don t know if I will be able to consider visiting the hotel again ,No Positive
251178,The Belgrave Hotel, Unlike other hotels in the road this hotel is quite discreet so remember the address number when looking for it , Recently refurbished and smart Very comfortable though small standard room adequate for us Excellent continental breakfast Staff friendly and helpful 
251179,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, We were made to feel welcome from the minute we walked in the door Nothing was too much trouble from booking a taxi complementary drinks and answering our questions Thanks to Phil and Althina for looking after us The location of the hotel is a very quiet area within walking distance of Victoria coach station We will certainly be returning 
251180,The Belgrave Hotel, wasnt the quietest of hotels i could hear cars from the road outside i could also hear doors banging probably other guests and what sounded like trolleys not sure if it impacted my sleep at all , all clean and tidy looked like it had been recently renovated speedy check in and out friendly front desk staff 
251181,The Belgrave Hotel, A better quality of tea bag in the room really the most minor of points , The room was small but perfectly formed I did not need for anything during my stay the bed was very comfortable and the room surprisingly quiet for central London The location was perfect for my meetings and the decor and cleanliness mean I would even consider coming back for a leisure stay 
251182,The Belgrave Hotel, There wasn t anything I didn t like about the hotel Location fab staff fab cleanliness fab and food fab So pretty fair to say a fab all round experience , The Breakfast was excellent 
251183,The Belgrave Hotel, nothing, Rooms were a good size as was the bathroom Coffee was available in the room and 2 free bottles of water in the fridge Very nice buffet breakfast 
251184,The Belgrave Hotel, Maybe the breakfast s variety could of been a little bit better but it was still rather nice Room size was slightly small but we could survive , Loved the location really friendly staff and modern hotel 
251185,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, Very central location Very close to Pimlico tube station and within walking distance to Victoria Beautiful area Rooms where small but comfortable and bathroom was lovely The continental breakfast which was part of our deal was excellent We would definitely stay again if we are in Lobdon
251186,The Belgrave Hotel, Small rooms Room service left our aircon on at 32deg every day Windows not as sound proof as we d like You can hear a lot of noise come through from the floor above, Perfect location Bathroom big and Shower large enough for 2 Tea Coffee Breaky is great for a tiny fee you can upgrade your breaky to full English which is also great Waitstaff are awesome 
251187,The Belgrave Hotel, We received a very good deal on this room right at 50 for the night For that money it s worth 5 stars However I m well aware the room typically goes for much more I wouldn t pay the typical going rate for a night s stay Several reasons the pillows are awful Flat and rather hard With only one per person we both woke with stiff necks We did try to obtain a couple of extra but there were none to be found The rooms could also do with better sound proofing Aside from the unlucky draw of being placed by the lift we awoke multiple times owing to music and other noises coming through the walls , The hotel and room were well appointed and there were many nice touches Breakfast was particularly fantastic and the shower is ace 
251188,The Belgrave Hotel, The manager on duty was not very friendly We were first given a super small dark room down a narrow stair facing a backyard corner Obviously one of their few standard rooms compared to the other rooms these do not match the standard I also chose this hotel because of the Nespresso machine they have in the rooms Surprise because the standard rooms don t have them After some discussion the manager offered us an upgrade to a bigger room with more light and a Nespresso machine in it but this was at an additional cost and not complimentary Another negative point the air condition in the room worked very poorly and we found out that it can apparently be manually overrun by the reception I froze the whole first night and had to ask for an additional blanket for the second night Too late as I woke up with a cold the next morning , The location is excellent a few minutes walk from Pimlico station Nice design and very clean Good breakfast 
251189,The Belgrave Hotel, Single room a bit on the small side but adequate for a short stay , Ample breakfast Comfortable bed Modern Convenient fittings once I had worked out how to use them

251192,The Belgrave Hotel, Standard room is super tiny for 2 people It s more a single occupancy room Bed is too small for 2 , Location is great breakfast is also quite good Nice lobby with gas fireplace

251195,The Belgrave Hotel, The room we had was an executive but a little on the small side and the bed didn t feel plush more like a plastic cotton feel which was unusual and not as nice as a standard cotton read softer feeling duvet , The continental breakfast was brilliant great selection and good taste And location wise it s about 4 minutes walk to Victoria and about the same to Pimlico so easy to access transport Good shower and friendly staff too 
251196,The Belgrave Hotel, rooms very small and nowhere to put suitcases, the staff in reception could not be more helpful They went out of their way to help and be of assistance 
251197,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and made us welcome the room was nice and clean We were pleased that we were given the Internet code as soon as we arrived 
251198,The Belgrave Hotel, Not one thing , Everything was spot on The continental breakfast was excellent and plentiful The room hotel appeared to be newly decorated and furnished so high was the standard of maintenance As an example I dropped something which went under the bed not a speck of dust when I moved the bed Will certainly stay here again when coming to London
251199,The Belgrave Hotel, The Heating system did not work properly Very noisy and my room was by far too cold did not sleep well , The location was good and the hotel has been recently renovated 
251200,The Belgrave Hotel, Horrible view room was quite small failed to acknowledge my special request of wishing my partner a happy birthday and also this could be just me but I didn t really like paying 20 deposit when booking in only to get the money back after check out , We liked the location hotel was quite clean with a nice little bar and just having all the basics but nothing special that sticks out Great walking distance for viewing of Wicked or Billy Elliott musicals 
251201,The Belgrave Hotel, I had a few issues with my en suite bathroom Also the room was very cold and the heating wasn t particularly effective , The room was tidy with good decor Tea and coffee facilities were useful Breakfast service was good

251205,The Belgrave Hotel, No heating in the middle of January Washbasin in the bathroom totally unusable absolutely impossible to wet shave without flooding the bathroom in all my travels I have never seen such a silly arrangement , Generally a very comfortable and well appointed hotel quality fixtures and fittings however see comment regarding the bathroom

251207,The Belgrave Hotel,No Negative, We have stayed at The Belgrave before and came back due to the superb location facilities and extremely stylish decor This hotel is a gem and we would strongly recommend anyone to book if travelling to London Executive room was fantastic modern chic and very clean Great continental breakfast with lots of choice and croissants to die for Full English is available for a nominal fee 
251208,The Belgrave Hotel, Rooms had wooden floors and we could hear the thumping footsteps of the people in the room above us all night Corridor was noisy Shower was stone cold in the morning , Nice looking hotel 
251209,The Belgrave Hotel, N A, The Belgrave Hotel means a lot to us as we got engaged here in 2013 so I decided to take my partner back for his 30th Birthday When we got to our room there was a bottle of wine box of chocolates and a birthday card from the hotel staff which we thought was a very nice touch The location is perfect and we had a great view of the London Eye and Big Ben The room was very clean and spacious and the bed was very comfortable 
251210,The Belgrave Hotel, It was exciting to have a Nespresso machine in our room sad I know but we couldn t make it work I ve used one before so don t think it was operator error Anyway to be fair to the hotel we didn t bother mentioning it too busy enjoying London , The decor in our en suite room was contemporary tasteful and it was clean and comfortable Really nice shower Everything you needed hairdryer iron etc Room was a good temperature I d stayed once before on business and my room had been cold no matter what I did with the heating Breakfast was nice continental was included in our rate but on the second day we had Full English and Eggs Royal which were lovely It s closest to Pimlico Tube which is just a five min stroll so it s a great base for seeing London Would stay again

251213,The Belgrave Hotel, Nothing, Staff were very friendly and obliging bed very comfortable had two good night s sleep Continental breakfast was excellent we did upgrade to the full English for the second breakfast and that was Well worth the additional 4 each
251214,The Belgrave Hotel, Typical London basic hotel without warmth and small rooms Nothing to complain about as such but as its London it s seems an excuse to be unfriendly and perfunctory, It was clean
251215,The Belgrave Hotel, The breakfast was not impressed there s not many options not like the ordinary English breakfast which supposed to be great and the staff at the breakfast zone don t have a good manner The room is very narrow even I m just a little asian girl , The cleanliness of this hotel is perfect The decorations is lovely

251218,The Belgrave Hotel, Room was small for two people and the bathroom although had a nice shower was also challenging to use for washing teeth and face Breakfast is a joke for the money they ask for I guess this is the standard in London however the average this hotel has now 8 5 is way above what we lived there On the first day our smart TV did not worked could be turned on however no channels could be changed and the remote was fine as also proved to the reception guy Nothing has changed just the TV was randomly working or not Plus we stayed one weekend with entry on Saturday and a Monday At the check in we were told breakfast is until 10 30 However surprise On Mon Fri the breakfast is until 9 30 so Monday morning of course the nice Italian at the restaurant told us basically to bug off as the breakfast is closed, Good location nice entry in the lobby cool Apple computer open for public nice bathroom

251223,The Belgrave Hotel, Nothing to complain about at all , Room was very nice tastefully decorated with a smart bathroom Room size was pretty good too Staff were friendly and helpful I use the underground when in London and it was very handy for Pimlico station Probably the best hotel I ve stayed in in London for the price

251225,The Belgrave Hotel, Standard double room has no wardrobe only 4 hangers on wall hooks This was ok for a 2night stay but if staying longer it would be a nuisance , Central location yet quiet safe area Contemporary decor Variety of fresh food for continental breakfast Tea coffee in room 
251226,The Belgrave Hotel, Breakfast was very disappointing mainly due to being totally disorganised Nobody knew what they were doing there was no cups glasses had to fend for ourselves finding things Cooked breakfast was good despite 1 of our breakfasts being given to another table and we had to wait for a replacement Quite expensive when Cooked breakfast an additional cost , Location Room Clean

251233,The Belgrave Hotel, The only disappointment was that breakfast being an open time 7 30 9 30 most guests had chosen to eat in the second hour so there was a queue when we arrived just after 9 had to wait almost 20 minutes to be seated And then rushed along as the staff wanted to be cleared up by 9 30 Continental breakfast was great tho plenty of choice very fresh and great value for money Probably the reason why so many guests were taking their time , This hotel was a great find Very comfortable room with contemporary decor immaculately clean I stayed here with my 12 year old son would definitely stay again have recommended to friends looking for a nice place to stay in the heart of London at a very reasonable rate

251241,The Belgrave Hotel, I was in a lower ground room and I found out in the morning that the room is located next to the restaurant toilets and therefore when anyone used the hand dryer it was like they were in your bedroom Absolutely no way that you could sleep through this , Only a short walk from Victoria Station and close to many major tourist attractions The room was clean comfortable and modern Many restaurants and cafes in walking distance

251244,The Belgrave Hotel, The receptionist having a cigarette in the doorway when I entered the hotel and then served me smelling of cigarettes, Spotlessly clean great location modern and new fittings
251245,The Belgrave Hotel, The room was ridiculously small for 2 adults with 2 suitcases The bed was a small double I also booked a single room which was the same size as our double Be careful if booking a standard room as you will actually get a single room , Location was great

251252,The Belgrave Hotel, I was not impressed with breakfast on the second day We had continental breakfast included in the price and whilst on the first day there were no issues on the second day I was very disappointed We came down at 9am and we had to wait 5 minutes for a table which would have been ok if that was the only issue We were told by the staff that breakfast had been on since 6 30am and it was pretty much our fault that we had come at the busiest time Nothing was mentioned to us at check in that breakfast would be busy at certain times also forgive me for not wanting to get up at 6am when I was on a long weekend city break After we were seated we then had to wait a further 10 minutes for plates as the kitchen ran out causing a mass scramble between everyone when they did re appear and subsequently quickly vanish meaning other people had to wait even longer for plates While we had our breakfast there were no mugs available meaning we were not able to have a hot drink with our breakfast I would probably look at having breakfast elsewhere or set your alarm , I was very impressed with the cleanliness and comfort of the room 
251253,The Belgrave Hotel, Room too small quite difficult to move in the bathroom Breakfast was a little messy ladies serving seemed a bit lost and stressed there were lots of things missing food cutlery cups and we needed to ask for replacements Layout should definitely be improved in that room to have a better flow , Clean room very convenient location friendly and helpful staff at front desk Good amenities in the room

251256,The Belgrave Hotel, I arrived for breakfast at 10 05am with breakfast being advertised until 10 30 As I arrived there were numerous guests all milling about trying to figure out what one was supposed to do nobody appeared to know or understand the protocol In the end I took a seat and waited for staff to serve me After ten minutes a member of staff came out and announced to a confused guest that chef had finished cooking breakfast and there would be no more served This as you can imagine nearly caused a riot and led myself and five other guests to complain to reception After much confusion and further waiting I was served with a cooked breakfast resembling something that frankly my child could have created At no point did anybody receive an explanation or an apology for the chaos A simple act of which would have gone a long way , Location
