18095,The London EDITION, The rooms were lacking plugs to charge our phones and iPads , Room was large as well as bathroom and decent location The hotel was obvious a going place as the lobby which had a bar and pool table were full of young people having a wonderful time The staff from the front desk to the doormen were friendly and helpful 
18096,The London EDITION, The view from my room was of a dirty inner courtyard but it didn t bother me too much as I only stayed one night , The staff were friendly and helpful The decor in the room had a trendy scandinavian look The bars are all fantastic 
18097,The London EDITION, My only complaint about the room is that you can hear a lot of hallway noise through the doors but it wasn t bad enough to not stay here again I wasn t a fan of Berners Tavern off the lobby While the restaurant is beautiful the food was quite poor except the dessert and was a real disappointment , Very friendly and helpful staff Rooms are perfectly laid out and feel very spacious Bed was comfortable Huge immaculate bathroom Location is convenient and easy to walk to many shops restaurants and bars I really liked the lobby bar and the drinks were well made Overall had a great stay and would stay again at Edition 
18098,The London EDITION, Nothing it was perfect , We stayed here for our wedding night plus an additional night They made us feel so welcome and added a few treats to the room on our arrival Food was divine The bathroom was fantastic Staff were wonderful and friendly We will definitely be coming back 
18099,The London EDITION, Nothing really Not the cheapest room in London but I wasn t looking for the cheapest , Great staff beautiful rooms and amazing lobby and restaurant tavern This place smells like HEAVEN really
18100,The London EDITION, The rooms had a kind of sparse minimalist feel to them and they had one of those strange pictures of a woman s head whose eyes followed you around the room The light switches were also quite strange and not the easiest to operate , Excellent staff very helpful and very friendly When there was a problem with the bathroom it was sorted to our satisfaction The restaurant was fantastic and the fixed lunch menu excellent value
18101,The London EDITION, Difficult to connect to the wifi at first I found the room a little small despite choosing a higher category Check out was very long as there was a queue , Loved the friendliness of the staff especially in the restaurant they sent up special complimentary cocktails for us to enjoy the weekend Beautiful hotel restaurant Breakfast brunch choices were excellent The quality of the restaurant food was very high Excellent stay overall 
18102,The London EDITION, Standard double bedroom is very small Request high floor bedroom to avoid noise from bar restaurant, Excellent bar great atmosphere Berners Taverner food really good with lively atmosphere All staff very helpful 
18103,The London EDITION, Despite requesting a room with a bath at booking time six months prior to arrival we were initially allocated a room without a bath They changed us without any fuss but it would have been better if it hadn t happened at all , Bed was amazing the bathroom was great the food delicious but the staff showed fantastic professionalism and customer service without being over the top 
18104,The London EDITION, We stayed in a loft room which was very nice but also relatively expensive so it s surprising that the in room extras were so distinctly lacking The shampoo conditioner and shower gel were tiny and by not being an established brand it makes them in any case feel cheap there was also no toothpaste or toothbrushes Perhaps even more disappointing though was that we had to order tea from room service surely a base expectation in any hotel is that you can make a cup of tea Added to which the coffee machine only had two capsules and no fresh milk Also quite why you would make people pay for films just offer the sky movies like most other decent hotels As a comparison the Dean Street Townhouse is similarly priced but they provide full sized bottles of the full range of their cowshed products in the room this is an established brand and a very nice touch they also provide toothbrushes and toothpaste etc recognising that you may not want to bring this with you for short stays There is also ample coffee pods tea options and fresh milk Generally it feels like a far more personal experience If honest for the best part of 1 000 I spent on a one night stay for the the room drinks and dinner at the London Edition I feel more could be done to make the experience about the customer rather than the profit margin , Nice room in an impressive building great restaurant and cocktails 
18105,The London EDITION, The concierge who was rude and arrogant to two female members of our party on separate occasions , The attention to detail of staff was truly exceptional We were there over Christmas and the staff made the experience one to remember 
18106,The London EDITION,No Negative, The London Edition was amazing discovery Situated near Oxford Street it s within walking distance to a subway station SOHO Piccadilly The Staff was very helpful and friendly The Punch Bar at the back of the hotel is definitely worth the try The room is very spacious and the minibar is just sublime 
18107,The London EDITION, This is being a little picky but I would have liked a dressing table with a mirror with lights to put my makeup on instead of standing in the bathroom where the lit mirror was perfect as there was no place to rest your make up apart from the wet sink an the full length mirror was in the living area an the lighting of the room was quite dim with no option of having stronger lights on, We had a loft suite an the view was great an we had a huge terrace which would be amazing in the nicer weather if I stayed here again I would request the same room
18108,The London EDITION, absolutely nothing, the legant and welcoming Lobby outstanding Restaurant Food and atmosphere very friendly considerate and professional staff caring and perceptive way of dealing with children perfect Problem solving comfortable cosy and stylish room best shower ever our daughter is very fond of this hotel
18109,The London EDITION, Staff at the Punch Bar were a little brusque and somewhat dismissive even though we had made reservations , Very stylish lobby and nice ambience The adjoining restaurant is very good The location is very convenient Receptionist staff and doormen very polite and friendly 
18110,The London EDITION,No Negative, The location of the hotel is excellent Soho 2mins away and Oxford St at your doorstep All staff were genuinely friendly and accommodating The ambience of the hotel is very hip and youthful also not forgetting the magnificent decor No matter wha the buttermilk pancakes is a must try for breakfast at Berners Tavern 
18111,The London EDITION, Consirege he recommended a dreadful restaurant and wasn t very on the ball with other suggestions Also hotel guests are not prioritized for the onsite restaurant and it s always fully booked So don t just turn up and stay thinking you have a table , Super cool hotel great restaurant amazing location Spanish lady called Isabella is seriously slick sorts everything out and very attentive Proper hustle and bustle but in a very organized way Impressive location if you have meetings 
18112,The London EDITION, Some minor staff issues first ended up in a room that was already taken Free cakes as compensation were taken out off the room before I could eat them Also free internet did not work at first as my name was misspelled Friendly staff though , While other Ian Schrager hotels often felt like a rip off with small rooms and high charges for all kinds of extras this concept offers better value for money Big room free water And of course a great design and atmosphere 
18113,The London EDITION, No bath just a shower , The staff are wonderful nothing was a problem and every recommendation they made for restaurants etc were fantastic The hotel is fabulous and Berners restaurant and the 2 bars had a great vibe 
18114,The London EDITION, WiFi was extremely bad kept disconnecting and completely unreliable Ruined the experience throughout my entire stay Room service menu as well as my one time lunch in the restaurant the menu is small and food wasn t as good as expected and definitely wasn t worth the price paid, Location room cleanliness as well as comfort bedding pillows sheets was above expectations and very satisfying
18115,The London EDITION, When booked thru Booking no Marriot SPG points and nights no space for private meetings or to talk on the phone besides your own room There is no separation between lobby and bar so things get a little messy Room service very unprofessional and expensive restaurant beautiful but the food is not on the same level Expensive hotel no loyalty program , Interesting hotel beautiful modern room nice concierge service very good location 
18116,The London EDITION, Room request as I have stayed in before not available and room not ready for early check in Everything else was outstanding Room substitute was just ok but overall service excellent,No Positive
18117,The London EDITION, No tea or coffee making facilities, Location was excellent beautiful lobby comfortable rooms Reasonably priced breakfast room service Helpful and friendly staff 
18118,The London EDITION, Probably the only thing is that the bread at breakfast was plain kind of white bread It would be better if they understand bread has moved on from light useless white bread Even white bread doesn t want to be white bread anymore Whole grain multigrain sourdough dark rye etc is way better , Super comfy bed Very nice and helpful staff Great looking facilities Beautiful foyer Perhaps a strange like but we liked we could actually open the window even though it was just a little bit Overall excellent 
18119,The London EDITION, Well we did see a mouse in the bar downstairs But I m sure the hotel is dealing with the issue and having worked many years in central London I am far from naive in this respect Those things happen , It s the most amazing hotel with a very unique atmosphere The attention to detail is on another level We loved it and will be back as soon as possible 
18120,The London EDITION, Rooms are rather small yet this is the case with most hotels in London , Staff was extremely friendly and helpful Incredibly convenient location And of course bath amenities made specifically for the hotel 
18121,The London EDITION,No Negative, Very nice hotel although rather expensive straff very friendly When we arrived in the afternoon the rooms were not ready yet but to compensate the inconveniences they offered us an upgrade very good attitude 
18122,The London EDITION, guaranteed check in time is 3 pm but we had to wait longer the service at berners tavern during breakfast was consistently very slow the hair dryer can not be used in the bathroom due to lack of power outlet maybe this is due to security policy but certainly an inconvenience , superior room is big enough with a big rain shower which we loved however there wasnt ample wardrobe space or drawers lobby area is quiet nice concierge is amazingly helpful and very quick to reply all the staff was very helpful and nice actually 
18123,The London EDITION, the room was cold in feeling with very little furniture and no place to put things it was also less than i paid for but i paid ahead of time and they would not change it i blame booking com for that,No Positive
18124,The London EDITION, Overpriced and only deserving of a 4 star rating The superior room we got was tiny horribly hot with a view over the service yard The room didn t have basic facilities like an iron and coffee or tea facilities which in a 5 star was a bit poor The decor was so sparse and cheaply finished in the bedrooms felt more IKEA than premium You also need to reserve in advance a table in the punch bar even if you are a hotel guest which would have been helpful to know before arriving or even when checking in but we only found this out when we went to go for a drink and were rudely turned away Overall an underwhelming 4 star hotel , Well located with a good lobby vibe
18125,The London EDITION, Very small room even with an upgrade But this is common in London unless you pay for a suite Otherwise rooms very high standard, Incredible location with extremely well trained staff The entire ambience of the place makes it one of the best hotels in Central London A real treat
18126,The London EDITION,No Negative, I love how the staff pay close attention on the specific requirement of the customer I asked for the scary looking woman painting in the room to be removed and the staff sure did remove them from the room like I have requested Very impressive 
18127,The London EDITION, It was difficult to find 2 seats in the bar as a hotel guest They made an error with the bill as charged us for breakfast which we had already paid, Lovely bedroom Very modern bed was huge comfy pillows Very good quality breakfast and attentive staff 
18128,The London EDITION, The only problem i face was they didn t have my booking number I stayed for one hour at front desk trying to explain to them that i booked 2 months ago It shows then that they didnt get the comfermation from booking And after that they want to charge me with a room rate that is higher that what i book Tell i manage to get access to my booking and show them all the details and price , The room the matress was perfect The location friendly staff
18129,The London EDITION, NIL, The London EDITION is exactly that a brilliant encapsulation of everything that is London in a cool and contemporary hotel Ian Schrager at his best 
18130,The London EDITION, Breakfast not included in rate was expensive We had a view of construction site that was opposite hotel no bath, Great restaurant staff location beautiful building rooms good but no bath was disappointing 
18131,The London EDITION, The rooms are expensive enough but they charge for every little detail and the bar is very very expensive, The central position for shopping Soho theatres
18132,The London EDITION, Nothing, Stayed for new year s eve because we wanted to celebrate and were not disappointed Decor comfort welcome cocktails in room and upgraded room Lovely toiletries great shower room comfortable and quiet Wonderful restaurant fab new years special menu cocktails and great breakfast Faultless service
18133,The London EDITION, rooms are not as luxious as the rest of the hotel, the staff is adorable the public spaces are beautiful lobby bar restaurant localisation
18134,The London EDITION, The wood panelling of the rooms is not to everyone s taste At night we had a choice between being too hot air con off or constant humming air con on Until I found out that the windows do open Which resulted in air con going into overdrive , Fabulous location for Soho and Theatreland We walked down to the Gielgud in about 9min Awesome interior design of lobby snd restaurant Very comfy bed luxurious bathroom and massive well placed flatscreen And the black tea scent permeating the whole place by Le Labo is just intoxicating 
18135,The London EDITION, The room was too cold air conditioning not working No spare toilet paper nor toilet brush The room was not very comfortable and had a weird sour smell The Lobby was also cold And the staff was friendly but not really 5 star standard A lot of details were not taken care of such as taking dirty dishes away by room service Bad lighting in the room No electronic plug in the bathroom for hair drying , Food Drinks were good Room service quite quick and 24h a day The location of the hotel is perfect Design of the lobby is nice and modern We were able to have early check in and late check out 
18136,The London EDITION, Oh dear I can put up with the water leak at 1 am in the morning and having to move rooms these things happen I m not impressed with being told that my room is not available at check in and would I like an upgrade for more money I suspect someone is on performance related bonuses very suspicious of that one Valet parking forgot to get my car when I checked out made me late for meeting not impressed, Attention from staff excellent
18137,The London EDITION, Didn t love the service in the dining hall and bar area Also wish there was an outlet in the bathroom , I love how modern yet cocoon like the rooms are and how the building is old beautiful and well updated Also love that it s a popular hotel but is supremely quiet and clean in the rooms The room service is delicious as is the food in the dining hall Service is pretty impeccable I wouldn t want to stay anywhere else when visiting London 
18138,The London EDITION, Even though I booked a room to accommodate 1 adult and 2 children we had to share a king sized bed I was originally offered a queen which I spent most of the night trying not to fall out of , Great location service f b Beautiful interiors
