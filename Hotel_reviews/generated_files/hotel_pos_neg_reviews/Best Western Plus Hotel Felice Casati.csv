474882,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Rooms did not really feel too comfy but good enough to sleep Maybe I am being picky everything was fine given the price This was a good option for a low price close to the city center If you require modern extra comfy hotel pay a premium and choose some other hotels in 4 star category or just go for 5 stars, Staff were great breakfast not bad given the price location of the hotel is quite good wifi worked well if you hire a car there are a number of car parks within walking distance at Central station 
474883,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati,No Negative, The people at the reception where very friendly and ready to help the breakfast was nice the bed very comfortable the room really clean overall everything was fantastic
474884,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, The booking was prepaid so our entire stay was already paid weeks earlier than we arrived Upon arrival I was asked to present the credit card I used for the booking That means the exact same physical credit card When checking in I expect to have to give a credit card in case of extra expenses during the stay so I gave them the one I had with me However it appeared to be a problem that it was not the precise one used for the booking I don t understand this I travelled to Best Western hotels in Japan China USA Germany and more and it never ever happened that people cared about having the exact same card I did the booking with I could somehow understand it if I had only secured the booking and still had to pay on checkout but here it was even prepaid I finally managed to retrieve my credit card bill in which the booking transaction appeared because fortunately I had gotten it a few days earlier and it was easily accessible online and this did the trick I still don t get why it was needed I am ready to accept that it is required for some reasons I don t know but asking for the precise card used for the booking is highly non standard even more when prepaid so it should at least be clearly indicated somewhere I checked the booking confirmation sheet and this requirement appears nowhere What if I was travelling on a business trip and my stay was paid with my company credit card I would not have had easily access to any bill and would not have had the credit with me either The minimum thing to do would thus be to indicate this requirement in huge bold letters in the hotel description or the confirmation The future travellers owning more than one credit card and not always going around with all of them will be grateful , The hotel is extremely well located and very cozy Rooms are a bit small but very comfy It is the perfect place for a holiday weekend in the city 
474885,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, We received a very small room it was hard to turn around however not all the rooms are that small so when you book just ask for a more spacious one , We liked everything Very nice and helpful staff Very beautiful location we stayed in other areas of the city center and this was the best one Very nice and beautiful hotel

474977,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, The room was very small considering that when I was booking I made a choice to pay a little extra for a bigger room , The hotel has a great location and the staff were very helpful It s also very clean 
474978,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Room is very small very hot and without air Bathroom is very small two people cannot stay together Furniture is old if you do not expect anything from room you can go because of breakfast , Breakfast is very good 
474979,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, We had an early flight and landed in Milan at 8AM Hotel check in at 2 understood When I booked the room I mentioned early check in and the hotel made no effort to get us in before 2pm We had a tour at 2 30 pm so we had no access to a hotel room from 9AM until 6pm after our tour It was unpleasant We called at noon to see if there was a chance to have access earlier no 2pm Also the room was very small only room to sleep , Clean breakfast was good friendly staff enjoyed courtyard 
474980,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, The shower was on the small side , We have stayed in this hotel many times and this time the room we had was larger than normal and as always everything was very clean 
474981,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, I liked the hotel but the rooms are really cramped I stayed in a luxury room and it was tiny but nice and cosy , I thought the staff was excellent and very polite The location is good as well 10mins walk from central station and also a 10mins walk to Lima
474982,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Nothing except that there was a shower in the room not a bathtub but it s not really a problem, The staff are very awesome they allowed us to check in 2 hours earlier and asked us if we wanted to leave our luggage after checkout so enjoy our last day They even offered us the drinks we consumed from the mini bar They managed to make a queen size bed for us upon our arrival and recommended to us what to do in the the city and how to get to places The breakfast is very generous and there are lots of varieties I definitely recommend it They offer free bikes as well for their consumers Thank you Deborah 
474983,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Not enough tables seats for breakfast Bit small room and toilet, Very fresh room Nice location close to couple of restaurants and 15min walk to city centre Good value for money
474984,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Disappointment was the fact that we booked the bigger and more expensive Standard double room 15 m2 as advertised by booking com but we were still given the tiny cheaper Economy room 12 m2 where there was hardly any space to move around the receptionist explained that all rooms are of the same size and no other rooms were available so waste of money , Location was fine close to metro corso Buenos Aires central station
474985,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Room was a little small but not an issue, Breakfast was excellent location was perfect close to Central station 10 mins walk and 10 mins to underground Bed very comfortable had no problem sleeping
474986,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, If you are a tall person don t book the Economy room It s small and bed is tiny , Kind and helpful staff Very clean Nice breakfast with proper Italian espresso Interestingly designed interior Good location fairly close to Centrale near the shopping district of Corso Buenos Aires and walking distance to Duomo 
474987,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Good location and closeness to public transportation , Good experience but at times not so much so The staff was comfrontational several times and unable or unwilling to address concerns such as providing clean linen The reason They had ran out Really 
474988,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati,No Negative, The staff was very pleasant and helpful The room was very clean and comfortable The location of the hotel is perfect more or less 15min walk to any central location shopping areas sightseeing etc 
474989,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Their TV channels is not in English language and there s no way they can convert the English movies into English , The staff management were very helpful 
474990,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Mediocre sound insulation especially between room and corridor, Staff is very good Free bicycles are nice to visit city However they are small for someone 165 170cm max 
474991,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, City Tax is suppose to vary from 2 5 depending on the room size class etc but looks like its 5 for every room as i stayed in a single room , Everything was good Good buffet breafast 
474992,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, the building looks great but the floor we were in was clearly older it was absolutely fine and like the pictures but it will be amazing if they renew everything , good location between central station and city centre good breakfast room corresponds to picture 
474993,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Room was noisy but ok for 1 night, Hotel is in walking distance to the city centre and shopping and also to the main station Staff was friendly and breakfast absolutely fine 
474994,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, In the middle of 2 metro stations Republica Porta Venezia so not far but not close at same time, Close to city centre and train station 15min walking distance Good standards beds are comfortable and breakfast is ok Value for money
474995,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, very hard bed breakfast was somewhat uninspiring bathroom was a bit small for people taller than 180 cm , room was cosy great location close to city centre 
474996,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Very very small room Incredibly small desk There was stuff that needed to be fixed in the room when I got there they fixed it right away though Breakfast below average it s better in other BW in Milano and you have to pay for Orange Juice really , There is a Gym small one but nice and tidy The staff at the front desk is nice but the dining room staff never says hi nor checks your room number when you go for breakfast like in the others BW 
474997,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Drainage in the bathroom was quite slow, Staff is extremely friendly The hotel looks very nice especially at Christmas time Tastefully decorated They have a printer and two computers and we were able to print our bording tickets 
474998,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Inside our room you could hear people walking in the hallway or in other rooms Breakfast selection was regular , It s within walking distance of 2 metro stations and near a very commercial area with a lot of clothing shops The hotel is very elegantly decorated Great coffee for breakfast 
474999,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, There is a nice outdoor area for the smokers but I would strongly recommend that some external heating is installed Breakfast was rich but it was a but funny that should you want fresh orange juice extra charge of 5 euros was required In my experience orange juice is the most common juice people drink so the charge was a bit over the top , Everyone was impressed with the mattresses Really posh hotel good value for money 
475000,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, When I returned to hotel at night and found the light bulb in my toilet was not working and front desk staff told me they can only fix it next morning and I have to take shower in the dark Terrible service,No Positive
475001,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, nothing much just that it would have been nice to have some slippers provided , Although at first it looked like it s in a not so good location we quickly found out that it was closer to the Metro than we thought 
475002,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Not good value for money Room was small and dull Bathroom very small with leak from the ceiling Air conditioning was switched off Room stuffy without it When switched on it was very noisy , Good location and staff very friendly Lounge was pleasant and bar drinks reasonably priced 
475003,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Cleaning started early in the morning The most loud cleaning i have ever heard Impossible to sleep longer than 8 in the morning After this renovation work started in the other rooms on the floor No mention of this before booking Breakfast ended 10 30 but already before 10 00 items on the breakfast was empty and no refill , Friendly staff
475004,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, The place has definitely passed its prime and is in need of some serious renovation The staff at the reception during checkin was very rude, It s a good location
475005,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, It didn t deserve the 4 rating breakfast was very average the room was very small deceptive in the picture it wasn t quiet as requested The safety deposit box was broken When reported nothing was done , It was central close to the airport and walking distance of central Milan attractions 
475006,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Restaurant is the only place to have a meal but service is slow and with not a warm attitude when I was there alone Others in group got served before me even though I was there first , Location is close to airport Shuttle service driver was nice and friendly 
475007,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, One of the staff in reception is not nice , The hotel is about 15 minutes walk to the railway station Nice and quiet neighbourhood Close to business centre and subway station and some good restraurants The room is clean and tidy There is a gym in the hotel Everything is good and comfortable and you can rent a bike from the hotel for sightseeing 
475008,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati,No Negative, Booked this as thought it was near to the train station but it was further than we anticipated and not in a brilliant area However once inside the hotel was very good

475010,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Noise from rooms Kind of loud air conditioner , Good location walking distance to via Buenos Aires and shopping Kind of in a neighborhood so not too busy Hotel is good but breakfast was weak Rooms are tight and easy to hear noise in other rooms 
475011,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Not that much choice for breakfast if you try to avoid wheat products bread pastries cakes muffins Almost no fresh vegetables only cherry tomatoes , Great location only several minutes from metro but in quite a calm street Easy to find walking from Centrale The area looked ok in terms of safety Wifi in the room worked well Big room and bathroom 
475012,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Tiny rooms and bathroom poor sound proofing excessive smell of air fresheners everywhere really slow and hard to connect wifi Can t believe this is a 4 star , Staff was super nice and attentive 
475013,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Room is tiny bed is small and breakfast assortment is poor and doesnt taste well apart from Buffalo cheese and cherry tomatos pastry was not fresh and tasted bad Same pastry was served two three days in a row , very good location close to Milano Centrale Clean room

475016,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, Wifi is slow, Near to city centre and central station Free printing facilities in business centre Good breakfast and all day coffee and cookies Cycles available to see the city 
475017,Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati, The area where the hotel is located felt a little sketchy It s a short 10 minute walk from Milan Centrale train station which is why we chose it but the area between the hotel and the station wasn t the best We were approached by a man asking if we wanted to buy drugs , The hotel is beautiful Our two rooms were both elegantly decorated and very comfortable When we arrived they upgraded one of our rooms free of charge
