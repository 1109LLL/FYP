378118,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, it isn t a true aparthotel Despite having a kitchen the room does not has a table or chairs to sit and have a meal Because of this we didn t had any advantage of a aparthotel features The breakfast is too expensive 12 person is a lot Because of this we decided to take the breakfast at a bakery which was very good and is located in front of the hotel We recommend it , Room kitchenette support
378119,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, The property is a bit dated and could do with some renovation but in general the hotel was great value for money , Room was spacious and the bed was comfortable Location was perfect for what we needed and the area was quiet 
378120,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, A bit noisy outside bikes and and those garbage collectors at 1 00 and 2 00 lol , Staff is so kind and will help you with any questions even not standard Food in restaurant is very good 
378121,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, Little noisy could hear it when my neighbour had his shower at 6 in the morning Low water pressure in shower Somewhat small bread selection at breakfast , Clean huge room with jacuzzi on the balcony Comfortable bed Nice staff Good breakfast with good fruit selection not into fruit though Reasonable price so all in all perfect value for money 
378122,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, First room allocated smelled strongly of paint and right next to the lifts after we requested a quiet room Moved to another smaller room where the shower was lukewarm and splashed all over the bathroom Staff weren t interested in providing compensation for the inconveniences , Breakfast was good 
378123,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, No desk , New furnishings Best bed I have slept in for ages Nice sheets and new decor great except they forgot to add a desk for business traveler computers 
378124,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, All facilities as offered when booking were not available when we stayed The restaurant was only open for breakfast no other food was available to us The television in one of our rooms did not work I reported this and nothing was done We had rooms with kitchenettes but no facilities for making a drink such as a kettle We were not given our glass of cava on arrival which would of been nice considering our celebrations , The property was within easy access to the train and metro stations 
378125,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, very few kitchenwares unlike other Apartment hotels no dishwashers Car parking is bit expensive and you have no other options due to the narrow street Parking was quite tough especially with a bigger car, Rooms were very clean and neat location was very proximate to the nearest Metro Very comfortable to stay with family
378126,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, Was not furnished properly room had no seating couch was turned into beds or table to eat on Not ideal with young kids Housekeeping a bit hit and miss never replaced the two coffee capsules despite a three night stay need our morning coffee forgot to empty the full bin one morning Hallways very dusty and evident they were undergoing maintenance which they did preemptively apologise for That said I would stay again just not sure why they would let rooms out if they are not ready , Very nice man on the front desk went out of his way to help Spacious Location is good not on the tourist highway but an easy 10 minute walk to the main road 
378127,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, Needed a fitness center Also our rate did not include breakfast , Staff were helpful Breakfast was good and convenient but not included in our rate 
378128,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, Wi fi did not work for two days the fitfth floor were we stayed was under construction so it was a lot of noise during day time Breakfast not included we did not try No wellcome drink as promised They refused to give us the rooms until 2 pm we know that is the rule but still , We liked the room with the terrace the Smart TV was great curved and big Beds are very comfortable and sheet are clean and good quality 
378129,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, We booked an apartment for 3 The third bed was set up in front of the balcony door and was very much an extra fold up bed Street was noisy due to rubbish collection Rooms not very well insulated against noise, Room was a good size and comfortable
378130,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, Could hear the next door neighbour snoring at night and cleaners in all surrounding rooms in the morning , Clean spacious and the staff allowed us our freedom around the hotel and in our room 
378131,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona,No Negative, The staff were amazing everyone is super friendly and helpful they ve managed to give us ana amazing guide through the city s most important attractions
378132,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, Neigbourhood is so noisy The hotel is so niosy also because of some renovations , The room is big and clean There are fancy restaurants just outside of the hotel 
378133,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, It took us a bit of time to get used to the location in the short time we were there so we used Taxi s a lot but they are very cheap , The apartment was huge with a massive bed that could easily sleep 3 Staff were very friendly and welcoming 
378134,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, there was no view from the window in our room but we were happy because the room overall was great, The room was large and very homely for the money large bathroom and comfy bed with its own lounge would recommend to anyone and happily stay again Over all a fantastic stay with incredibly friendly staff giving us suggestions to explore in the city 
378135,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, Sofa bed located alongside TV We had to move it to see TV, We had inadvertently booked a room without a kitchenette Staff changed to a room with one without fuss 
378136,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, Unfortunately for the money you spend in this place you expect a far better service which you do not get The staff was not extremely nice or helpful In particular there is a lady who we asked for directions for a supermarket and looked at my brother and I as if we were from Mars We also asked for directions from the airport and thank goodness my cousin lives in Barcelona and saved us quite a long travel time The worst happened on our third day of our stay where the cleaning lady knocked on our door at 3 30pm to do the room and basically wanted to kick us out 10 minutes later we had new guests coming into our room since it seemed that the guy at reception had given them our room we were not checking out until the next day We never got a call from reception to apologise for this confusion instead we had to go down and ask what was going on Furthermore that same day the wi fi stopped working for over an hour If you want to have breakfast it is 11 euro per person extra every day on top of the price you already pay We already knew this thanks to Booking However it seems ridiculous that this establishment charges for the breakfast taking into account the price quality relation , The room was cleaned every day by the hotel staff 
378137,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, Parking is supposed to be only for Smarts or Minicoopers Compact cars are already too big Other cars even could not enter the parking place , Room is quite specious small kitchen 
378138,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, Air conditioning had been turned off from October Fridge wasn t cold Hot water ran out if showered late in morning Strong smell of cigarettes when returning to room after cleaning Some bathroom fittings foyer lounges starting to look tired , Very friendly helpful desk staff 
378139,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, The only thing was the kitchenette area no kitchen towel washing up liquid or sponge Most people travel with hand luggage only so wouldn t probably bring these items They should be provided Also there was no soap in the bathroom I thought like the kitchen this wasn t provided until some turned up on the last day The kitchenette wasn t cleaned either so I did that myself but these are small points and didn t have any detrimental effect on my stay It was half term so the price was very expensive but hopefully next time it will be out if season and more affordable , I loved the area Gracia and the property was in a fairly quiet street It was close to the centre and the metro was only 5 minutes walk away 2 stops to Plaza Catalunya The room was spacious and the bed extremely comfortable so I enjoyed a very relaxing few days As I was in Barcelona for the football it was a lovely walk to the Camp Nou approximately 40 minutes walk along the Avenida Diagonal I have finally found a place I would return to and the added bonus of simple kitchen facilities was a bonus as was a small balcony Staff were very friendly and very helpful which is a huge plus 
378140,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, The hotel doesn t have a bar The bar was only open when the restaurant was open We could hear the people in the room above walking around their room at 6 30 am this was a nuisance maybe some sort of sound proofing wouldn t go amiss , The bed was nice and big At breakfast there was plenty to choose from continental style cereal toast etc and always courteous staff Rooms are large and clean with good facilities 
378141,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, having to keep the key card for the lights and this is only hotel that i ve ever been in that did not have an electric outlet for us type plugs , did not eat at the hotel and the beds were average

378143,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, For a 4star hotel I was very dissapointed with the breakfast as quality was poor They had a range of meat which was all pork No chicken or beef The pastry range was cold and definitely not fresh Even the coco pops didn t turn the milk chocolatey how is that possible And the room walls might as well not have existed U can hear everything going on in your neighbours rooms I was with kids clearly they will not be mute Then the neighbour tells my kids that others r trying to sleep Very disappointed with the hotel as clearly the walls r not reinforced, Staff were friendly
378144,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, Air conditioning was very weak in the bedrooms was very difficult to sleep at night, Certain staff members were veryou helpful helped plan our days and transportation

378149,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, Dreadful for noise levels 2 nights of NO sleep whatsoever as next door were slamming and banging doors and screaming all night Hotel staff were not very sympathetic and were more interested in what we used in the mini bar Breakfast was awful don t pay 11 Euros go outside, Lovely hotel clean facilities and nice rooms Not worth the rate that was charged but nice anyhow
378150,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, My only complaint was the breakfast However it was only a minor complaint and the cost was deducted from my bill without question , Excellent for disabled travellers ramps lifts wet room It was very clean and great access to metro buses and train cafe s bars restaurants supermarkets

378158,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, The room was not soundproof enough can hear noise from next door Could have been nice to have a microwave and washing liquid in the room , Friendly and helpful staff tidiness and closeness to the city senter 
378159,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, Turning up to be told to go to a different hotel on your birthday meant we felt as though we d lost a day of our holiday Not fun packing and unpacking a small child And then very loud people arguing at 2 00am made us wonder if we should have stayed in the replacement hotel The walls are so thin , The staff were great and the room when we eventually got into it was big and airy 
378160,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, The tap water is a bit hard better to buy bottle water from any of the nearby stores, Great location short walk to many caf and public transport bus metro At night no noise as the street is a small one and there is no traffic 
378161,Aparthotel Mariano Cubi Barcelona, Basically no big problems only the bathtube is quite small and dark but acceptable and in my room the TV is impossible to be watched on bed becouse it would be blocked by wall but it is ok because we seldom watch tv in the hotel room , The staff are friendly and helpful rooms are big comfortable and beautiful We stayed for three nights and had a good time there we were looking forward to backing room every nights We love the kitchen that allows us to try the local canned food and make breakfest for ourselves The bed is big enough clean and comfortable The air conditioner is perfect Everything was perfect with the very reasonable price
