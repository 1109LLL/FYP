392394,Das Opernring Hotel,No Negative, Reception was excellent We did last minute booking and was given a room early in the morning Extremely helpful and nice hotel staff Very spacious room and good location 
392395,Das Opernring Hotel, Poor lighting in the room despite the fact one of the bed side lights was out of order no carpet on the floor making the room feeling unpleasant and in general dark The bathroom 1 hairdryer the main body where the hot air comes out smashed broken 2 shower head whichever direction twisted still water spreading on the floor whilst the shower screen over the bathtub in place 3 toilet seat cover one plug fitting missing exposing a little hole 4 the bottom part of the bathroom door the paint has gone probably due to dampness 5 a hand wash basin chipped at the very front place I was also not happy about the quality of the juice served at the breakfast multivitamin like tasted slightly fermented I mentioned to staff about this and I was apologised and served a fresh one straight from the new box which tasted differently very good Staff at the reception friendly but the appearance not very professional with funky pinkish colour glasses and no smart shirt as for 4 star hotel was quite strange experience , Great location by the Opera close to underground station and very short distance to main tourist attractions Spacious room with a balcony Clean bathroom and linen comfortable beds Very tasty breakfast especially coffee was good but disappointed by quality of multivitamin juice 
392396,Das Opernring Hotel, The room overlooks the ring road and it could be very noisy with the traffic and sirens outside While it didn t bother me it s something to note if you are sensitive about noise , Staff were very friendly and extremely accomodating My room was upgraded to a Junior Suite very spacious and the bed was quite comfortable neither very hard nor soft Breakfast was delicious with an assortment of croissants and rolls fresh fruit and veggies plus cereal eggs sausages and more Air conditioning worked very well This hotel is close to a lot of the museums and parks and quite close to the subway as well 
392397,Das Opernring Hotel, The wifi was rubbish so much so that most of the time my iPad connected to the stronger signal from the adjacent Meridien The room unfortunately looked out onto the Ring which sounds nice but the traffic noise was bad especially as the air con was not working so if you closed the albeit good double glazed window it was a bit stuffy Better to try a hotel on a quieter street and one that has real wifi , Spacious clean room and good breakfast 
392398,Das Opernring Hotel, Everything was perfect , My wife is delighted with the hotel and staff Room was perfect with very good sound isolation so you cannot hear anything from outside She had in the room everything she needed Best regards to manager Harold and all staff and thank you for everything 
392399,Das Opernring Hotel, The shower tub feels a bit unstable, Front desk person called Yigal Alstschuler is an absolute gem Very friendly and knows all the places to go Just wonderful

392407,Das Opernring Hotel, The entrance and lobby look a tad worn out as does the elevator but are not representative for the hotel So don t let yourself be deceived Artwork reproductions based on Pucci is outdated , Large functional room with nice high ceilings Not hyper modern but more than adequate Renovated bathroom Perfect breakfast

392427,Das Opernring Hotel, The walls are a bit thin so you can hear next door and outside I was worried I wouldn t be able to fall asleep with the street noise but oddly enough the city quiets down about 9 30p The mornings however I was woken with the breakfast preparations and guests as my room was on the 3rd floor just beside the dining area , The breakfast was above par and the staff is incredible They were so friendly and willing to help direct me to all the places I wanted to go They were accommodating and expressed an obvious desire to provide the best customer service and were even sensitive to my dietary needs as well The location is also prefect for the main attractions of Inner Stradt metro Neuermarkt which was an superb suggestion by the manager

392433,Das Opernring Hotel, ok well I m not sure if we were given an older room but the hotel standard just didn t warrant the stars it is rated The bedroom felt a little cramped and although the sitting area was nice it didn t match up to the pics advertised If anyone has a major issue with super soft pillows just bring your own to be on the safe side , Great staff very accommodating and the hotel was cleaned thoroughly once a day The location was great within walking distance of Opera nice restaurants nearby and really close to public transport as well as hop on and hop off bus services Most nights afforded a quiet sleep

392441,Das Opernring Hotel, The elevator the corridors the bathroom and the staircase are old I would say alltogether this would be rather a 3 than a 4 hotel But the staff breakfast and the location compensate the old building , The location is excellent and the staff was very friendly 
392442,Das Opernring Hotel, Nothing , The gentleman on reception was excellent He spoke every language he knew everyone by name You did not have to give him your room number he knew it He was so helpful With great recommendations for restaurants etc He is a great asset to the hotel He was interested in what you were doing etc Lovely breakfast room Very very central 
392443,Das Opernring Hotel, Because the building is an historic one they have not been able to add air conditioning and it was 90 degrees Fahrenheit while we were there Nevertheless they provided a good electric fan and we managed fine , A lovely location right in the thick of things We were upgraded to a junior suite and it was spacious and well furnished Breakfast was a full buffet with delightful choices The front desk was very helpful

392446,Das Opernring Hotel, I m not a fan of hotels putting two single beds together and calling it a double it s very uncomfortable and misleading , Breakfast was fab Free champagne Yes please The location couldn t be better and the staff was very helpful and friendly 
392447,Das Opernring Hotel, Internet connection Wifi was not stable though there were a few stations to switch to and the connection was painfully slow, Exceptionally kind personnel who made us feel at home fantastic location across the street from the Opera and in walking distance to nearly all main attractions and metro within 3 min walk Spacious room excellent bathroom good bed Breakfast was quite good with warm fresh bread and fruit good coffee 
392448,Das Opernring Hotel, Nothing, Have been traveling to Vienna for nearly 15 years and have stayed in many different hotels in the 1st District This hotel is traditional with a v Viennese feel and has been modernized but they have retained traditional room keys a typical Viennese solution traditional and modern at the same time Also next to Vienna s English language cinema where you can still watch the Third Man on an almost daily basis 
392449,Das Opernring Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location to go to opera I was lucky to be assigned to a room with Opera House view Staff was very friendly and room was spacious Definitely go back to this hotel when I stay in Vienna next time

392455,Das Opernring Hotel, The room was just beyond the dining room wall Too noisy in the mornings , Excellent location opposite the Opera near public transport etc Very kind friendly smiling helpful staff Very good breakfast
392456,Das Opernring Hotel, The location of some rooms was above a club and having the mezzanine level room above that club we could hear the music as well as outside conversations from the time things got going about 11 pm until almost 3 am , Overall the property location within the the city was excellent and the front desk was outstanding 
392457,Das Opernring Hotel, Some noise from outside though I usually take earplugs with me to hotels anyway The third floor rooms might not be very convenient as they sort of open to and are adjacent to the breakfast room where no doubt staff starts preparations early and people might arrive to eat from 7 am when breakfast starts I was lucky to get a room on the 2nd but I still heard some coming and going from above after I woke up Again earplugs so there was no actual annoyance for me , The location the friendly staff the elegant yet relaxing breakfast experience in a nice light room facing the Ring with classical music played in the background with one staff member constantly taking care of the food and tables but not at all in an intruding manner The nice room with the amenties provided Overall very good value for the money

392459,Das Opernring Hotel, I ate one night in the associated restaurant and although the food was good I wasn t made to feel very welcome , Reception staff were exceptionally welcoming Breakfast was really good the addition of sparkling wine was a nice touch and view of the opera house from the breakfast room added to the experience
392460,Das Opernring Hotel, Rooms facing the street are noisy but this is downtown , Very good location nearby Opera house Some minutes by walk the k rtner street malriahilfer street Stephansdom Hofburg Albertina Museum quarter Naschmarkt etc The staff are very friendly 
392461,Das Opernring Hotel, The curtain rail fell down when i went out the evening So it was a surpirse when i arrived back It wasn t a big problem although it compromised privacy The hotel however responded swiftly the next day to the problem , Big spacious rooms with all the necessary amenities The staff were helpful and the breakfast was a good spread The room was also quiet as requested 
392462,Das Opernring Hotel, The only thing that maybe was not according to my expectations was the lobby the reception When one sees the lobby one might think that the hotel does not deserve all the positive evaluations which is not true , Friendly and always positive staff Excellent location 5 minutes from Hofburg Breakfast was great but also the venue where the breakfast is served with a wonderful view on the city is also very nice Warm rooms comfortable bed big bathroom 
392463,Das Opernring Hotel, 1 The entrance looks a bit run down for a 4 star hotel It looked a bit like a construction site 2 The bar is closed on Sundays and Mondays 3 The large walls in the room could do with more decoration or artwork , 1 Fantastic staff especially front office manager Harald who noted in my booking comments that I needed a desk to work on and immediately upgraded my room category to make that possible 2 The location almost opposite the Opera is unbeatable 3 Excellent breakfast available to 11 00 is a big plus 4 Room size is quite large for Vienna with a modern bathroom 5 Outstanding value for money
392464,Das Opernring Hotel, We almost didn t sleep due to the noice from the music and shouting of people coming of the night bar nearby, In the center perfect location nice staff
392465,Das Opernring Hotel, view on back alley disproportionate measures of the room, kind staff clean building with character beautiful breakfast space with view on the opera 
392466,Das Opernring Hotel,No Negative, It is a small hotel and the staff soon know who you are and were very helpful The breakfast room was beautiful and the food excellent The entrance and lobby don t give a good idea of how nice the rest of the hotel is My room was huge and my only grumble that it was too echo y and would have benefitted from more pictures or hangings on the walls I understand why it is easier not to have a carpeted floor 
392467,Das Opernring Hotel, If visiting over the weekend there is a night club in the basement which can be a bit noisy, The most brilliant feature of this hotel is Harold who met us on arrival His knowledge and wit made our stay fantastic The location is perfect for sightseeing shopping etc
392468,Das Opernring Hotel,No Negative, Staff is very kind and helpful thank you Harald for making our stay at Das Operring Hotel very special Your readiness to help and assitance with the booking many thanks for the complimentary room upgrade and all the tips about what to do restaurants bookings and beyond have made our visit really enjoyable and pleasant And location of the hotel is what you need by foot to major Vienna city center attractions and access to public transport

392475,Das Opernring Hotel, The room did not have A C and the heat was extreme during those days in Vienna But it does have a fan , Location was great just a couple of steps to the subway which offers fast connections to every part of the city The main sights of Vienna such as Stephansdom Hofburg Palace etc are all within walking distance though The staff was very helpful and polite and made us feel comfortable We even got a free upgrade to a junior suite which was great The breakfast was good and everything was fresh but we d like it to be more various Another positive thing is that they accept pets so you don t need to worry about them 
392476,Das Opernring Hotel, There is a night club in the hotel basement and we could hear the music all through the night in our room which was on the mezzanine floor It wasn t very loud but audible nevertheless , The situation was superb close to everything Easy to reach from the airport CAT subway

392478,Das Opernring Hotel, No airconditioner But the staff were friendly they provide us with two fans for each room, I stayed in several hotel in austria I didnt find friendly staff as the staff in this hotel The way they welcome us and say good bye makes us want to visit this hotel again The toitel is very clean The room is well desgin And the location is perfect
