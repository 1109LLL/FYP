427904,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, Nice room and good bed However the integrated bathroom makes you feel somehow exposed when showering , Located by Belvedere Palace and gardens is a modern hotel that provides a pleasant experience Good breakfast We enjoyed a map of the city at the entrance of the hotel that helped for planning the day and to make a wrap up when returning 
427905,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, Free wifi was unusable like dial up from 20 years ago Breakfast buffet had a lot of choice but eggs sausage and bacon were all cold Bacon was so overcooked that it more resembled old leather Fridge in the bedroom didnt work light was on but not cold very noisy airco fan in bedroom, Staff were very friendly and helpful room was big and comfortable Large bathroom and very comfy bed Also very good soundproofing Iron and ironing board were very good 
427906,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, The breakfast could be better if they have more selection Also they could put little sign in both German and English to know what s in the food or what type is it Bathroom was bit noise if someone sleeping and the other person using the bathroom or wishing his her hands face or teeth, Very friendly employees And lovely warm place to stay with someone special 
427907,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, The first room I got smelled too much to tobacco I asked for a change that they had no problem to do but the cleaning services should take care of these things , Very nice executive type rooms Spacious and quite clean 
427908,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, Bed was very soft Not good after long walking day , Great location 7 10 min walking to opera 20 min from airport 500 m from station 5 min by foot to citybike station Super breakfast Good housekeeping Silence rooms
427909,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, No tea making facilities in the room Couldn t find the hamman bath , Nice varied breakfast comfortable bed and pillows and modern modular room Easy transport into the city centre with station only a short walk away 5mins 
427910,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, Contra The room had no private bathroom but instead shower and sink were right next to the bed Heating with infrared lamp In the promoted Castle Belvedere View room one could not see Castle Belvedere Lazy room servcie my room was tidied up not before 3 00 PM no second shower gel or shoe cleaning was supplied Unfriendly and time consuming staff at the reception except the Manager who did bother with my complaints Altogether OK but lesser value than expected and promoted , PRO Close to Rennweg Station with good Connection to Airport Good Sauna and Wellness area nice bedclothes 
427911,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere,No Negative, Rooms were large extremely comfy with all amenities Nice bar with range of cocktails Great breakfast Reception allowed for an early check in for a extra 10 euros per night which included an upgrade Not too far from the old city 20 min walk
427912,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, The main disadvantage is that the room doesn t have the solid door to the shower and the sink is the part of the bedroom so get prepaired to some noises made by the partner But generally it s a small inconveniece , We especially liked the reception service very fast and attentive to our needs The first night we spent in the room just above the restaurant s kitchen and it was terribly noisy at night and in early morning We asked to change the room and the rest of the stay we peacefully slept on the upper floor The location is rather close to the center but if you mind walking 10 15 mins take the tram 
427913,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, No door for the bath to isolate completely from the wind air con when taking a bath , The room design space and decoration The equipments of the room The hotel was nice and cosy 
427914,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, My biggest disappointment was the steam sauna which was nearly cold and stank like a pile of rotting wet towels Entering there would mean asking for a nasty fungal infection It also took me by surprise that the wellness Ruheraum chillout room was very very cold on some days you are probably supposed to lie down in your winter jacket right out of sauna There is also too much light This area has great potential to become an attractive wellnes center too bad it seems that nobody cares , The hotel is overall nice feels bit impersonal ok rooms and above average breakfast I HIGHLY appreciate that the hotel GYM has at least basic free weight dumbell set adjustable gym bench and gym mats which allows for a basic workout Also the finnish sauna is good provides some relax after long working day 
427915,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, When we came to the hotel the receptionist was unpleasant and unprofessional but all the problems were solved and we had nice stay Breakfast was good but it could be better Parking is really expensive , The location was really good close to the city center 15min walking distance Sauna was nice and relaxing everything was clean 
427916,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, we have received a room for handicapped people right above the frequent street even though the garage was nearly empty for extra 27E furthermore I ordered room with 1 double bed instead of 2 single beds and explicitly write this in my order confirmation and still we had 2 single beds For the first time I was very unhappy with my accommodation and I would definitely not recommend this hotel It was worth half the price maybe less not 180 euros for a night , The breakfast was good
427917,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere,No Negative, Good clean hotel very comfortable room Generous sized shower unit with separate toilet room Modern business type hotel Close to Rennweg S bahn transport hub and tram stops 
427918,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, We asked for twin beds and we got king size it was 2 singles pushed together with separate duvets so worked out fine We didn t have any tea coffee making facilities in the room which I consider to be a basic requirement for a hotel room , The bed was comfortable room had a good view next to Belvedere gardens 
427919,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, In booking com they didn t mention that I had to deposit 50 with the total amount of payment , I like the location and the breakfast of the hotel
427920,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, When arriving they did not have a room I requested with a king size bed but instead only a twin room They offered to push the beds together but that is not the point Pillows are extremely thin and soft so you literally need 3 pillows to be even remotely comfortable Breakfast is sub standard for a 4 star hotel with only 3 kinds of cereal and un edible eggs There we no toillettries in the bathroom and you had to call to have those brought to you Tea coffee facilities are not standard in the room and must be paid for additionally Rooms facing Renweg street are very noisy and you can t sleep with a window open which is why I requested a quiet room but when I arrived there were none available , Hotel is within walking distance of main tourist sights although it is a 20 minute walk 
427921,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, Everything was too expensive The cafe opposite the hotel had big breakfast for half the price of hotel breakfast The room was not 100 clean and looked used , The room was spacious and we loved the armchair The hotel was just 20 minutes walk from the old town The staff was nice and they let us park our car there even few hours after check out 
427922,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere,No Negative, Friendly and very knowledgeable staff Room very quiet even though above the street and tram line The children say the best part was the bed even the sofa bed was comfy 
427923,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, The gym equipment was not maintained the bike squeaked A light above the minibar flickered The room was not very big and the air conditioning came on automatically when we left the room we visited in summer which wasted a lot of power and was way too cold , We loved the view from the gym sauna area on the top floor The bed was comfortable and the room was well equipped and tastefully decorated Staff were helpful and friendly and the location was terrific 
427924,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, The washstand was blocked the soap dispenser didn t work maybe too full the ledge where the hairdryer was was full of dust We also would have liked to have shower caps On Sunday the room was not done when we returned late p m We needed meals in the hotel as I couldn t walk much but weekends are bad for that and in that neighborhood all restaurants are closed at that time so we had to have a meal in the Renaissance hotel nearby , The room First Class was spacious and quiet good air conditioning good lighting 
427925,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, The fridge in room 705 wasn t very cold But this is extremely minor and takes nothing away , Perfect location for the airport train and a short walk to Vienna centre Amazing staff and service Reasonable price and extremely comfortable junior suite 
427926,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, My check in was the worst experience i have ever got while traveling abroad Person Egyptian nationality old man who has no respect to guests and i believe have a problem with other nationalities was very rude and not friendly at all Without any explanations asked about my credit card or debit card which i have provided both was returned back to me saying none of them works but just in a second i got a message from my bank that i been charge for an amount which even exceed my total bill for stay Without any apologies he replied back to me in a very rude way Next day i met the GM of hotel and she was very kind to help and apologies for her unprofessional staff , Hotel has a great location rooms are very spacious and clean well furnished Very close to city center 10 min walking distance Next to Belverde Palace which has a great park to spend a nice relaxing time with your favorite ice cream 
427927,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, dirty walls in the living room and in the bathroom some looked like people put their feet on the walls the shower wall mount was loose and it was impossible to adjust the height the furniture was chipped no mini bar no toiletries paid parking we asked for a quiet place but we got the opposite we could hear everyone around us all the slammed doors everything you have to pay for high speed internet, good location when it s not loud you can have a comfortable sleep as the beds are big and the pillows are nice the breakfast while overpriced is pretty good
427928,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, Poor smell in the room from carpet and air conditioner The air condition was leaking The hairdryer didn t work The towels were bad quality They supply with toiletries and bathrobe slippers on special request only No room breakfast service They charge EUR 3 plus something for 1 hour Internet access however the whole city is covered with free WiFi I find this unacceptable for four stars hotel Airport shuttle costs EUR 40 however 5 mins walk to train station and you can take a direct train to the airport for EUR 3 90 I will never ever stay in this hotel , Good location
427929,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, Sometimes we didn t get a refill of shampoo etc The bed was too soft and the pillows were useless I had to shove 2 pillows into one case just to get any support , The staff were friendly and helpful The free breakfast was awesome 
427930,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, i requested for an empty bowl to be brought to my room on 4th floor as my son wanted to eat some food i had carried with me i was told it will cost me 5 euros if someone were to come up to deliver it i was upset and i told them i just want to use it and NOT take it HOME, breakfast was good
427931,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, Were wasn t baby cot in the room although we asked for it in our booking form We got it only after our third quite serious request , Nice clean room good breakfast surprisingly long breakfast time 6 30 11 30 
427932,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, The junior suite 705 has only one window Rather expensive garage for 27E , Its a great value for money Good location Modern hotel Excelent breakfast Ask for a room into the Belvedere garden 
427933,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, We asked to book two rooms both with one large bed and one with extra bed As a result we got two rooms with two separate beds and there was no extra bed in the room where we asked to put it Why do we use this booking com form to give in advance some special requirements Other general impressions 1 The hotel blocks on your credit card not only the accomodation price but 50EUR security deposit per each day of your stay At check out the hotel withdraws accomodation plus extra expeneses parking bar minibar etc and unblocks the amount blocked at check in This can be an issue for guests from Ukraine as naks do not unblock these money immediately sometimes it takes up to 30 days Therefore it would be great if recpetion informs on this action prior to blocking the money 2 Poor wifi 3 No breakfast was included Breakfast at additional cost is overpriced 24EUR It is cheaper to eat at Salm Brau 4 Cold bathroom and extremely cold WC room 116 5 Minibar is empty no bathrobes and slippers 6 It is strange for the hotel like this but my towel had holes and was age worn 7 Bartender at the bar in the lobby was somewhere out of the bar all the time , Location is quite nice as it is very close to Belvedere and Salm Brau However it is about 10 15 minutes to walk to the Opera and Innerstadt The hotel has underground parking with special quest price 
427934,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, We almost missed our train because it took so long to check out There was only one person on reception who could do check outs the other was just a trainee and a very long line of people waiting to check out about 10 12 people waiting It took more than fifteen minutes just to hand in our key cards There was no one else available to check people out We had to rush to the station ,No Positive
427935,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, My room was near the cleaning office and I was somehow forced to wake up every morning at 5 30 6 am when the cleaning lady started her job and opened and closed the door I had to leave one night earlier although it was paid and no refund was allowed and check in in another hotel just to have some rest in the morning On the other hand no shower kit no tooth paste no slippers and bathrobe only if you paid extra though it is a 4 stars hotel , The location was good the room was clean 
427936,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, Some TV channels didn t work Light around the mirror didn t work No bathroom product apart from the soap dispenser at the sink and in the shower some conditioner and body lotion would have been great Not a lot of choice at the restaurant for dinner and it is only open in the evening A colleague was hungry when she arrived at noon they told her their restaurant was closed and that there were none around which is incorrect They made her a tiny sandwich for an expensive price The hotel is alright but it is nothing special , Nice comfortable room location was convenient for what I needed to do in Vienna 
427937,Lindner Hotel Am Belvedere, This was once a wonderful hotel but now it s a disaster Staff is unfriendly and unqualified the cleaning is terrible dust everywhere One evening we ve returned to the room just to discover bathrobes and used towels casually thrown on our suitcases The rooms are in poor condition Plus the information on the booking com doesn t match the reality It s said that the rooms are equipped with mini bars but they have removed them and now it s just a fridge in the room Also we ve booked a room with a king size bed instead we got 2 twin beds When we asked for a room that we ve booked they said that there is no such thing I say they must change the information on the web site otherwise it s just a fraud Overall very poor service It s really strange because this hotel was once a very nice place to stay ,No Positive
