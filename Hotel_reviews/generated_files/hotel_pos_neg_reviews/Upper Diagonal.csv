376416,Upper Diagonal, taxis in Barcelona are a major struggle to find Even taxis that are called take 15 30 min to arrive , Very helpful and friendly staff Hotel restaurant is great and open till late 
376417,Upper Diagonal,No Negative, Very close to metro station Maria Christina 5 min walk No need to change metro line to get to the city center Big shopping center with supermarket Encorte Englese just 5 min walk from hotel Touristic Barcelona bus stop near the metro station You can get tickets right in the bus 29 euro per person per 1 day Good hotel for this price 
376418,Upper Diagonal,No Negative, Modern boutique hotel with comforts upon our return from sight seeing expeditions Loved the quiet setting The front desk staff were our concierge staff Fantastic 
376419,Upper Diagonal, Limited choice at breakfast For example you can t order a croissant and coffee only I did have a coffee though which was delicious, Bed was very comfy
376420,Upper Diagonal,No Negative, The staff was among the friendliest I have ever experienced The room was very nice and clean The location is close to the technical university and a convenient metro ride from the center 
376421,Upper Diagonal, The hotel is a bit far off from the center 30 mins metro walk The hotel is located next to a public pool inside a big residence area which can be noisy in the afternoon , Breakfast is beyond excellent and in large portion always pick the Mediterraneo The hotel is clean and smells great Spacy bathroom The staff is extremely helpful 
376422,Upper Diagonal,No Negative, Large extremely comfortable rooms with super friendly and helpful staff and a great downstairs restaurant Would definitely stay again it was excellent 
376423,Upper Diagonal, The terrace was completely dirty and never cleaned during our stay very uncomfortable seats no view not worth paying extra Housekeeping is very loud and noisy Breakfast is only three selected menus you can choose from generally a mix of very sweet and very greasy food If you are staying there a couple of days it will make you sick and wanna skip it , 
376424,Upper Diagonal, Night rate was way too high for the hotel category I suppose this had to do with high season in the city at the moment Staff was not always super helpful especially during evening shift at the restaurant service was slow , Hotel was clean and room was nice and big Minibar prices were really reasonable Quality of food in restaurant was excellent Quiet neighborhood in Barcelona a bit far away from city center which was OK for me since I was there for business 
376425,Upper Diagonal, Improve a bit the communication with the taxi company since there was a small misunderstanding about our taxi order to the airport which finally showed up and managed to compensate the small delay with its arrival , Upper diagonal was an optimal choice for us and that were able to confirm when we reached the nice area of Pedralbes Far away from the very noisy part of Passeig de Garcia surrounded by green spaces and nearby the most beautiful part of the avenguda Diagonal this modern hotel situated on its upper side has lot to propose from the friendly and caring staff through the cleanliness of the areas going to its tapas and breakfasts we enjoyed everything except the fitness space as we covered a big part of the downtown by foot Special thanks and big kudos fort their professionalism to apologies for not knowing the names the lady from the reception who welcomed us on the first day and was of huge help with our boarding cards issue the sunny Spanish Canadian girl from the restaurant who challenged us to come back and confirm Barcelona s the best and last but not least the guy from the reception who never stopped worrying about our taxi until the latter arrived you were all amazing and you have everything to make a tourist come back Thank you 
376426,Upper Diagonal, Hotel is small with small rooms more of a motel than a hotel No buffet breakfast Located on a sideroad and not the main road Housekeeping not great frequently forget to replace water soap etc Facilities like gym restuarant bussimess centre are very limited Had a terrace where people from outside hotel come and sit and stay past midnight and being in 1st floor we hear everything which makes it hard to sleep Billed me 1 per tea bag which were located next to the kettle and free in most hotels Not sure why this hotel got a fabulous rating on Booking but thats what made me book it which I regreted , Staff helpful and friendly 
376427,Upper Diagonal, The huge balcony is a disaster It s been closed by something so you can not look outside from Balcony meanwhile the whole 20 depts of the flat beside the hotel can look into your balcony So you pay extra for a balcony without a view you see latterly nothing and on your left the whole building can look into your balcony so even sunbathing is not an option Shower became 1 big swimming pool drain was not working at all Breakfast is disaster a la carte with 3 options in which 1 option was not even available Crunchy waiter who hated his life I think If you want an additional coffee or drink you ll pay extra Cheese not even available you have to ask 3 times for it , Nice looking room
376428,Upper Diagonal,No Negative, The room was spacious and clean It is 5 mins walking to Maria Christina Metro station There is a super Market 2 mins walking Close to El corte ingles
376429,Upper Diagonal, The one way street configuration made it extremely difficult to get to the hotel The restaurant was over priced even by Barcelona standards , Room and staff were excellent
376430,Upper Diagonal, Small comment some balconies are at ground level and some people were climbing up fence to look over Need to keep patio doors shut when not using balcony , All the staff Reception and restaurant were outstanding deserve commendation Restaurant excellent Excellent choice of food caters well for vehetarians well priced Notably busy most of the time Shower excellent Good size rooms
376431,Upper Diagonal, Although I was disappointed it wasn t a buffet breakfast what we actually got was delicious and more than enough Especially the spanish omelette Yum Would have liked the coffee pods for the machine in the room to be included though please , The room was really comfortable really nice shower and bathroom It was only a short walk to the metro and we got a T10 ticket 10 trips for 10 euro All the staff we dealt with were really friendly and helpful 
376432,Upper Diagonal,No Negative, very nice and stylish rooms in a very quiet street and area good food also in it s restaurant for diner and for breakfast However the Hotel is quiet far away for shopping sightseeing and other activities 
376433,Upper Diagonal, WiFi was sometimes a bit slow but better than in other places, It was great I wasn t expected such a good place Definitely I will consider it for my next trip to Barcelona 
376434,Upper Diagonal, My room was street facing and right above the noisy restaurant so I had to close the window and use air condition , You can choose from three served breakfasts The Mediterranean which I ve ordered included a lot os cold dried meat and some sweet stuff More vegetables would be great 
376435,Upper Diagonal, Althogh it was not irritating but sometimes we could hear voices from corridor I mean it was not quite silent especially in the morning around 9 o clock , Staff talked in English fluently The room was really nice and clean and the view was lovely 
376436,Upper Diagonal, Nothing, Very very nice small hotel New facility Excellent staff Very clean Perfect for our short stay We were late arriving as our flight was delayed and the staff were still happy to see us even at 1 30am 
376437,Upper Diagonal, Location is a bit off the lively part of Barcelona not much around the hotel but on the way to the airport and to the congress centers Wifi did not work for the first night because a of fire alarm that was accidentally triggered , Very modern and new hotel in the posh residential part of Barcelona Nice bed nice bathroom even if a bit small 
376438,Upper Diagonal, As others have written the walls seem to be pretty thin and you can hear alot from other rooms Also with the exception of 1 staff member the lady who checked me in the staff were poor and uninterested This was far more pronounced with the breakfast staff , The Room was very nice clean and spacious Bed was great as was the shower Very nice to have 2 bottles of water for free and the aircon was also good quality
376439,Upper Diagonal, Nothing, Excellent quality hotel with friendly helpful staff Only 30 minutes to harbour by metro Good base for exploring Barcelona and ideal for Camp Nou to watch Barcelona FC play 
376440,Upper Diagonal, The heating in the room did not work very well and my room service order was mixed up so the food was cold when the drinks arrived, The hotel was beautiful and offered room service
376441,Upper Diagonal, Noise reduction neighbours can hear each other that s the only negative thing i could say about the hotel , The hotel is nice clean well taken care of really a positive experience 
376442,Upper Diagonal, Somebody to help with the luggage when a taxi arrives The room door was really difficult to push open , Stylish well thought decor nice area peaceful room very nice restaurant and smiling professional staff 
376443,Upper Diagonal, Room did not look as the One i ve booked online also requested a full bed and got 2single beds push ed together only a tea and a coffee bag that we drunk as we got in we stayed for 2days and they ve never been topped up , Food is good
376444,Upper Diagonal, 1 Small hotel the standard room is small 2 Difficult to walk with baby stroller from nearest metro station to hotel the road is going up but it s easy from the hotel to metro station, 1 Reception staff was very kind and helpful 2 very close to turistic bus station the blue line 
376445,Upper Diagonal, Only thing I d prefer to have some heaters outside the lounge for heavy smokers like us Hahaha , Stuff was so great so helpful always smiling and there for you to chitchat saying lovely hola s and buenas dias in the mornings Naomi we will never forget your lovely chats and wine recommendations Miriera you were the first one to welcome us to our rooms You told us your rooms are just like the ones you saw in the photos You were wrong They were even better We ll never forget you guys Thanks for such great service and hospitality One of best places to stay in Barcelona a little far away from the city noise But hey jump to Maria Cristina metro and you will conquer the Barcelona That station is really close to the hotel starbucks and great other places 
376446,Upper Diagonal, The price is too high considering the location 8 minutes walk to Metro station , The hotel is a modern one and seems new The room was big and very clean The bathroom is very modern with a large shower cabin and nice light The staff from the reception was very friendly and helped us with some advices on what to visit 
376447,Upper Diagonal, Hotel location wifi speed, Everything was exceptional Staff were so friendly and let you feel so comfortable The room was quite enough The bathroom was nice and spacious A heater and a coffee machine was available 
376448,Upper Diagonal, Expensive hotel in a good region but directly at loud road single room 160 per night Thin walls no carpet noise from neighbour rooms corridor very loud Terrace to the back without view wall but observable from all balconies in a 15 story high appartment house Only three fixed choices of breakfast no buffet at least they included fresh juice and fruit salad but limited portions Restaurant staff uninterested and unambitious men friendly women , Room bathroom very nice very modern Reception staff female restaurant staff very friendly Coffee and tea cooker in the room Wifi very fast Good A C
376449,Upper Diagonal, free wifi barely worked and the room service menu had little choice, The room was nice but much smaller than the photos and for 250 for two nights it didn t seem worth it The Wifi didn t work the entire stay so was quite frustrating 
376450,Upper Diagonal, The location is not the most convenient for visiting downtown Although 10 minutes walk from the subway with luggage became a great effort Also for the days we stayed it was kind of pricey , It is a nice small hotel with design nice bedroom and restroom 
376451,Upper Diagonal, Swipe cards lost their data a few times Would ve liked non decaf complimentary espresso pods happy to pay for extras but had to fight over first caffeinated pod with wife , Staff were exceptionally good massive thumbs up to Aleksey for all his tips and help Furnishings were excellent room was immaculate and the espresso pod machine surprisingly good 
376452,Upper Diagonal, Coffee capsules and tea was not filled up every day , Spacious modern bathroom nice bed and excellent Aircondition Very quiet I liked the room perfume and scent of bath products a lot 
376453,Upper Diagonal, The attitude of the staff is really dissatisfied I lost my wallet during my trip in Barcelona The staff forced me to clean the all bills on my second day actually I should check out and clean the bill on Friday But after they know I lost my wallet on Monday they told me I have to clean the all bills on Tuesday If not I have to move out asap I told hotel that my wallet lost because i was so desperate in this city by myself and I want to find my wallet asap However the hotel not only cannot provide support but also make me more hopeless , The food and facilitate all very good 
376454,Upper Diagonal, Quicker taxi service needed I waited 20 min for taxi to the airport Made us late , I like this place all the staff are super friendly and the bar is great 
376455,Upper Diagonal, Hotel is located in a nice area but it wasn t close to the centre of town I had to take cost 15 each time, I missed my breakfast I ve got charge for it does not matter my mistake
376456,Upper Diagonal, I was surprised to find that the bathroom didn t have a latch or lock Later it turned out this was a common feature across other hotels in Barcelona , Very nice minimalist theme across the hotel They knew I would be arriving and recognised me by my name Check in was super quick The room was clean and bright The choice in breakfast was nice The staff was understanding and made an effort to hunt for all things veg on a day I was not supposed to eat non veg Their set lunch menus are wholesome too The frontdesk staff helped me with taxi and good tips for getting around the city Umbrellas at the reception came handy on one day that was rainy And Gaudi s Finca G ell Entrada del Drac is just walking distance All in all very good professional and modern hotel Will be my choice I I ever return to Barca 
376457,Upper Diagonal, Some maintenance problems appeared in my room but they were all tackled with the specialist shortly , Breakfasts were awesome Personnel is friendly and helpful Metro station MariaCristina is in 5 minutes walk The citysightseing bus stop is also nearby

376459,Upper Diagonal, I really love the hotel it s the first time in a long time I gave a review to a hotel but this one deserve my time , The breakfast was great The ocation was ideal if you want to be away from the touristic area for us this fact was ideal 
376460,Upper Diagonal, the location is really safe for foreign travelers but a little bit far away to the central shopping area , staffs are all very nice room is clean and tidy very satisfied 
376461,Upper Diagonal, Building site next doorbut if you keep windows shut not disturbing at all happy happy happy all the way through, Extremely friendly staff welcoming and helpful The rooms are clean bathroom is nice and new the bed was comfortable There are a couple of quite and nice local restaurants worth trying pasta at La Tagliatelle and pizza in Farfelle Local cocktail bar is relaxing 10 mins away from the hotel Shopping centre also in walking distance porcelain museum in an increadible park is a must if you fancy a quick prayer pop in to Paroquee SanVincent de Sarria breathtaking 
376462,Upper Diagonal, I could hear voices from the hotel bar late at night while staying in my room on first floor , A new hotel so all the facilities functioned well Nice modern design Nice and kind staff Pretty good internet 
376463,Upper Diagonal, The location is my only issue with this hotel It is far enough to discourage a night out if you want to leave late metro closes at midnight It is a 20 30 min ride to the city center On the plus side you are not in tourist country so you get to see more of the locals Barcelona is a great city anyway Enjoy , Upper Diagonal was a nice small hotel It isn t too far from the metro and there are shopping centers nearby The facilities are modern the bathroom was especially impressive and was decorated with jet black slate and very spacious ironically there was no bath in our room The bed was comfortable and the staff more than happy to help if and when we had a question Our booking also gave us access to an exercise room not much equipment and an umbrella when it rained 
376464,Upper Diagonal, No vegetarian breakfast option we were charged same price for not having bacon sausage Should be reduced price or another vege option Coffee capsules in room chargeable a bit tight for 4 hotel at over 100 p n, Great for Camp Nou football Very friendly staff Clean fresh hotel Close to metro Big bath and powerful shower 
376465,Upper Diagonal, No breakfast buffet only limited a la carte However the three breakfast types continental Mediterranean or American where quite sufficient , Clean new hotel with helpful staff reasonably sized rooms good bathrooms functional fitness room
376466,Upper Diagonal, Espresso machine was very very slow took almost 15 minutes to make one coffee Water of the shower flooded a little around but by the space of the bathroom it didn t bother us I think the cleaning lady had a lot of work by this problem Location not really close to the center but with a metro you re in the centre in 15 minutes , Spacious room which was very clean Espresso machine Illy was available in the room Icecube maker available on every floor Very hygienic Spacious bathroom 
376467,Upper Diagonal,No Negative, An excellent Hotel I travel frequently for business and this is definitely a well run hotel with a superb restaurant A very helpful and friendly staff 
376468,Upper Diagonal, The restaurant Too much salt in all the food they prepare , Overall it s a good hotel much better than those located closer to the center Really worth staying 
376469,Upper Diagonal, Lack of bathroom amenities Lack of view , The bed was very very comfortable and big Very modern room and new furniture Good location Even though we never tried the breakfast menu there was a large selection Very helpful and joyful staff Very clean room 
376470,Upper Diagonal, delayed checkin but staff did their best and apologize maybe 10 times and we also got present Problem can always happen but it was solved in very proffesional way what we absolutely appreciate, location close to Camp Nou what was perfect for us
376471,Upper Diagonal, Breakfasts at order is really lost of time and gives very narrow choice Also rooms from street s side are noisy , Room and service were really good
376472,Upper Diagonal, Lets start with a price that I will remember as the biggest rip off in my life 1500 euros for 3 days and I get that An hour walk to Sagriada 10 minutes to the nearest metro station For that price I should have been set up in a penthouse view looking at the Sagrada instead of having to walk there for an hour Bad bad bad Oh you will be close to the airport if thats any consolation but why Barcelona is a beautiful city just not from that view And not in that hotel , Nothing except for the staff and would like them even better if they could have canceled my stay and refunded my hard earned money
