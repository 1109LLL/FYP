134406,TRYP Paris Op ra, Only minor things Decoration of the room was mostly brand new and modern but some of the finishing touches could have been better Couldn t close the bedroom door , Great location in an area with plenty of restaurants and a lively buzz Nice sized family room 
134407,TRYP Paris Op ra, Really small room Wifi and air conditioner didn t work for 3 days and the hotel staff didn t know when it was going to be fixed It was 30 C outside so it was a little uncomfortable to sleep without AC , Great location a lot of cafes on the boulevard and a metro station 5 steps away 
134408,TRYP Paris Op ra,No Negative, For a first timer in Paris the location couldn t be better Clean and chic hotel with smiling faces all around Best cafes restaurants small shops and aboce all metro is literally at your doorstep 
134409,TRYP Paris Op ra, Air con wasn t working in room 315 Also the rooms are not sound proof at all so you hear everything in all the other rooms doors being slammed in the early hours due to weight of them and inconsiderate guests, Free water and fruit on the first day of arrival Great location Staff were helpful on arrival and leaving baggage on final day 
134410,TRYP Paris Op ra, Really nice and tidy room was quite warm could have done with air conditioning but opening window did the trick, Great location Easy walking distance of most of paris s attractions Metro and taxi rank also right outside the front door 
134411,TRYP Paris Op ra, Room size and room service It was wierd we didn t use minibar but our own water and they took off glasses, Lokation breakfast and staff one of the best value for money

134416,TRYP Paris Op ra, I have ordered one room with two single beds but we got one room with one double bed Room was really small for two people We had just enough space to go around the bed Room was way too hot In the bath was very little space too You can hardly turn around yourself Very overpriced hotel for what it is Through the window in the room I saw in the bathroom of another guest It is a little bit creepy weird Just one small wardrobe in whole room Definitely it is not 4 star hotel except price The price is too high for what you get , Nice staff The location was great 
134417,TRYP Paris Op ra, I thought the breakfast was overpriced 20 Euros per person so I didn t take that , Great locations super comfortable literally right out side the Grand Boulevard station cute neighborhood within walking distance of a lot of iconic Paris Nice resturants close by Friendly and helpful staff 
134418,TRYP Paris Op ra, I booked for 2 separated single bed however hotel pushing me to have a 1 bed for 2 people They try to mention that the mistake is mine and there is no room like that However in 4 minutes they changed and decided to provide me the room that I booked Be careful with the reception ,No Positive

134421,TRYP Paris Op ra, Julian the reception front desk guy was SUPER RUDE and INCOMPETENT in his job When we check in we handed our passport to him he misplaced if for nearly an hour he then realized it was under the computer Shouted at us and accused us not giving him the passport When our passports emerged he throw us the room key instead of giving us the key NEVER ever stay in this hotel no CCTV Zero service , Near the Metro 
134422,TRYP Paris Op ra, Room is relatively small Open plan dining area serves a perfunctory breakfast Seek an upper room at the back to avoid the din of the local pubs Undergoing maintenance so shrouded in scaffolding and tarpaulins at the back , Great location and plenty going on in the immediate vicinity Friendly and helpful staff Comfortable bed with decent quality linen Fair value for money
