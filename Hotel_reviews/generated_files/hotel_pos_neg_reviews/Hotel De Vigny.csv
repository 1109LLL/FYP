257749,Hotel De Vigny, My suite was stunning once upon a time The furniture was showing its age with nicks scrapes frayed upholstery and scratches A table was on a tilt due to a cracked leg The jacuzzi i could not get to work It was truly old world lux style but it had seen better days An update would be nice but I was still quite comfortable due to the first rate amenities My biggest dislike was the dirty stained carpet It really needed a good deep cleaning , The staff was exceedingly friendly and helpful I was upgraded which was unexpected The view of the roof tops was so typically French Loved it 
257750,Hotel De Vigny, No bar and just BBC World TV channel Really poor checkout service with both my credit cards declined on their machine Both worked when tried at local ATM straight after I left , Location excellent and perfect air conditioning during hot weather 
257751,Hotel De Vigny, The staff dont help with luggage , I like the location and the staff were nice hotel needs to upgrade door keys and the should help customers with luggage
257752,Hotel De Vigny, No facilities wifi worked intermittently no public lobby general area to get a coffee or a drink or snack air con didnt work room was old dirty needed to be dusted cleaned new wall paper as old one was stained and ripped chair cover had blood rust on it overall dirty and gruby hotel , Unfortunately I didn t like much at all apart from the location The Hotel is old dated not very clean and overall i wouldn t rate it It is NOT 5 star i would give it 3 at best 
257753,Hotel De Vigny, It is 5 star yet no kettle or coffee machine was provided not even a bottle of water The water douch was leaking so when the water is turned on half of the water goes to the wall I could not enjoy shower The staff for the breakfast are hardly smile , The space and providing umbrella
257754,Hotel De Vigny, THERE IS NOTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS HOTEL TO BE ENTITLED AS 5 STAR BUILDING FACILITIES BREAKFAST NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A 3 STAR HOTEL I HAVE QUESTIONS IN MY MIND IF I MUST TRUST RATING OF BOOKING COM ANYMORE , ONLY LOCATION 
257755,Hotel De Vigny, Overpriced relatively poor breakfast at this price one would expect very good buffet not just basic one , Nicely decorated and well equipped rooms a bit larger then usual rooms in Paris Perfect location great Michelin star restaurant Price of room is adequate for this location in Paris 
257756,Hotel De Vigny, First of all the costumer services was so bad Rooms and hotel need a maintenance Some equipments in the rooms are not working such as fridge and the bell rings of room The th channels all in French language and no English or Arabic channels The prices of laundry services are to expensive however the cleaning services are bad and not good thanks, Cleaning services was not good some equipments in rooms are not working such as fridge room bell and no door holders the ac also is not working well The laundry prices are too hight and expensive Cleaning services was not good some equipments in rooms are not working such as fridge room bell and no door holders the ac also is not working well The laundry prices are too hight and expensive
257757,Hotel De Vigny, The fact that room didn t come with breakfast, Breakfast was a bit overpriced in my view Room didn t come with breakfast and i chose not to have breakfast there
257758,Hotel De Vigny, Nothing it was almost perftect, I really appreciated the management the whole staff their courtesy smiles on their faces and most of all felt like I was treated with a Hugh respect Thanks to all members whom are running this Hotel 
257759,Hotel De Vigny,No Negative, We were there for our 25th wedding anniversary The complimentary upgrade to a suite Champagne Macaroons were much appreciated Staff was excellent service was exceptional So dont let that small front desk bother you Michelin star restaurant beat my expectations Location is spot on Cant ask for more 
257760,Hotel De Vigny, I read other reviews and they all said the same thing this is not a 5 hotel I decided to judge for myself After a weekend stay I agree The welcome wasn t 5 nor was the overall service There were 2 staff members on the desk and that s all we saw They were polite which was nice but for over 200 a night I was expecting more We were shown to our rooms but no help with luggage etc We got to our room which was very clean and impressive Something that we weren t told beforehand nor upon arrival is that there is scaffolding up around the hotel exterior for the duration of our stay This was a bit annoying as the view is something that made me book this hotel There were no tea or coffee facilities either If this was advertised as a 3 hotel at a 3 price I d be over the moon It was however a 3 hotel at a 5 price I don t really write reviews but I felt this may be of some use to future guests if you re looking for a 5 hotel at a 5 price go with the big names That s what I think I ll do But hey it s only my opinion , We loved the location Central to everything and a quick easy walk to the metro and simple for taxis to find The vintage look of the room was quite nice also 
257761,Hotel De Vigny, Breakfast costs not clear on booking or when there , The staff were accommodating the location is very good The restaurant is great pricey but as you d expect as Michelin stared 
257762,Hotel De Vigny, This was a 5 star hotel probably 20 years ago and has not been updated since In my opinion it needs to lose one of it s stars or update The king size bed was 2 single beds pushed together The carpets were worn and in desperate need of replacing They provided shampoo but no conditioner and the hairdryer blew out cold air We left our room in to explore Paris in the afternoon on the second day we stayed I asked reception to organise the turning over of our room and additionally left out the door handle sign requesting so but it wasn t turned over when we returned later that night Overall very dissatisfied ,No Positive
257763,Hotel De Vigny, Would have been nice to have tea and coffe making facilities in room The downstairs was comfortable but a bar to get a drink would have been good Otherwise a great hotel , Location excellent Staff very helpful and the value for money was top drawer Room was spacious and clean Very comfortable I would recommend the hotel 
257764,Hotel De Vigny, nothing at all to complain but maybe a coffee making facility would have been good Noticed some smalll black marks on the carpet which were there from our last stay which by no means negated the cleanliness of the room but it being a suite if that too was ironed out would be great but on the whole we were very happy at the hotel de Vigny, Everything The room is fantastic and very comfortable Very warm homely a room that you always want to come back to enjoy The staff were very helpful and location is great and the hotel had attended to the earlier small techinical problem with the tv Will definitly go back
257765,Hotel De Vigny, Breakfast was over priced Toilet broke and we had to wait til the following day to be fixed, Amazing location Decor exactly what we wanted from a Parisian traditional hotel Michelin star restaurant in hotel was excellent Delicious food with impeccable service
257766,Hotel De Vigny, We had a car with us the valet went to get the car after we finished checkout and stayed away 20 minutes Next time they should send him for the car when check out starts and the car will be there are almost there when you are back , Very clean hotel Gorgeous room and bathroom Friendly staff Great restaurant attached to it
