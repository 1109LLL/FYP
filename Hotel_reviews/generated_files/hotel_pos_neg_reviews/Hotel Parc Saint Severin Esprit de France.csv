111119,Hotel Parc Saint Severin Esprit de France, The price was a little expensive , Jean Claude was incredibly helpful and charming and made our experience at the hotel delightful The beds were comfortable and the slippers were a nice touch The shower was also nice Ludovic was also extremely helpful organizing a taxi for my friend and I quickly and helped me purchase and print train tickets within minutes Exceptional customer service at this hotel 
111120,Hotel Parc Saint Severin Esprit de France, Parking nearest was full so had to park 20 mn walk away but dropped luggage at the hotel door before parking so not too bad, Very convenient friendly staff and good facilities
111121,Hotel Parc Saint Severin Esprit de France, A bit difficult to connect to hotel Wifi Breakfast was expensive given the many cafe options around , Great little modern boutique hotel conveniently located on the left bank near Ile de la Cite on a quiet corner away from the noise of major streets Short walk to Metro and tons of shops restaurants and cafes in St Germain Rooms were quiet large esp bathroom and comfortable with modern touches Housekeeping did a great job each day making up our room Friendly front desk staff available 24 7 Nice selection of TV channels for international guests 
111122,Hotel Parc Saint Severin Esprit de France, Rooms may be a little tiny but pretty romantic Parking is an issue , There are several areas in Paris where you can stay but latin quarter is probably one of the best Close to many landmarks shopping and restaurants I m staying there almost every time when in Paris 
111123,Hotel Parc Saint Severin Esprit de France, Nothing, This hotel is in an great location on the Left Bank but just a short walk over the bridge to Notre Dame Located in a quiet street but right near the intersection of Bvd Saint Germain and Bvd Saint Michel The Louvre and Musee d Orsay are within a comfortable 25 minute walk Lots of restaurants and bars nearby although many are very touristy The property appears to have been renovated recently and the facilities are very modern Whilst I know from looking at the rooms plan for the hotel that not all accommodations are created equal our room number 50 was extremely spacious and comfortable Rates on Booking com reasonable by expensive Paris standards Staff were excellent especially Carolina who worked hard to get us access to our room after an early morning arrival from Australia 
111124,Hotel Parc Saint Severin Esprit de France,No Negative, Great location for exploring the Latin Quarter and St Germain Lovely little hotel clean quiet and comfortable and we got a great discounted rate with a booking made the day before arrival

111126,Hotel Parc Saint Severin Esprit de France, Nothing It was perfect , The location was to die for The gorgeous decorations helpful staff wonderful shower my husband said it was the best hotel shower ever and comfortable bed made it perfection 
111127,Hotel Parc Saint Severin Esprit de France, Only watchout is with the location being so central you inevitably get nearby tourist trap restaurants that are either overpriced or average food We used the guidebook and recommendations from the hotel staff to find good restaurants , Brilliant location in central Paris near the Seine 2 lovely adjoining rooms perfect for a family with a view of the Saint Severin church Very helpful and friendly staff and very accommodating for children Clean and furnished to a good standard with a lovely Petit Prince gift for our little boy and chocolates for us Good big Monoprix nearby and some lovely restaurants although you have to work out which of the restaurants are tourist traps vs genuinely good French restaurants 
111128,Hotel Parc Saint Severin Esprit de France, Do not use the hotel s airport shuttle service The hotel reception promised us the journey would take 40 mins and advised us to leave 15 mins earlier at 8 45am in case of traffic We were on time at 8 45 but driver was late by about 25 mins Then driver arranged for another pickup midway through our journey where we had to wait another 15 mins The supposed 40min journey became 1h30min We did make it to the airport on time but we would have preferred to be early and not feel rushed which is why we woke up early in the first place You are better off taking an Uber or a taxi to avoid all these delays This may be the shuttle service s fault not the hotel s but the hotel reception should manage customer expectations better , Location was excellent Room was small but well appointed
111129,Hotel Parc Saint Severin Esprit de France,No Negative, Boutique classic in the heart of the vibrant Latin Quarter The staff were exceptional and so friendly polite and helpful Our room was well apointed and featured a beautiful little terrace overlooking Saint Severin The Pantheon and the classic roof tops of Paris Sitting on the terrace over Easter listening to the church bells ring out from Notre Dame was unforgettable The location was great close to so many wonderful sights yet it was quiet and peaceful at night There are lots of food options of all prices close by as well as parks and less touristy spots to enjoy I would highly recommend this lovely hotel we usually stay in an apartment when we have visited in the past but as we were only staying 5 days we decided on a hotel and we could not have been more pleased with our choice Loved it

111136,Hotel Parc Saint Severin Esprit de France, No one asked me in the 6 days if I was finding things satisfactory I have been in the hospitality business for 25 years Not good public relations Carpets very old and dirty outside my door I did not like the way the lights in my hall were on a sensor , I liked a couple people at the front desk and the cleaning people made up the bed just ecellent and the bedding was superb The buffet breakfast was wonderful The bathroom was lovely Clean as could be 
111137,Hotel Parc Saint Severin Esprit de France, Nil , The staff was amazing helpful and the location was perfect right in the centre but in the quiet area So close to the notre dame and walking distance from everywhere else Special thanks to Mr Jean Claude who was very helpful when we had a missing phone And Mr Ludovic when we were checking out

111143,Hotel Parc Saint Severin Esprit de France, I think it is a bit overpriced it is a very basic hotel not with many amedities , It has all what you need in a hotel location cleanliness comfort and free WIFI They were also kind enough to give me early check in 
111144,Hotel Parc Saint Severin Esprit de France, rooms are very small it is hard to move inside the room beds are very narrow and uncomfortable Lifts are to narrow You can not fit in to lift with 3 person , It is in the heart of Paris close to eveywhere there are several transport options transportation from charles de gaul airport is very easy with only one train you can directly reach to Hotel without expriencing Paris heavy traffic Rooms are very clean and has a good material quality Air condition is fine

111159,Hotel Parc Saint Severin Esprit de France, Unfortunately the area just outside the hotel which we thought would be a quiet church square was where groups of men stayed and played cards drank and had others meeting with them Loud and disruptive Several nights our family members had difficulty sleeping and staff had to call the police to deal with the groups Some concerns were even expressed by hotel staff , Wonderful staff and true Parisienne feeling in lovely rooms in very convenient location
