148617,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, the room was too small couldn t even walk around the bed no space to put the luggage inside the room and it became a obstacle to walk around lift is small couldn t fit our luggage in had 2 suitcases only felt more of a box and less of a hotel room , location was great nice landmarks near by restaurants within walking distance 
148618,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, There were a sauna for which we had to pay extra fees as we didn t see the facilities were extra when we were booking we couldn t afford them so there were nothing to do in the hotel , The room was too small for 2 persons We got another one more spacious however there was only one key The cleanning wasn t consistent because there was only one key the second day they couldn t clean the room and the third day I guess they forgot the room was occupied 
148619,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The room was incredibly small The room was not cleaned every day The toweles were not changed daily Coffee was not put in the room The receptionists were not nice to us Moreover the room was not ready on time at our arrival Not to mention the decorations show lack of taste We paid for 3 people but we only got slippers towels and gowns for only 2 people , Nothing Everything was awful 
148620,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris,No Negative, The design theme for the hotel is really well done It is all about champagne and even the sinks are in the shape of a champagne cork Someone must have had a lot of fun designing it all 
148621,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Only one small lift and used by house keeping so had to wait for a time to travel to the 5th floor Nespresso coffee machine in the room but no coffee pods offered Deluxe room but was very small ants in the bathroom in our last day I would not rate this hotel a 4 star and based on paying 200 per night exc breakfast I feel the bubbles hotel is over rated Far more other hotels in the Saint Germaine area to capture the same rate No parking which we knew at time of booking and 10 15 min walk to nearest car park , Friendly reception staff who gave us a complimentary bottle of their house champagne for my partner s birthday celebration 
148622,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, There was a rather restricted view out of the window but with all of Paris just steps away no biggie, Champagne chilling in the room as we arrived very stylish lobby We walked into our room and both went Wow The shower is large enough for two and the jacuzzi bath is just perfect 
148623,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The size of the room but this is Paris, The staff at the place are truly the best they are kind very helpful good English speaking and are extremely service oriented The location was wonderful 
148624,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Had to ask for basic things everyday shower gel coffee pods for machine bathrobes got email previously to ask if anything required said for 50th birthday would have liked a view nothing in fact the view out of only window was terrible 3 pipes and a white wall then 120 for champagne that was sitting waiting for you was bit cheeky I thought as no mention of price etc the jacuzzi in room didn t work either, Rooms decent size suite well laid out great location for restaurants and close to metro and seine for travel attractions
148625,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Bathroom was small though , The personal was friendly and helpfull and positive bed and the room itself was very comfertable Also hotel is really close to metro and 5 min walking to Notre Dame 
148626,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris,No Negative, Small but very comfortable hotel in the very center of Paris Very convenient location to explore the main tourist attractions and close to bus and metro stops Nice small bistro next door and many more cafes restaurants and small shops nearby Staff was very friendly and helpful 
148627,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, It was a big disapointment i booked a 4 star hotel vie booking com but sleept in kitchen smelly room The room was terribly and strongly smelling like spicy food cooked kitchen and plus it wad extremely small Unfortunately I lost my trust to booking com , Nothing was good only the location was good 
148628,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, It dissapointed us that it had a good rating in booking com there were several things we did not like 1 The bathroom smelled horrible at night i do not know if they had a plumbing problem 2 The air conditioner was not working 3 If you took a shower the entire bathroom floor would get wet so if you wanted to get ready afterwards or use the toilet there was no way of doing it without getting wet 4 They provide you with slippers the horrible thing about this is that they are very slippery in the bathroom my mom actually fell at her age this is extremely dangerous When we informed the receptionist she appolagized but not very interested in letting the client know that they would try and do something about that issue 5 The bedside table is almost a dolls bedside table it is super small mesures like 12 I would put mu bottle of water my mobile wi fi device and when i put my phone something would fall off you can see that on the picture I uploaded 6 They have 2 rooms outside the hotel they gave us one of those rooms so to get to the reception you would have to step outside to be able to get there the weather was very cold so this was vert uncomfortobale 7 There is practically no place to put your things in the bathroom nor in the bedroom For people staying more tham two days this can be quite annoying Not what we expected from the reviews nor what they offered We had very good experience in our other reservastions prior to this one it was just disspointing that our las stop for our vacation ended up in this place , The decoration is nice No doubt it is in a good area and location I think that they invested a lot on decoration and too little in the real comfort of the client
148629,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Claustrophobic because only window faceted a wall Was there a week had an espresso machine but very hard to get the coffee pods from the staff , The staff very friendly 
148630,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Need to include English breakfast tea in the room facilities as well, Quirky themed decor nice very clean and comfortable Bijoux paris hotel so Don t expect spacious 
148631,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris,No Negative, I adored this hotel Probably the most comfortable hotel bed I ve ever slept in The rooms and the decor in general were cute Yes the rooms are small but hotel space is crammed in Paris so one lives with it The staff were really nice and helpful The hotel has a wellness area which we didn t try out no time Excellent location and close to lots of restaurants and bars The breakfast was superb in my opinion the choice wasn t massive but excellent quality and it included smoked salmon yum although the tea selection wasn t good and my husband said the coffee was awful I d definitely stay there again 
148632,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The rooms were a bit small for a longer stay however most hotel rooms in Paris are a similar size , Excellent location Great value for money Really clean The staff were super helpful and couldn t do enough for us We had a brilliant week in Paris and would use this hotel again 
148633,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The room was smaller than I expected with little storage space Although very nicely finished , The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful It was a unique hotel with a special feel about it for a reasonable price 
148634,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris,No Negative, The bed was amazing and super comfortable Overall this place was perfect for our short stay The decorations made the hotel come to life and I loved the location being right in the middle of latin quarter 
148635,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The business rooms are extremely small Nowhere even to put the extra pillows when you like to sleep The breakfast can certainly be improved , Location is excellent Everything is renovated and clean 
148636,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, I had a problem with the heating in the room and froze immensely on the first night Unfortunately the person on guard was new and could not help more The following day they increased the intensity in my room and things were ok , The staff are very friendly And the location is great 
148637,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Impossibly small dark room Room was described as larger which was misleading and too small to even open my small case No top or desk area for small personal items There was only a shelf approximate size 6 inches depth , Nothing
148638,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, It is the tiniest hotel room I have ever been in It was cramped and at 171 per night it was vastly over priced Definitely NOT good value for money , The room was clean and the bed was comfortable 
148639,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris,No Negative, The staff went over and above to ensure my partner had a wonderful birthday weekend stay Thank you all We will definitely return Regards Amy Tuson
148640,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, My room was amazingly tiny and except for a bed everything was small I could use my laptop placed on the very small desk while sitting on the bed There was a tiny chair but not enough space to sit on it , Good location 2 min walk from Metro station and 8 min walk from RER station 
148641,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Even though specific facilities for children were lacking we had no expectation that there would be, Great boutique style hotel with fun champagne theme Whilst a boutique hotel I would recommend for families with one child as they have good triple rooms Although breakfast seems expensive at 22 euros it includes cereals hot food and champagne that you will not get at the local cafes 
148642,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, If you re mad enough to drive in Paris it s a little tricky to park outside , Fantastic hotel great location and exceptional staff The design is also really stylish 
148643,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Breakfast was a rip off 22 Euros no variety Restaurant across the road much better 12 5 Euros Room had no proper Study table , Staff her name started with L was too good Very helpful 
148644,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, small small small rooms no possibility to put your belongings We had a suite but we could barely turn around in the room , Very friendly staff nice hotel very stilish all in Champagne style 
148645,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The room was small with little storage but this is common in this area, Good location good transport links very clean and staff were very friendly and helpful I dont eat a huge breakfast so was pleased they offered coffee juice and croissant at a cheaper rate
148646,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Booking com says Genius have 2hrs early check in and 2hrs late check out but Hotel did not say the same standard times apply , Champagne all over the place Perfectly helpful and happy staff 
148647,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The only downside is that you can t really sit in the littl courtyard , The staff couldn t have Ben more helpful we arranged a surprise for my sister in law and they kept it quiet and helped make it s very special trip The rooms are very tastefully decorated and the champagne theme works well and isn t over done 
148648,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Omelette and bacon was finished and not refilled at breakfast , Champagne theme ALL over this Hotel Gives a lovely and very nice feeling Very helpful staff with a friendly happy and positive tone the whole stay Different Champagnes each day at breakfast was excellent 
148649,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Twin room should have been bigger it was more like a a room for a single person The room its self was very nice just not big enough for two people to move around comfortably , Staff were very nice hotel was well decorated good location 
148650,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The room was just to small size as we had a third person, The room is very unusual I would guess the owners did the design and there is a lot of attention to detail 
148651,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The Bath is tiny it was not big enough for my husband to have a bath It was an issue The shower was horrid too as it was not attached above in the bath so that we could have a decent shower which made things difficult for both of us It would have been nice to have a soap dish to put the soap in , The Hotel was Fab clean and nothing was too big or small for the Staff The BEST Staff in Paris that we have encountered ever Even though some things need improving we would recommend this Hotel in the blink of an eye and will definitely stay there again In fact we are looking at dates to return there 
148652,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Breakfast could have been included in the price , The room was very comfortable the bath and shower facilities were excellent and the staff were very helpful and friendly
148653,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, One day the room was cleaned very late after 3 pm Otherwise everything was clean and well looked after , Perfect location Every staff member was very attentive The room was cute comfy and quiet I would stay here again 
148654,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, I ve been in small hotel rooms before and what I expect in Paris but this room was small to the point of being uncomfortable Nowhere to put a suitcase one tiny shelf in the bathroom having to climb on the bed to close the window drapes it was ridiculous , Great location super clean and wonderful and helpful staff 
148655,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Room was too small to be sold as a triple room No space left for luggage after the third bed We had to rearrange the beds to make space for luggage losing the cabinet which also was not adequate for three ,No Positive
148656,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, no coffee facilities in room over priced not value for money no cold fridge was warm no english Television channels, Clean friendly well located
148657,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Room was too small with no desk space to sit with a small iPad laptop Closet was equally tiny , Interesting modern decoration around the concept of bubbles champagne 
148658,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Space in rooms and aisles was sharp but you can t really have it larger neither in a Paris building Covered parking for a larger car X6 is forcing you to park far away, The champagne theme was driven fully into the smallest details furniture of the hotel The staff was when comparing to average French standards exceptionally kind and helpful 
148659,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Our room seemed to have some electrical problems likely due to all of the fun decorations features that they added to the room For example the multitude of light switches for the bathroom seemed to have a different function each time they were used sometimes the lights would not even come on the jets for the bath tub did not work and the switch to raise and lower the television from the footboard of the bed did not work properly it would raise but not lower However this is not that different than one would expect from driving a French made car , The staff was very friendly responsive and provided a helpful concierge service The hotel was well decorated we enjoyed the champagne theme and very clean The location was excellent with close proximity to metro transit restaurants and tourist sites 
148660,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris,No Negative, This is a really lovely modern boutique hotel The staff are friendly and helpful but not at all intrusive The breakfasts are also very tasty with a good range of choices The rooms are quite small as other reviews say but very nicely decorated The beds are not small Do remember to ask if you need your bed to be made as a double we didn t realise at first that most rooms can be prepared as two singles or joined and prepared as one perfectly comfortable double 
148661,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The room is really small Hard even to open the luggage , Great Staff Helped us with anything we needed The location is awesome It s a calm neighborhood and everything is close to it 
148662,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Let s start from the beginning I asked the staff to provide me with a directions but instead of that I received an offer of using a shuttle bus for 60 EUR only nothing else When I arrived it turned out that the room was very small i understand that it s tricky to convert such an old building into a hotel but in this case the rooms should be arranged in a practical and funcitonal way Closet was to close to the bed so we couldn t open it properly In the bathroom except small shelf under the mirror there was no counter top or any other place where we could place our cosmetics or even soap The shelf in the shower cabin was very unstable and it will fall on someone s foot sooner or later I asked for two separate twin beds but it turned out that the twin beds were very narrow and in fact joined together so in fact it was one bed Immediately after arrival I told the reception that our pillows were stained and asked to replace them and I was assured that it would happen Instead of replacing cleaning service just put them the other side up I asked for additional towels because for two people we got only 2 towels Towels were delivered but they disappeared after few hours despite the fact that they weren t used and they were folded on the bed I guess cleaning service took them Breakfast was very bad I d expect a 4 star hotel to offer a range of hot breakfast meals Instead of that we were offered with non edible cold and dry scrumbled eggs and soaked bacon Person serving breakfast didn t speak English so it was difficult to communicate Corridors were constantly blocked by vacuum cleaners laundry laying on the floor or some other stuff In general the hotel is ok but it s not a 4 star standard, the main advantage of this hotel is the location very close to Notre Dame Louvre and to the Saint Michel station The neighbourhood is also lovely 
148663,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Door re bathroom, Everything Travelled as a group of friends but it would be the perfect couples hotel Amongst the most friendly staff ever I have ever dealt with at a hotel I travel a lot 
148664,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Its a hotel with a confused identity It is as the person who decided on the decoration of the hotel tried to put in all their ideas in a melting pot stir it over and over add a sprinkle of cheap and a little boudoir then let it over spill into a room or a lobby or a stair case , The staff were very friendly and the location is great 
148665,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, they advertise free sauna but they charge it 50 EUR if you book via booking I asked receptionist to show me price list with 50 EUR charge but they couldn t find it written anywhere but they kept insisting I have to pay breakfast is nothing special and the room where they serve it is very small , everything looks nice an clean great location 
148666,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Did request soya milk in advance of stay but had to supply my own , Velib station adjacent to hotel Location central but quiet and calm Supremely comfy bed Not an impersonal large branded hotel 
148667,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Small room but typical for Paris , Being a champagne lover I loved the champagne theme as well as the champagne in the mini bar the actual champagne bar and the barman knowledgeable about champagne But in addition to that the location was great a minute or so walk from Blvd Saint Germain and a convenient metro station The staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast was good and plentiful although some variety from day to day would have been nice Comfortable bed good wifi day spa And cleaner than I find most hotels to be and cleanliness is something I usually complain about Will definitely be back Loved it 
148668,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Rooms are far far too small Not even functional bedroom sizes I had to walk over the bed to get to the other side of the room , Nice decor lovely bathroom 
148669,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The room was kind of small but it s the same way for that price in any big city like Paris and NYC and besides so is not that bad after all, The location was great the staff was super friendly the room was amazing 
148670,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Rooms were slightly smaller than expected but were still comfortable Charges for the use of the spa only steam room and sauna were slightly excessive , The staff were extremely helpful and very friendly Rooms were clean and comfortable Everything was easily accessible 
148671,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Room we stayed in was entirely too small for two people We couldn t maneuver in the room with even the two small bags we had I would definitely upgrade to a larger room if I were to stay here again Breakfast looked good however too expensive Much more affordable breakfast any direction down the street , Location was excellent right down the street from our favorite restaurant in Paris Le Coup Chou Staff was friendly and helpful 
148672,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris,No Negative, What I mostly liked about this hotel was that they up graded us to a suite as we were celebrating our first wedding anniversary at no additional cost It was a beautiful room exactly and location of super 
148673,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The room I was in a superior and given its layout are impossible if you re staying for more than two nights and have a suitcase There s simply no room to maneouver the closet is just a half size space that won t even hold a suit , Good location if you need to be on the RER B Good wifi Nice new ly renovated clean boutique hotel Surprisingly spacious shower 
148674,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Drawers in the room would have been good The floor of the shower tray was dangerously slippery , Staff were great friendly helpful and efficient Location was terrific near so many great monuments and museums Clean and charming 
148675,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The room was a bit small but it was good for our trip anyway as we were out most of the day , The staff was very helpful and nice with everything The hotel send me an email in advance asking me of the specific wishes which was great as my boyfriend had birthday during our stay and they arranged champagne and a cake to the room on my request and delivered it exactly on time The SPA option was great too The room was facing the inner garden and was super quiet The location is great 3 min from the metro and very close to Notre Dame It s also close to many nice restaurants in the Latin Quarter 
148676,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris,No Negative, Location cleanliness renovated and up to date appearance email contact by the owner and friendliness of staff Would definitely consider staying again 
148677,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris,No Negative, Upgraded to an amazing deluxe room The decor is just gorgeous throughout such thought has gone into it Perfect location Very comfy bed A new favourite in Paris 
148678,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The hotel is absolutely not of 4 star quality bathroom not clean enough and smelly no daily refreshment of the rooms no room service basic lounge and eating area Staff is ok , The location is great nearby the louvre museum and the notre dame 
148679,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, nothing, lovely and sexy room with good design even if room is not big but kingsize bed is so good and comfortable location is great have many decilious restaurant around the hotel 
148680,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Bad smell in the room even if everything looked new and clean I believe the bad smell is due to bad plumbing work which does not prevent sewer gases leaking back to the air in the bathroom When person in the room upstairs takes a shower or flushes the toilet you hear a lot of noise through the pipes , Location Reception staff
148681,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Room was not cleaned until after 4 30pm so when we went back to our room to take an afternoon rest we had to wait in the bar for half an hour before we could go back to the room As pointed out in the other reviews the room was very very small they seem to have gone for style and not substance There are no leaflets about the attractions and when we asked about the opening time of Notre Dam cathedral they could not tell us and made no effort to find out either , the location
148682,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, did not enjoy this hotel at all too much plastic staff seemed tired and annoyed or bored Inattentive not comfortable in the room to work or no place in the communal area to relax or work breakfast was fruit salad seemed several days old I would not go back ,No Positive
148683,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The rooms are small but that is Paris standard I understand , Good location walking distance to main attractions We did not need to use public transportation The hop on hop off bus may be found nearby Very clean hotel Very friendly and helpful personnel We would stay here again based on this booking experience 
148684,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The wardrobes are very small The breakfast is poor and not worth what they re charging we required an adapter for temp use during our two days stay however they were keen to sell it for 12 rather than provide this service we required umbrellas to avoid heavy rain they couldn t provide , The location was very convenient walking distance from St Germain Street Notre Dame Cathedral and centre 
148685,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, I think you should get rid of the sequin pillows and sequin covers at the end of the bed Too much like Las Vegas And after all it s PARIS , Loved the new hotel so clean Sweet staff very helpful Loved the soft white duvet covers and sheets Shower room was also great as well as the expresso machine
148686,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The rooms were extremely small and we had a weird smell coming out of the shower We asked the front desk if they could look at it They said this was normal and that the housekeeping department opened the window We went in the room and the window wasn t open and the smell was still bad , The location of the hotel was great Super close to many must sees in Paris 
148687,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, At 22 euro per person breakfast was was too expensive so we didn t eat breakfast at the hotel Instead walked a few blocks for a croissant and coffee for about 3 euro per person Would be nice for this hotel to offer a lower cost option for a light breakfast Room was extremely small but understand that s pretty much the norm in Paris , Very helpful staff modern decor of the hotel pretty good location 
148688,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The hotel itself is nice with an original decoration but the rooms are incredibly small with insufficient space for luggage or shirts Not a great impression to keep your luggage on the bed and your shirts on the TV , Good location next to Sorbone University walking distance to the Pantheon Notre Dame and Saint Michel Boulevard 5 minutes walking to subway station 
148689,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, The room is really small , 1 Nice and helpful reception 2 Convenient location walking distance to le de la Cit and Panth on 3 Careful design everywhere reflecting the name bubbles 
148690,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Toilet separate from bathroom still inside our room Not much storage space , Location very close to two metro stops Within walking distance of a variety of restaurants Staff very friendly and accommodating large bed with ample size in room Extremely clean windows open so can use that for air or air conditioning if you prefer Wi Fi speedy

148694,Hotel Les Bulles De Paris, Bed was hard as a rock shower was a bathtub with a hand held so you had to hold it with one hand above your head set it down then soap up then pick it up and hold it above your head so much for fixed shower heads Room was very tiny If your going to have a room that tiny at least have a bed I can slide my bags under instead I have to climb over my bags to get to the bathroom They advertise spa but the facilities cost extra and the steam room didn t work We ran out of toilet paper and the maid didn t replace it we had to go ask for more Our key card didn t work twice we had to go to the front desk for a reprogram The elevator was to small could only hold max two people so when we were trying to leave we had to wait 4 trips because the elevator kept clogging to the top to pick up people first , The friendly staff
