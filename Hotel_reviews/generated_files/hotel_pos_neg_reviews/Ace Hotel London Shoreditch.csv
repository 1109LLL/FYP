25592,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Everything comes with a price tag There was no even complimentary water in the rooms Breakfast in Hoi Polloi was disappointing with coffee like cement and cold hollandaise on my eggs benedict Lots of style but missing substance If you like hip hotels in good neighbourhoods I d recommend the citizen M chain rather than Ace , Very comfortable bed and excellent location 
25593,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, There was a heavy downpour I had to queue and ask for an umbrella at reception instead of a doorman offering, Effective security staff on the front door after the hotel s party finished easily distinguishing hotel guests from clubbers
25594,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, I was woken up at 12 30am to a very loud piercing fire alarm The hotel was evacuated and had to stand in pyjamas outside for the next half hour I was asked how my stay was on departure I do understand they have to adhere to health and safety regulations however I did mention I was disappointed at being woken up so unexpectedly I did not think the staff member empathised too much and I felt it spoiled my stay as this is not a cheap hotel , I have stayed at ACE Palm Springs and loved it so thought I d check out ACE London as part of my stay in London On both arrival and departure the staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel is designed to a very high standard I booked a standard double room which was very comfortable and more importantly clean The bed linen was very good quality as was the bathroom and accessories facilities 
25595,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Despite being on the 6th floor the street noise was very loud and carried on throughout the night I felt that we were being sold to a lot most of the toiletries in the bathroom were for sale rather than being there to use There was also a tray of items all with a price list in the room It wasn t a cheap hotel so I felt some of these items would have been nice perks rather than added extras Also the rooftop bar has a private party when we were there so we couldn t enjoy it , The d cor of the room was great and very interesting quirky The bed was huge and very comfortable The view from the room was great and the window seat was perfect for people watching 
25596,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, This was billed as a luxury property which was why we booked it for our birthday trip However it is all looks and no substance Price lists were to be found in bathroom by kettle etc and very little was included in the expensive price for the rooms Whoever thought the metal cups were a good look obviously didn t try to make a hot drink and then burn their hand on the metal handle no spoons just silly wooden stirrers Bin and sheets only changed every three days For a luxury hotel it offered little more than a premier inn at a fraction of the price Very disappointed not what we wanted for a special occasion , This hotel looks good and is in a good location for exploring Shoreditch Brick Lane Spitalfields 
25597,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Bed is low and close to the floor and the mattress sank in at the end when you sat on it But still had good nights sleep , Exec Double Room clean and fresh with natural light cool decore vibe Located close to grocery stores a variety of restaurants and a reasonable walk to Liverpool Street buses to Stansted Airport and Train Station Easy access to wifi pay for view movies per day not per movie as some hotels offer Provided travel adaptor on request and quick to address any concerns we had 
25598,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, The Ace Hotel is nothing short of fabulous It oozes coolness and has an awesome vibe Located in the ever so trendy Shoreditch with loads of great pubs restaurants and shops close by We loved our stay here and will definitely be back 
25599,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, Great rooms with quirky decor spacious comfortable Very stylish hotel with friendly staff I liked the fact that it didn t feel like a classic hotel with the lovely cafe downstairs the rooftop restaurant it was a very social atmosphere The location is perfect 10 min walk from liverpool st station and loads to do in the area 
25600,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, I value comfort cleanliness and yes a bit of luxury over hipster cool The rooms are full of twee nonsense all of it for sale There s a pencil sharpener on the wall for some reason There are random bottles of liquor strewn about that you can purchase The minibar is in a little IKEA style wire box on a shelf My room had a giant Tumblr quote blazoned six feet high on the wall along with some sort of trendy photo collage It s all trying very hard to be cool To me it sort of felt like I was in a twenty five year old s messy apartment in Williamsburg I d prefer all of their little useless accoutrements be stuffed into a cabinet and leave the room looking a little more pristine rather than feeling like I m walking into someone else s see and be seen apartment where they re really obviously worried their Tindr date is going to judge them by the stuff they keep around The beds were on the floor for some reason which looks kinda hipster cool in a Japanese minimalism feng shui way but it s honestly not that convenient There was a vinyl record player in the room again for some reason no way to plug in any other kind of music from a phone or bluetooth and the record selection was abysmal with a few scratched off brand eighties non hits and absolutely no modern Norwegian black metal I d stay here again on work s dime for the location but if I was spending my own money I d want a bit more actual niceness and a bit less funky airbnb atmosphere for the amount I spent , The location is great right in the heart of Shoreditch walking distance to a train near a lot of fun bars and restaurants For a certain type of trendy person who values a hipster sense of cool above all else they d probably really like the style of this hotel The staff were perfectly friendly and helpful with the few questions I did have The beds and pillows were clean and comfortable 
25601,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, I was surprised that toiletries were not complimentary It isn t the cheapest hotel to stay at and it would feel more better value for money if there were some complimentary items , Spacious for 4 people sharing Ideal for chilling out in 
25602,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, The hotel is different from the usual that you would expect Contemporary furnishing eclectic decor that suits the modern person s taste Staff was friendly and helpful 
25603,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, It was very hot in London and the air conditioning kept returning to 28 degrees which I did tell the staff about just a bit hot that is all otherwise it was perfect , The staff particularly one person at the front desk were very helpful and when I told them that the heating would not turn off they waived my breakfast 
25604,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Not sure about the area felt a little vulnerable walking through Shoreditch at the end of the evening Plus its very irritating to be charged for a 7 bag of nuts that we didn t eat The in room snacks treats are really over the top I fully expect a premium on Mini Bar items but this was silly , Great sized family room 2 adults and 2 teenagers fitted in fine 
25605,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The confusion at checkout due to the mid handling by the receptionist, Apart from one particular receptionist the staff were very friendly and receptive 
25606,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, First floors must be a bit noisy at night I was lucky to be on the 5th very quite , Very modern and clean very hip experience also due to the crowd Great place to hang out day and night becomes a nightclub 
25607,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, Really loved my stay in this hotel Was exactly as described and staff were just lovely especially the security staff This is a very cool hotel that perfectly encapsulates the Shoreditch vibe Would highly recommend to anyone considering staying in this area 
25608,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, This hotel is verrrry popular so be prepared for a bumping reception area anytime you head downstairs , The bed is literally on the floor but it s sooo comfy you won t even mind The staff was amazing so thoughtful they sent up a piece of cake for my partner s birthday and happy to help us out when we had an issue with the aircon in our room 
25609,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, This place is first a hangout club concert venue It is second a hotel Loud music until 10 pm then fire alarm evacuated hotel at 12 30 Drunk concertgoer broke glass fire box Apparently happens often according to front desk staff If you want a good nights sleep this isn t the place Oh and there are rude bouncers And everything in the room is for sale I just didn t like the place ,No Positive
25610,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, We had an amazing couple of stays at Ace hotel last week and both times we were served by Damien at check in The hotel is great and the staff are all fantastic and really attentive and helpful Damien was particularly helpful and remembered us from the weekend when we arrived on Friday and he upgraded us to a deluxe room which was great We asked for restaurant recommendations and on Saturday night we took his advice and had an delicious dinner at the wonderful Sagardi restaurant thank you Damien 
25611,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, Great place for a weekend From the moment you walk into the lobby you feel right at home If your home is a very hip and stylish place where bikes and LPs are decoratively hanging on and off walls of course The staff is very friendly attentive and helpful be it at the reception or in the bar The rooms are small but cosy and come with a decent selection of records to play on your very own record player Bonus points for the Twin Shadows album It s surprisingly quiet in the rooms considering the buzzing energy of the neighborhood in the downstairs bar at times particularly on weekend nights 
25612,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The hotel s restaurant is not great for parents who can t hear what you re saying when there is loud music and can t see the menu because of the dim mood lighting It was as Friday evening though The rooms are a bit disappointingly small and uninspiring they had the Deluxe Room , Booked for my parent s 45 60yr olds stay in London Ace Hotel is extremely cool and hip Food is top notch and staff are super helpful The hotel foyer is bustling with life good people watching 
25613,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Although still sa tylish hotel it is starting to get a bit worn down and could need a refresh I ended up on 2nd floor and was kept awake by the loud bar music downstairs Gym is tiny too crowded in the mornings I didn t have breakfast but wanted to get a cappuccino in the caf It was the milkiest non foamy cappuccino I have had in my life , Comfortable bed and nice staff
25614,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Needs better ventilation in bathroom as mirror steams up Other mirror in dark area with bright lights not good for make up No plugs by the bed Mini bar things super expensive Not enough bathrobes, Comfy beds great staff lovely reception area for drinks 
25615,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, They forget to book my bike the first day so they give me two the next day Bad experience first but finally very fair , Possibility to rent a bike but you have to book one Full of Beautifull people
25616,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, No swimming pool, Super nice reception he helped me book a ticket when my credit card not working and only have cash A small bouldering wall in gym 
25617,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, I d wanted to stay at an Ace for awhile so my expectations were probably too high but still an enjoyable stay If you won t be spending much time in the hotel I m not sure it s worth the extra but if you are it d be a great choice , The location is great a short stroll to some of London s best bits The whole place is I hate to say it Hipster Luxe A whole bunch of fun little details Great vibe and the staff were helpful and friendly 
25618,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Unsure if gym use was included in the price Wish we were informed of this We could have asked though but chose not to , Visited during the heatwave 30 degrees Air con was very quiet and easy to use Shower was perfect and used 4times by each of us in 2 days Excellent to be able to have 4 people in one room too What a gem this place is Always plenty of staff friendly but not overbearing Lovely thank you 
25619,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, I liked everything Nothing here to complain about Great experience , This is a great super cool and artsy hotel conveniently located in London s West End It has great open spaces a great restaurant food was great and they have really good healthy items too as well as a coffee and light bites cafe a great space for computer geeks to hang out and work a fun 1st level bar and a great roof top bar The rooms are spacious comfortable and decorated in a fun style All of the staff is very friendly very helpful and professional Lots of other amenities are available also Walk out the door and you have a large selection of good restaurants pubs and shops I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here in this fun and good energy space and will stay here when in London again Highly recommend it 
25620,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Mini bar etc In the room very expensive Possibly more tea and coffee in the room as you only get 2 of each per day and at the price of the room per night seems a bit mean , Friendly and helpful staff Very clean Good location 
25621,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, I wasn t too hyped that I was in the wheelchair accessible room because all the amenities were oddly low And the security guard at night was rude and didn t believe I was staying there when I came back late from a bar The elevators take forever to call in the morning , The Ace Shoreditch is the best I love the vibe and the young culture There is so much to do in Shoreditch and the metro is easy to access The staff is great the beds are comfy and all the little knick knacks are so addicting The restaurant is insanely delicious the bar is always madly busy 
25622,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, The room was clean and modern the beds were very comfortable air conditioning was good keeping the room cool with 30 degree heat outside selling point for us was record player and selection on vinyl in our room Definitely an ace hotel 
25623,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The hotel offers a rooftop bar which during the afternoon was closed and then again in the evening for a private function No problem we thought there must be a bar elsewhere in the hotel to get a cold beer Yes there was a bar but it was closed , The aircon was effective on one of the warmest evening s of the year Room service was prompt
25624,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Dirty sofa stains all over it extremely noisy as if the windows were open resulting in little sleep very basic for the money even by London standards , Friendly and professional staff shower was amazing 
25625,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The noise level from the music on the ground floor the base was so loud in our room struggled to sleep till it stopped in the early hours of Saturday morning,No Positive
25626,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Nothing that I did not like , Just amazing staff bumped us up to a deluxe room and gave us 2 free drinks at the bar Best stay I ve had in my life 
25627,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Had a major issue with the air conditioning however they handled it well and fairly , Hotel was nice and hip Staff was really friendly and accomodating 
25628,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, All good , We loved our stay we were at an event in Old Spitalfields Market so very near by Loved the record player in our room hotel and room design were great really friendly and playful staff for breakfast with our little 5 yo thanks Tracey our cool french waitress May have to be my business stay of choice from now on 
25629,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, As I was travelling alone the restaurant felt too intimidating to go in alone that s probably just me though In the morning at checkout at 8 15 there was a huge queue so more support at reception at peak times would have been better as I was late for a conference , Was upgraded to a suite and was asked whether I wanted to wake up to sun or have a more shaded rear room which was a nice touch Staff at reception were really friendly and couldn t do enough to assist The room itself is really quirky with a large corner sofa and television and the interior d cor was similar to a really cool musician s hipster s loft complete with guitar Instagram worthy photo ops all over the place here Downstairs a DJ was playing vinyl this is just a really cool place to hang out 
25630,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, Booked just the one night as we were attending the Depeche Mode gig at the nearby Olympic Park Stadium Ace is just a couple of tube stops from Euston station and in a great location for famous markets short walk to Old Spitalfields Brick Lane Friendly staff and everything you ll need on hand Amazingly stocked mini bar and other snacks etc Modern eye catching design Mix up with overcharging sorted very quickly with no hassle 
25631,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, Ace is a great place Stayed at Ace in NYC some time ago and love the atmosphere Comparing the two the location in Shoreditch is better but equal good service and personal touch on the room design Appreciated a lot to find a guitar in my room 
25632,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Bed on floor Too low Staff screwed up rooms and billing Its was a mess from start to finish Room still not ready at 5 30pm Tried to overcharge for additional mystery room Reservations all messed up even though we rang every day to confirm all was good for our clients They hated it and they travel a lot , Location
25633,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, It is an expensive place to stay like so many places in London but worth the price , Very cool place right in the middle of Shoreditch full of boutiques bars and restaurants Staff is super friendly Rooms are nice and big bed sleeps very very comfortable
25634,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The hotel can be recommended to 20 somethings who wants to party with other of the same age every night the ground floor is full of young hipsters either at a co working desk og chatting and drinking with friends This time there was a hen night in the lobby the rooms are loaded with alcohol Three times i have stayed at the hotel the fire alarm has gone off in the middle of the night A piercing sound Only in one other hotel has this happened to me SP34 in Copenhagen so i doubt its a rare incident We stayed in deluxe double The first room we were given had windows towards the street and was very noisy The second was peaceful but had just a narrow window out to the backyard Proper sound insulation and daylight conditions would improve a lot , An area with nice restaurants and shops Breakfast at the hotel restaurant is very nice though a bit expensive and the flowershop connected to the restaurant is amazing After staying here many times it would be good with a few fresh tunes from the string quartet in the week end though 
25635,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, The hotel is located right in the trendy Shoreditch precinct with many great bars restaurants and cafes only a stone throw away The hotel itself is very modern and great for people watching all the regulars coming in for a beer or bite to eat The music can be a bit loud at night in the downstairs bar but thats the sort of vibe I like 
25636,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The air con was broke and as the weather was warm it was incredibly uncomfortable The staff however were very helpful and we were told to use the minibar on the house as compensation We may have been able to ask for a room change but didn t actually ask as we liked the room apart from that , Brilliant location excellent service
25637,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, there was a mess and still is with two credit cards we used we needed the invoice and we still didn t receive the full refund to the card we used first, the location is great
25638,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, having to leave and come back to work, Right from the go you can tell this place is special Others need to take a lesson from Ace about customer service and how it should be done Staff are genuinely friendly and can t do enough for you The design of the hotel is amazing from the lobby bar chill area to the spacious rooms ours had digital radio record deck selection of vinyl Thank you everyone for a great birthday anniversary stay we can t wait to return 
25639,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Staff weren t helpful We paid a lot of money for our room and no information was given to us when checking in They told us no info about breakfast restaurants bars check out time etc Very un pleasant at reception The guy just took our money and told us we have to pay 150 deposit on card and if we didn t have card we would have to pay 300 in cash Makes no sense to have different amounts cash card We stayed from a Friday to Monday and we had to ring reception ourselves to find out why our room hadnt been cleaned in two days on the Sunday It was awful, Great location
25640,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The free WiFi is pretty bad and is not secure at all I kept getting warnings from my browser and basically could not use the free hotel WiFi , The rooms are very stylish and you see that the hotel put extra thought into the small details
25641,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, A very funky hotel albeit very busy in the bar area during the daytime with students using the free WiFi hence no seating available to use if you wanted a coffee or beer , Great location for exploring Brick Lane and Shoreditch in general Great fun to stay for a few days 
25642,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, I ve stayed here twice Last time we got turntables or guitars in the bedroom This time that was absent which was a shame The little details are what make hotels special which is why we wanted to stay here Also the room wasn t ready by 3 00 and we had to hang around which was a little disappointing , Good vibe friendly staff great breakfast
25643,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Nothing, Room was very original we had records and a record player very nice The personnel at the desk was very trendy and young but very helpful and friendly The location of the hotel is perfect when you arrive at London Stansted and you take a train to Liverpool Street Station just a 15 minute walk 
25644,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Tin mugs in room useless as become too hot to hold and to drink from when having tea and coffee Bath wasn t completely clean looked like blood stain near plug hole , Served its purpose for an overnight stay to attend a friend s party in the area 
25645,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, The service was amazing I was kindly given a free bottle of presecco as it was my 21st AND a token for 2 free beers from the bar The hotel staff were lovley and approachable and just made our first stay at the hotel 10 10 
25646,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, It s about 10 minutes walk to the nearest tube station It s a nice stroll when the weather is nice but it s not always a jolly after a long day walking in the windy and grey day , Nicely presented and unique decor room Very comfortable bed and clean bath room 
25647,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Staff General chaos Beds on floor People hanging around lobby nowhere to sit or drink, Terrible confusion about bookings Rooms still not ready at 5 30pm Tried to overcharge for additional days Badly trained staff Never again Embarrassed my clients with billing information Lost all information We had rung three times to check all was in place so no excuses
25648,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Quite noisy A lot of party kids at the hotel One night a girl threw up in front of the hotel Staff is hip but can be sassy Def expect to hear loud music and see a lot of drunk people on weekends , Hip atmosphere Big double beds Great restaurant 
25649,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, There are some rooms in this hotel that don t have good wi fi access hence I had to move rooms three times over 5 nights to find decent access to the internet Downstairs facilities are shared with local people using the hotel for hot desks leaving no room for paying guests I couldn t invite anyone to the hotel for a drink because you couldn t be guaranteed a seat Such a shame for a great looking hotel they just forgot to cater for their in house guests ,No Positive
25650,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, It felt like the downstairs nightclub was also playing in my room It might be good if you are planning on going out not much if you have plans the next day ,No Positive
25651,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The hotel lobby gets very full for most of the day night Problematic b c the wifi signal was weak in the room so I wanted to be able to sit down there to answer emails etc Not a deal breaker in my opinion but something to be aware of going in , Love the styling and comfort Beautiful room with an excellent view Great coffee and restaurant on site Good location very easy to get around town Staff was very accommodating and friendly 
25652,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Pity the photo booth wasn t working although it probably saved me lots of money , The configuration of the room was perfect I loved the large window seat The bathroom was huge for London I loved the relaxed style of the hotel Good when travelling with kids 
25653,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, It s a bit pricey, It s a really cool modern hotel in the heart of hip Shoreditch on good public transport routes and with plenty of restaurants nearby
25654,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Nothing really although we didn t use many of the facilities as we were only there one night , Really comfy bed and blackout blinds ensured a great nights sleep Got the option at reception for a front or rear room we chose rear central London to keep noise to a minimum and it was nice and quiet Excellent styling and design throughout hotel made it an interesting and unique place to stay 
25655,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, staffs are friendly but not professional especially the check in out counter staffs Many products to be purchased were displayed in the room I got impression that finally there re very few amenities included Bathroom door was too heavy to open there s no ventilation in the bathroom so that it stayed hot and humid , beautiful interior design cozy restaurant and cafe good food nice location
25656,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, We stayed here the night before our wedding and just loved it Every member of staff was genuinely interesting to talk to and the room itself was an oasis of calm If it s all about the little details then ACE shines on those too Chewing gum in your room for a start Brilliant stay 
25657,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, When I moved rooms I forgot my headphones and it was not possible to find it again The issue was not the price but they were given to me by boyfriend and had a lot of sentimental value Very sad that in less than a day they were lost , The extra in the room like the guitar As some room are spacious it would be great to have like a yoga mattress for a morning stretch 
25658,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Room not ready on arrival but offered complimentary drink Had to call up for bath towels as they had forgotten then only delivered one rather than 2 Checkout at 12 but still had housekeeping knocking on door at 9am, Complimentary fizz for birthday with card really nice surprise Accoustic Guitar and turntable vinyl records in room Checkout at 12 Friendly staff Nice toiletries and bath robe
25659,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Staff at checkin were friendly but fairly useless we arrived before our room was ready and wouldn t be back till late 2am so wanted to have done everything there and then It took ages 20 25 mins for 2 rooms and 5 people in total to be checked in Then when we got back to the hotel at 2am none of it had been done so we had to go through the whole long winded process again and it wasn t much quicker the second time around No real apology offer to take bags to rooms etc Also no information about hotel where to get breakfast etc and guests don t get free entrance to the club nights in the basement so if you want to go you have to order tickets not even a discount offered as it s run by a promoter who rent the space from the hotel I assume Also sent out of the hotel and back in a side entrance when going for breakfast at Hotel restaurant it is open to public so accessible via the road as well as hotel only to see our friends come in the entrance from the hotel Not great service Poached eggs were like hard boiled eggs and once again the service was painfully slow Expected better , Cool venue great decor and fab location for everything in shoreditch Late checkout of midday was good also 
25660,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Service at breakfast was rather slow It takes a looong time to get a coffee there The lounge was rather noisy in the evening there was a party downstairs and we heard the music well up into our room Luckily it ended at a decent hour The hotel in general is stylish and at first glance beautifully designed but suffers from clich hipster empty headedness If you put an expensive rega turntable in every room you might consider not hooking it up to a speaker that sounds like a mobile phone Great for product placement I guess but I d have rather payed for something that contributes to the hotel experience I don t really feel the room was worth the money , Good location for nearby bars and restaurants Easily accessible Trendy and hip atmosphere Stands out among other London hotels 
25661,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Got a room on the 1st floor despite being told I would get one higher up and then the music from downstairs kept me up until after 1am Not ideal , Super stylish hotel as you d expect in the heart of Shoreditch Rooms are really well designed and equipped with lots of nice touches The coffee from the caf on the ground floor is excellent and the food from room service was delicious 
25662,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The information in the room wasn t very thorough I didn t see a room info pack or anything I could have been blind though and not seen it So didn t know much about where breakfast was or what time little things for that I was there filming a wedding in the Hotel and it was beautiful great job , Amazingly well designed hotel reall well thought out the rooms are amazingly beautiful nice touches everywhere The fact you can buy most of the stuff in the room is pretty cool 
25663,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Expected a little noise given location but as this is a hotel that doesn t stop and there was a private party on the roof terrace there was a little more noise than expected at night and was hard to switch off Also due to popularity couldn t get a seat or near the bar in the lobby so had to find somewhere near by for a quick drink pre dinner ,No Positive
25664,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Everything in the room is for sale which made me a little nervous to touch anything in case I was charged for it In the evening the DJ in the lobby could be heard throughout the hotel we were on 4th floor although the music did stop at 11pm , Amazingly cool hotel Really clean and well kept in a great location 
25665,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, It gets too crowdy and noisy at Saturdays evenings But rooms upstairs are quite quiet however, The place is really cool in everything from decor to attitude 
25666,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Very loud Not great food Pretentious people Bed very uncomfortable Lots of mistakes Wouldn t stay there again Will complain to booking com, Staff were ok 
25667,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The free wifi is an open network so not really that fast or safe Essentially rendering it useless The service at the front desk was very varied but mostly on the curt side We a young couple asked for a quiet room and were assigned a disabled geriatric room with a very inconveniently placed low sink for a 6 3 guy This joke was probably very popular with the clerks It wasn t a particularly busy weekend so they were bound to have other rooms too On top of this we were overcharged for the minibar only product consumed was a bottle of water 3 50 but was charged 10 50 So all in all the exoerience was a very mixed bag for a hotel that prides it self at being excellent in hospitality etc , The facilities of the room were excellent as was the location Our room was facing the inner courtyard so it was very quiet indeed which was preferred As stated by other reviewers the lobby turns into a nightclub at evenings which might be plus or a minus depending on the person 
25668,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, It would be nice if there was an option to have breakfast included because it was so good , The layout of the room is really cool and I liked the small touches
25669,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, This hotel is rated a 5 hotel and in my opnion it is not worth its 5 status , Very friendly staff spacious rooms located in a nice neighborhood 
25670,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, Amazing hotel such great value The staff went above and beyond for us The room was spotless and bed very comfortable Couldn t have been better 
25671,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, I like it busy but on Saturday night it took 30 mins to get drinks at the bar , Loved the modern decor they have kept true to Shoreditch and taken influence from the area Modern clean and top quality 
25672,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Lobby and coffee shop always too overloaded with people working on their computers I was never able to find space for work meetings with my local clients Had to go elsewhere for that , One of the best hotels I ve stayed in London Staff exceptionally helpful 
25673,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Just a bit of advice book dinner at the restaurant in advance as it can get busy the team were great though and managed to fit me in , This is a cool hotel that still maintains friendly customer service I had a large room so I m not sure if they all have this but I loved the turntable and collection of retro records to play The room was spacious and comfortable ACE hotels can be a bit too cool for school but these guys have kept the warm service I also like their communal spaces
25674,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, It turns in to a nightclub in the weekends but not in a bad way But it might be a bit shocking if you are not prepared for it , Lovely room Perfect Location Friendly staff Nice restaurant 
25675,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, The hotel was fabulous The staff were really friendly helpful the overall style of the hotel was very cool A nice laid back atmosphere loved the cocktails Would definitely return to this hotel on our next visit to London 
25676,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, However as the ground floor is open to the public there was never a spare lounge for guest hotels during the day and for that matter most of the night This was highly disappointing especially considering we were paying guests of the hotel, The cafe and restaurant and bar offering
25677,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, costly for what was offered I also hated that many times there would be no room available in the lounge for guest of the hotel, location and staff were excellent
25678,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, It took a little while to check in and check out but that s only because it was particularly busy at those times so I m being picky , This was my wedding weekend and when I checked into my room there was a bottle of bubbles and a lovely note from the staff Nothing was too much trouble and I really do think that this place is incredible value for money and I would definitely stay again The bed was massive the bathroom spotless and there s a terrific humour surrounding all the facilities which you can t help but smile at 
25679,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Everything in the room had a price even the treats in the bathroom If you don t see the price list then this could be misleading to some who may think they re complimentary , Comfy beds Great location 12 00 check out 
25680,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Deluxe room did not meet the pictures and therefore expectations of the room big differences in quality and size we were extremely disappointed Room was on the side of the street which is extremely loud during nights on the weekend as the hotel also kind of functions as a bar club Bathroom was not perfectly clean when we arrived Service was not good e g had to ask multiple times until we received a second test size sachet of body lotion you could expect two people to get two portions of body lotion though , Great location Cool design nice staff price for London and the location OK good shampoo conditioner provided 
25681,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Bring slippers with you they don t provide , Ace is a lovely concept staff are cool and friendly Location is excellent it s at the heart of the shoreditch scene Bar restaurant and cafe are the best in the area 
25682,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, I was charged 600 for a room and it was basic I also had to pay for a note pad which was a bit much The toiletries were very average I expected a lot more , I loved the extended check out I had to wait in London for the day and they let me check out at 4pm 
25683,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, Incredible dog friendly Your dog s even in the very good btw restaurant welcome The rooms are phenomenally cosy we literrally haven t left the room for 2 days 
25684,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Lots of options to purchase minibar items but few free inclusions only teabags and instant coffee , Lovely rooms large bathrooms comfortable beds Good location lively lobby if that s your thing but quiet and spacious rooms 
25685,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Got a note through the door on Saturday saying that the hotel were glad we d had a good night on Friday but if we could love thy neighbour and keep it down a notch We were in bed at midnight and had not even been noisy , The rooms were very cool nice decor etc Beds super comfy 
25686,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Price versus quality For this price you expect a bit more of a 5 star hotel You only pay for the room and a great concept everything else is to be paid for extra There was absolutely nothing complementary only the instant coffee and tea at the hotelroom I love to pay for a unique stay but this felt a bit over rated , The concept the furniture the people the atmosphere everything is 110 really hipster and cool Shoreditch Great breakfast friendly staff clean room The neighbourhood is vivid lot of nice restaurants concept stores and close to Underground city centre etc 
25687,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, My room wasn t cleaned over night as the cleaner arrived at 4pm when I was in the room instead of having cleaned it in the morning , Quick check in and modern rooms The lobby is great to have coffee work or get a drink in the evening 
25688,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Mattress, The only downside was actually the mattress It was uncomfortable Every other aspect of my stay was FAB U LOUS I picked ACE Shoreditch because of the location and the edgy comfortable details of the hotel My fellow traveller and I were quite pleased with the cleanliness friendliness of staff and lobby Totally coming back 
25689,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Check in was delayed by an hour from 2 until 3 which was inconvenient Either there s a problem resetting rooms or not getting guests out on time , Really fantastic room records if you want them great internet radio good magazine Very well detailed throughout

25692,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, the windows in the room are like plastic so all the smokers outside the bars in the street you can hear absolutely everything till the wee hours of the morning a party was on above my room till 11 30pm nothing anyone could do but the team gave me a free breaky so was a nice gesture for no sleep , Awesome team and love the buzz about this hotel
25693,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The check in a bit faster but everyone was helpful , The rooms were comfortable and we got a big room because we had our daughter with us It was modern chilled and very artsy In the Lobby there was a DJ at night and young people working in the Lobby all day long Nice vibe At night street could be noisy but we asked for a quiet room Nice helpful staff 
25694,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The hotel uses a different approach to that of a standard hotel and seems to cater to younger eclectic clientele E g The room was less than good with a bed on the floor I don t like my bed on the floor Billed as 5 star did not see this hotel as 5 star, The staff were friendly and helpful and the coffee bar and restaurant good
25695,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, I usually stay at the Ace a bit and I usually am pretty disappointed by the staff because they tend to get things wrong or they don t follow up etc At Ace LA they would forget to cancel my credit card guarantee even though I paid cash for those 3 weeks I was there At Ace London I sent two parcels to friends in China and the courier company couldn t get a hold of me because the hotel gave them the wrong email addy and thus everything was sent late Plus I got charged quite a bit for the international delivery too The Ace PDX was the best amongst the 3 in terms of service ,No Positive
25696,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, poor choice to eat for breckfast and diner for kids Lots off nois in the night by partying people Some signs to the hotel when leaving the subway would be nice , The bed was really very low to the ground not so easy for an older person
25697,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, Friendly welcome from the moment we walked through the door Our room was compact but very clean The whole ambience of this hotel was wonderful and our daughter had a fantastic 18th Birthday Staff were fantastic we plan to book again soon such a lovely hotel Thank You

25700,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, A hotel functioning purely on style and reputation rather than function and comfort Even then not sure an industrial crate counts as style An item used as shelving in the room Duvets thin and not warm I could hear the bar music and I was on the 4th Floor Street noise extremely loud sound proofing should be considered More like an over priced Travel Lodge with rowdy bar The plug box coming away from wall highlighted to staff but surely this should be noted by housekeeping not to have to be pointed out by a guest No free water in room ,No Positive
25701,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Bare minimum service e g had to collect own newspaper in the morning expected more for the price Room service food was tasty but not very hot Staff could not provide an aux cable for the radio this was later found in a less than obvious location which staff had not been able to point us to, Great location Great cocktails and friendly bar staff
25702,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Taxis booked at reception as were told by them that this was cheaper than black cab Each taxi was 10 more than the hotel quoted when we tried to pay the driver and the black cabs back were much cheaper each time , Rooms are a good size and shower was great Staff couldn t have been more helpful

25707,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Only slight quibble was that we had to wait 30 mins to check in to our room but it seemed as though lots of guests had turned up at 2pm on the dot to check in which on a Sunday I understand can be challenging , We loved every minute of our stay at The Ace both my partner I are both hoteliers and we were both seriously impressed Staff were all fantastic friendly and helpful which in that part of London is a credit to your establishment Facilities were spot on Travelling as a family with a new baby and our dog the hotel was super efficient and made our trip to London pretty easy We will certainly return and recommend 
25708,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The styling of the rooms was too Student accommodation for my taste I know it was all very deliberate and was styled this way but I like a little more of a Lux feel to my hotel rooms , Location and very friendly staff
25709,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, London is expensive and so are the room rates , This was one of the coolest hotels I ve ever been right in the middle of one of the coolest neighborhoods We had a really fantastic room with a sofa nice view good bed bathroom OK quiet Really excellent Staff in the bar and at the lobby super friendly always ready to help you The hotel s restaurant coffee corner and the lobby bar also attract a lot of non hotel guests so there is a very lively atmosphere Public transport busses stop in front of the hotel underground is 10 walking All around you find great restaurants bars shops markets 
25710,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Couldn t open the window being on the 1st floor facing the street , Everything was as amazing as expected The bed the bathroom toiletries cleanliness room service Best in town
25711,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Breakfast was very slow I gave up and used the coffee bar in the hotel instead which wasn t much better staff were very friendly but I was in a bit of a hurry , good position easy to check in etc
25712,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, no sleepers at room which is unexpectable in the four to five stars boutique hotel if I knew I would have brought them , atmosphere comfortable and lifstyle comcept 
25713,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, It was not clear enough how to get the room cleaned up it is not a complaine but maybe it helps if someone explanes it by check in All good great excellent , The staff the energy the design the loud outside the room quiet the location i felt home and same time loaded with good energy The attention to detail the positive feeling the helpfullness in extream the personalities the welcoming and to feel that you are happy i am there The doormen are giving you a happy welcome and a warm goodbye
25714,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, no suggestions, The room was small but perfectly adequate I didn t go to London to spend my time in a hotel room I loved having the optional products in a little basket in the bathroom great products that I was happy to purchase A lively happy place to stay in London 
25715,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The room was a bit like student halls but the kids loved that And on Saturday night it was very noisy outside late into the night The lobby was often very full of people using the free wifi and we couldn t always get a seat There was always good music playing in the bar but it was a bit noisy and we could hear it in our room We were 2 floors up and I d ask for a higher floor if I stayed again Room was a bit like a shop a lot of stuff in the room was for sale at exorbitant prices and we weren t sure what we could couldn t use without paying eg dressing gowns toiletries , Loved the location We had a very spacious room with 2 double beds and a great view of Shoreditch High Street We stayed with our teenage kids who loved the hotel as its very stylish and hipster The coffee in the lobby was delicious A more real lived in part of London than I have stayed in before Shoreditch is a great area with lots of great street markets cafes restaurants and bars I would recommend a visit to Boxpark Spitalfields Market and taking the Shoreditch Street Art Tour all nearby We had a great breakfast at The Breakfast Club and also at Trade The hotel is short ten minute walk to Liverpool St station underground 
25716,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The price is way too much for what you you actually get Having stayed at many hotels in London this is by far the most over priced Would recommend staying a premier inn instead of staying here Same quality different price , The staff were very nice 
25717,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Everyone I encountered seemed to really enjoy working here wanting to be of service Bus service is within 1 block My view street skyline was fantastic room was very spacious , My room was located on the 6th floor there is a disco on Fri Sat PM bring ear plugs Streets can also get frenetic at night can make getting to fro uncomfortable 
25718,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, We were slightly disappointed that we had to ask for supplies of towels and robes to be given in sufficient quantities we expected that housekeeping in a hotel of this standard would get this right Some people may think the road outside a little noisy maybe request a quiet room , The hotel was in a really good location and the atmosphere was great We enjoyed exploring the area around the hotel it was just a 10 minute walk from Spitalfields 10 mins from Old Street and Liverpool Street Stations and was surrounded by countless cool eateries and bars All tastes were catered for Overall though a great hotel in an ideal location 
25719,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, I get this is a hotel that prides itself on being hipster central so I don t like being treated as an inconvenience but can accept it as a peculiar charm But surly staff who are also incapable of arranging simple tasks without being asked multiple times That stops being charming and starts being annoying very quickly Oh and I love the fact that the rooms come with a turntable but the choice of vinyl to play is poor Think a bad charity shop in 1987 , The hotel is wonderfully quirky There s loads of beautiful modern design flourishes throughout and a real attention to detail in even the smallest things from a magnetic panel on the front door so you can attach notes and the do not disturb notice right to a tissue dispenser with a witty verse on it 
25720,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The breakfast was cold and only one set of cutlery but room service soon brought up another Though breakfast was very expensive , The deluxe room with record player was very good and the bed very comfy 
25721,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Nothing I had a fantastic time , Very nice service that went above and beyond starting with the doorman and through all the staff at the hotel Ambience was great and the room was very well appointed 
25722,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, There were three of us staying in the room two king size beds and only two towels were provided Also the shampoo conditioner body wash bottles provided didn t work properly which was really frustrating I don t think that the hotel was worth the money we paid it was very expensive for just one night and it was an average room The room service prices were also a bit steep a brown paper file for 12 A pot noodle for 2 50 painkillers for 3 50 Maybe I am just not used to gentrified London prices but I felt very ripped off I probably wouldn t stay here again unfortunately , The location was good within walking distance of Brick Lane and all the bars shops etc The lady on reception was very friendly when we checked in and sent a bottle of fizz up to our room when she found out it was my birthday which was really nice The room was clean and functional and the record player was a nice touch 
25723,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Room was a little stuffy so would of been nice to be able to open the window Only 1 type of larger avalible from the bar, Comfy beds rooms were spotless good location good coffee 
25724,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The bathroom towels and robes smelled like cigarette smoke The rooms were supposed to be non smoking but there were clearly patries going on and the non smoking rule was not being policed The wifi didnt work for the first few hours The room was full of useless hotel merchandise for sale at ridiculous prices which I found a bit offensive Every little thing cost extra , Location was great Staff were friendly and courteous 
25725,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Lobby area is always packed with non hotel guests I was a bit annoyed at the beginning but soon figured out that it is not a lobby but a cafe bar Once you get used to it you will enjoy it The room is just compact size to fit in and it is packed with many interesting items quite pricy though , It is located in the heart of London East Very hip design and vibrant atmosphere fit for younger guests This hotel is perfect for people fond with design and creative things 
25726,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Beds were too low to the ground didn t think the room was a superior in accordance with our booking Being on the first floor meant that we were very aware of noise from the ground floor late on in the night Room lacked two comfortable chairs very little surface area for my wife s makeup etc etc All the available extras water etc in the room were very expensive , Staff were good breakfast was good but fairly expensive Check in etc was easy and we were given a free drink as room not ready on time 
25727,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, This is a great hotel Our room was very clean quiet and comfortable and even had air conditioning Nice friendly staff The restaurant and coffee stand were very convenient 
25728,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Some of the mini bar products are quite expensive And some of the products in the room were alot of money , The rooms are well designed And the beds are big and comfortable 
25729,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, no fresh fruit in the rooms we had to wait 30min before we received or breakfast which was delicious and also great it s on order instead of a buffet but should arrive faster , the general look feel reception bar rooms the fact that you can order breakfast io a buffet
25730,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The lobby is more like a communal work hub night club loud music crowded and usually nowhere available to quietly entertain yourself or visitors The room is jammed with too much furniture not enough shelving for clothing you don t hang and a bathroom with no exhaust fan Having to squeeze through queues at the front door getting into night club beneath the hotel just to access the lobby NOT FOR ME Perhaps great for hipsters but not old hippies like us , Shoreditch is a great location and the room meets the basic requirements 
25731,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, A Only 1 member staff at reception at a busy Sunday check out time B It all seemed just too much for the Waiters waitresses in restaurant I m afraid the impression they all gave was rather glum inefficient and surprised to have to look after a large breakfast party that was booked well in advance , The Wedding Party we joined 
25732,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The bathroom is a bit small not ideal for me And the hotel does not provide slippers even upon request , Love the decoration and facilities of this hotel The record player and guitar in room is pretty good idea great location with bus stop to Holborn right across the street and tube just a minute walk Easy access to Liverpool Street and brick lane where all the cool shops and nice restaurants are located The bed is very comfortable and the mini bar provide quite a few different options 
25733,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Concierge male staff member was very rude disinterested on our arrival as was the staff member on our previous visit a year earlier Maybe a bad coincidence , Bed was very comfortable 
25734,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, my bedroom had a blurred window so I ended up feeling a bit claustrophobic, great atmostphere very good neighbourhood excellent music in the lobby
25735,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, So many things in the room to purchase we were a little afraid of using anything in case we were faced with an extortionate charge , Room was amazingly comfy and clean with such great quirky facilities Surrounded by such a wonderful area also 
25736,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Nothing, Everything fantastic hotel bed pillows shower mini bar it has a curly wurly in it breakfast in bed friendly welcoming staff 
25737,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Breakfast was a la carte and expensive for what it was , Room was comfortable and quiet even though the hotel is lively and has a club in the basement we liked the urban decor staff were friendly and helpful Close to lots of good bars 
25738,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Nothing , Ridiculously cool the bed was very comfy and the provisions in the room were excellent Location is superb right on the high street and close to top restaurants cocktail bars and only a 15 minute walk into the City for work 
25739,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Had a charge on my card after we stayed and I ve not seen an invoice to explain why Needs further investigation , Location is fantastic and the quad rooms are plenty spacious for a group of friends 
25740,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, friendly helpful staff everything was as announced clean comfortable bed many young people around kind of unformall but still professional atmosphere good place close to many nice shops bars and restaurants easy to go to very centre thanks to near bus stop and subway near far as well
25741,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, System failure meant we couldn t check in at 2pm We were only there one night so went out and was able to check in at 6pm , Staff nice room close to main Shoreditch attractions I e boxpark Brick lane pump house bars restUrants shops and markets 
25742,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The systems were down when we arrived so we couldn t check in for about an hour The staff were very helpful and friendly though and let us have a free drink while we waited Room service didn t have normal baked beans just bacon baked beans which was very annoying as vegetarian, The hotel was lovely so cool without trying too hard to be cool The staff were all so friendly and it s in a great location The rooms were really interesting and clean and big and the bed was huge
25743,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Only one lift was working the room was quite warm on arrival and upon checkout the system had gone down, Location was perfect right in the centre of Shoreditch The room was a great size and the bed was really comfortable 
25744,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Noisy at night making tea is a hassle as you have to put the kettle on the floor but dangerous really It s really for wealthy hipsters so didn t really suit me Not sure why I should have to pay a service charge when buying beer from the main bar and charging to my room One of two lifts not working when I was there , Centre of Shoreditch clean and friendliness of staff 
25745,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Too cool for school staff a little pretentious Mostly very nice though Long walk to Tube , Cool hotel nice and spacious rooms Good value for money 
25746,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, I didn t enjoy my Room service breakfast First morning I had chia seed Bircher dried fruit and almonds which was not a nice texture and I didn t like the dried fruit The next morning I had Poached eggs which were cold and thus disappointing I also wasn t informed about extra charges for room service, Very comfy delux bedroom great sheets and pillows nice shower and products Nice bar and hoi polloi restaurant
25747,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, Just love the place Great service nice cocktail range good simple food always something going on there or in the area like minded people around me and never any bad vibes I am a regular now 
25748,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, The hotel itself is really cool in an edgy location in London easy to go everywhere The bar and the restaurant is excellent especially for nights you don t wanna go out a drink in the hotel bar will be perfect The staffs are cool and helpful from Paris to London for a weekend this is THE place 
25749,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, the social spaces great that there is a scene but at some points almost so busy that it was impossible to find seating or have short meetings with our group This forced us back into our room for meetings which was unfortunate as the common space is so great , The staff really were great over and above as far as being friendly and accommodating 
25750,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Snacks and drinks should be much cheaper Staff could be better presented and more efficient , Bed was very comfy and shower and complementary products great quality 
25751,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The bar staff gave us a double without even asking Cheeky , The bed was comfy the staff was friendly and helpful the vibe is very happening There s always something going on 
25752,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, We had a room for three people and only had two towel sets When we called for extra towels it took nearly an hour for them to bring them up to the room on the 1st floor , The location and the hotel itself are great The restaurant of the hotel is also pretty good The menu is interesting and the staff interested and friendly but still amicable The flower store next to the entrance makes for very different and pleasant feel Great place to have also go for drinks before you hit the bed 
25753,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Would have liked the option of prosecco ie cheaper bubbles in the mini bar , Really lovely food both via room service and in the restaurant Relaxed inviting and friendly atmosphere throughout the hotel Beautiful shower gel Great mini bar 
25754,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, First time in Shoreditch which is just what we were looking for hip happening and cool Only mild disappointment is how long it takes a cab to get to central London from there , Tried room service for a burger and the mozarella salad Both were out of this world Had a family room with two double beds and a baby cot amazingly spacious really impressed Travelling with 3 kids 2 adults 
25755,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, In room included coffee tea etc should be free at this rate , Excellent location far enough from the noise of the city while near all public transport 
25756,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, A bit too much of a party place at night but I guess this is why people comes here And you wont have anything for free it is ridiculous , Design sublime perfect location very nice helpfull and smilling crew 
25757,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Some of the stuff in the room was a bit too hipster was quite noisy also the breakfast was a bit of a disaster Asked for the same thing two days in a row and both times something was wrong with them, Very clean staff were all friendly
25758,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Love the place the only thing I didn t like was that there wasn t much room i the lobby since there was so many other non guest there And I was hoping for more secluded places and open fires like in Los Angeles and maybe a nicer roof bar but that s just me being picky , Coffee and food was great the staff was great and the room was perfect And the area was better than expected Even though I didn t go out and it was a bit of a party area I still really liked the creative feeling of East End Like a chic Berlin 
25759,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Arrival at reception Young man in charge was standoffish and dismissive No nice greeting Deputy was rude On asking why I needed photo ID for myself and partner in room was told wouldn t you like to know who was staying at your house In a superior tone Then told it was for security I was not informed this was needed when booking On arriving back later that night there was no security we were not asked who we were when going through lobby from the bar into the lift The lift did not require the room card to activate the lift as in other hotels so infact anyone could have come to the room Unfortunately the first experience with the staff at arrival made the Ace Hotel a negative experience Great hotel needs friendlier staff with less attitude more humour and more customer experience , Details in room very cool design features and location Music in lobby great 
25760,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Rooms could do with a fridge Semi skimmed milk and some complimentary water would be nice, Comfortable bed nice products in the bathroom great location
25761,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Only downside was the exclusive Wings and Horns robe was 140 to purchase And I don t do enough loafing to warrant that , Fantastic location and a warm welcome from the staff Whilst there s a nightclub and busy bar in the hotel it wasn t noticeable once up in the room Our room was well kitted out and it was a shame we were only staying one night The exclusive Wings Horns robe was a great touch All staff were super friendly and it was on check out that the girl recommended we take a look at the local flower market which was well worth the 10min walk 
25762,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, We ordered cooked breakfast to our room and it was completely cold We booked in advance but were given a disabled room and neither of us are disabled , The staff at the desk were very friendly and its great that check out is at 12 rather than 11 like most hotels 
25763,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The rooms are basic and feel a little prison cell ish The coffee on offer is a sachet of nescafe i m not sure whether this is meant to be cool in an ironic way like offering pot noodles for 2 50 there are far too few plug sockets in the room which makes plugging a hairdryer in near a mirror difficult the shower is average the room was dark and quite cold in late May with aircon off We had breakfast in the restaurant which was pretty average the coffee came cold which to be fair they rectified and i ve made better bloody mary s myself The eggs benedict was nothing special at all for 11 And 12 5 service in the bar for handing a beer over the counter is a bit steep , The style and overall concept of this hotel is very well done even if it screams hipster in your face the moment you walk through the door It depends on your taste but you can t fault it s theme Staff were friendly enough offering to book restaurants etc Good location plenty of better places nearby to eat and drink 
25764,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Tv was non functional no complimentary anything including tea except water Literally no view mine was a brick wall , Bed was comfy staff was pleasant check in and out very quick easy Nicely decorated room Bathroom big and comfortable

25767,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Nothing, The staff were great I thought we might be a little old for the hotel but we were made to feel very welcome and to top it all off The Bike shed is only around the corner 
25768,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, We ordered room service which was lovely food but they charged on top of room service charge a tray to carry the food on charge A bottle of water in the room was 3 50 , Rooms were really clean and very modern There was an iron and ironing board if needed Shower was powerful Beds were low to floor but very comfortable
25769,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, It s a scene The lounge and coffee shop is very popular with a good amount of people just here to be there The staff also gave my friend a hard time for going in and out at night for smoking They should invest in a key system for their doors , The design is amazing I really like their style and approach Very particular design around simplicity and flat colors themes Hip and trendy
25770,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, If you are looking for ber hipster Ace is your spot From the vinyl records in reception the interieur decoration and the sourdough bread for breakfast You won t be surprised to find a man working on his laptop wearing a golden vest and a big hat That s just the kind of dude hanging out in Ace hotel 
25771,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, This is great hotel for spending time with friends and letting your hair down The design is unique urban and very comfortable Perfect location Good club restaurant and bar on site Fun place to party 
25772,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, I think the hotel is a little confused is it a nightclub or hotel At 1 30am our room was so noisy we called to enquire what the noise was sounded like hoovering above us and to see if anything could be done about it and had to shout to be heard by the receptionist over the phone Eventually the hoovering stopped When my partner went outside in the early evening the following day he was refused re entry and told not tonight until he managed to convince him he was staying at the hotel I have emailed to let the hotel know that these things bothered us during our stay though I haven t yet heard anything back The beds are very soft this could be a good thing or a bad thing , Spotless room beautiful bathroom with amazing shower and great products Loads of very expensive mini bar options room service was prompt and great quality Hoi Polloi restaurant is well worth a visit the full English is so good staff were smiley even when run off their feet The location is perfect and the coffee bar options were perfect for us The little details are spot on a flannel in the bathroom for make up removal branded stationary local area guides condoms loads of storage lip balm foot cream aromatherapy oils chargable and beautiful shower products The robes and towels were lovely too 
25773,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, We had two rooms one was noisy throughout the night one was fine Plug sockets were a little sparse for such a large room and the ones there were weren t in a practical place, Comfy bed Nice shower Good shower gel etc Fantastic location Super cool decor and facilities Lovely staff
25774,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, I liked everything what s not to like , every thing you see in your room is for sale the bed is huge and comfy very quiet considering you are in the middle of London even with a nightclub in the hotel staff were lovely I will definitely stay here next time I m in London 
25775,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Cost of the room It was a bit expensive considering the size , The staff as always were so friendly and accommodating The bed was comfortable The breakfast was excellent quality value for money and a good size 
25776,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The room was quite urban masculine in decor No fluffy bathrobes they were grey sweatshirt and no body lotion or heated towel rail in the bathroom which I d think was pretty standard for a luxury room The bed was quite low which caught me out at one point in the evening LOL , Very friendly staff We were upgraded to a quiter luxury room which was clean and comfortable It was very trendy and had a really good vibe in the evening with electronic music in the lobby 
25777,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, the lobby and bar is packed with people who come there to work leaving no space for hotel guests Bar service is spotty, cool vibe nice small touches in the room such as the record player
25778,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Wasnt clear that some of the toiletries in the bathroom are not free Each guest in our party had to produce photo id We were a little surprised at this and felt a little bit like criminals , Its not conventional and has a very relaxed feel 
25779,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Nothing it was all good , We really liked how comfortable the bed was it s was so comfortable we did want to get up We also had an excellent view 
25780,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Totally not a family hotel Not boutique at all this is a bohemian hotel totally different if you don t wear grey preppy not business and sport an Apple Mac this isn t the hotel for you Also we travelled with friends who have a 16 month old and the cot for their room didn t arrive till after we had left for dinner in the eve Then when they returned to their room at 11pm with a sleeping baby they found the hotel hadn t given them any sheets for the cot Would def not go back ,No Positive
25781,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Everywhere you turn you see some moron who you can tell was a normal run of the mill kid growing up but has since moved to shoreditch to reinvent themselves as a cool hipster who is trying to stand out from the crowd Wasn t my cup of tea it was an experience though and all in all hotel is excellent , Could stand under those showers in the room for hours 
25782,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, it was the wrong hotel for me it felt like a student halls at university crossed with a call centre the rooms weren t stylish they were like an ikea work station i think i m too old for the place ,No Positive
25783,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, check in was VERY slow We arrived at 2 room finally ready at 4pm They said they were short staffed in housekeeping that day , Excellent location Well stocked sundries mini bar We loved the tote bag beds very comfortable lots of good pillows 
25784,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, Perfect location loved the interior and the facilities available are great Nice coffee shop and bar Staff dealt with any issues quickly and extremely well 
25785,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Everything had a price tag Being charged service automatically at the bar when we had queued up at the bar , The d cor very funky General feel about the place very relaxed cool 
25786,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, This is the first time I ve stayed at hotel and actually felt like it was aimed at my age group instead of my parents age Loads of space to crack open the laptop and listen to some decent music relaxed friendly staff and on the door step of the bars and clubs of Shoreditch Can t wait to see a few more of these in UK cities 
25787,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Too trendy noisy badly designed rooms Lack of closet space Bad lighting Lack of tv channels couldn t even watch the Oscars Hidden costs , Friendly staff
25788,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Everything in the room can be bought that s absolutely okay But it would be a nice gesture to get at least a free bottle of water Allegedly the condoms are free but there were no condoms to be found in our room , Staff very friendly and very helpful They made sure we got a room with the view we wanted we were offered free drinks from the bar while we waited for the room and they gave us excellent tips for eating out 
25789,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, the usual 5 unbecoming factor of anything you touch costing loads of money in your room treat your guest to a choc bar rather than charging 8 for it ALSO be aware that even on the 6th floor you could hear the club from the basement Oh dear for 240 a night , it s style it s a cool place shame so may people are super aware of this fact and all just apparently want to be seen in the lobby with a mac book wearing a carhartt hat 
25790,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The Hotel was amazing but the price of the robe was a little steep and we really wanted to buy one But at 140 we decided not to , Excellent individual and stylish hotel didn t want to leave The Restaurant breakfast was amazing Brilliant booths with USB plugs and modern meets an industrial retro feel Take me back
25791,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in No this is not a bargain cost wise BUT I found it to be worth the price and would definitely stay here again I found the staff to be super friendly and helpful Great location easy to get the central London Cool vibe Nice coffee shop I enjoyed a tasty brunch at the hotel restaurant as well Buses nearby and a fairly close walk to underground as well Many high quality restaurants in the area I only wish I could have stayed longer 
25792,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The only compliant was that the taxi they arranged for me cost 3 times as much as the one I got back later Oh and they brought only 1 set of cutlery for 2 breakfasts in bed so we had to keep swapping Would have taken too long to call them back , The room is so well designed and everything is available so you don t have to call down for an iron etc The check in team are really friendly
25793,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Room service took too long breakfast was not included, Location excellent only a few minute walk from Old Street Station Good bars and restaurants near by Especially The Breakfast Club 
25794,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, the service in the restaurant is quite mediocre especially compared to ACE LA also the lobby is full of working people non hotel guests 24 hours a day so no room anywhere to sit or relax, design and the room are perfect
25795,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The coffee shop becomes very crowded with people using the free WiFi and sipping glasses of free water while they tap away on banks of laptops with their headphones in The food and drinks are fantastic and it would be great to find a seat to enjoy them more easily , The staff and facilities were excellent Couldn t have been more helpful and made our stay a real pleasure The music theme and vinyl store link ups make for a great atmosphere Will definately be returning 
25796,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, People occupying the lobby sitting with their laptops but no food or drink Being Charged a service charge for going to the bar ourselves Private function in Nightclub not for residents EVERYTHING in the room came at a price Daren t touch anything, Location
25797,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The rooms are not being soundproofed you can hear any kind of noise from next room In particular you should choose a room at upper floors because you can also hear too much noise from Shoreditch high street especially on fridays and saturdays , the room service is very efficient There is a bus stop nearby the location is convenient if you like bohemian spots of east London area 
25798,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, I think it would be good if guests at the hotel were able to enter the club in the building on a guestlist Our breakfast in bed would have been delicious if it had been warm enough Unfortunately it was cold by the time it arrived We enjoyed our room but were a little disappointed that we have no view It made the living space seem really quite dark as we faced onto the building opposite , The staff were very helpful and friendly The hotel itself is a really cool building and well laid out The location is also excellent for exploring Shoreditch 
25799,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Service at restaurant or rather our waiter was quite slow Was easily solved by talking to another staff member who served us well , Best hotel ever it has a young and cool vibe as well as great rooms and customer service Never staying anywhere else in London after finding this gem 
25800,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, Right in the Centre of Shoreditch We stayed in an internal room and it was so quiet Which is good as I was concerned we would hear lots of noise from the Street bars below The room done up in an industrial theme is comfy and doesn t lack any mod cons A proper 5 hotel 
25801,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, There were some hairs in the bathtub as if someone had shaved, Record player and library is a nice touch however the music player oddly doesn t have bluetooth meaning you can t play your own music 
25802,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The room felt too much like a dorm room I get they re going for a hipster look but it was too much for me and they charged for everything, The lobby food and bar
25803,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Not a bad experience but stupid things like plastic crates cheap metal office furniture and kettle leads that do not reach the plug point from a work surface is poor and no way should this be rated 5 star , Very hip venue mainly designed for 21 40 year old guests Decor and location views of London good Close to hot venues for eating and night life 
25804,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Low bed couldnt find the remote control no kettle , The lack of parking space was a turn off but expected for central London The lobby was very trendy and cool but a little loud luckily we were on the 4 th floor The room was really cool but the bed was very low and there was no kettle for coffee 
25805,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, In trying to be cool it sometimes makes comfort and ease of use of elements in the room a bit difficult Great for social but maybe not ideal for business , Cool hotel nice staff and some nice service touches
25806,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, The whole venue hotel bar club has a great atmosphere very welcoming good fun and nice and Christmasy too Our room was fantastic spacious and cool we really enjoyed the record player thank you 
25807,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, If you want to make use of the lobby in this hotel you may find yourself needing to go to your room Very limited spaces full of non hotel guests off the street to using the facilities No decaff coffee available in the rooms , Great hotel with great personal service 
25808,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, I was given a room facing the Main Street on the first floor unfortunately the room was not sound proof from the noisy party night owls outside , Alice part of the reception team was exceptional I had issues with my online booking initially She was so accommodating and helped me sorted out my booking She was efficient reliable professional and put my mind at ease enabling me to look forward to an enjoyable trip first class service 
25809,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, Fabulous and extremely friendly Hotel The staff at the reception were very helpful and informative The breakfast was exceptional good The staff delivered what we asked for Lovely and relaxing environment Thankyou everyone 
25810,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, We did order a room service breakfast that arrived luke warm indigo our guardian angel sorted this out swiftly and effectively Incredible customer service , This hotel was excellent on every level From the moment we arrived in the taxi the staff were attentive and tended to our every need this was especially important as we were travelling with our 7 month old baby The vibe of the hotel was cool and laid back which really suited us and the room interior had every little detail you could want I can t speak more highly of the whole concept of this hotel We truly had the most fantastic couple of days and could have easily spent it all in our hotel room 
25811,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, The night manager was very rude absolutely not what I expect from Ace and not what I have experienced before His manner was aggressive and intimidating , I love the hotel great location for me love the decor 
25812,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Found the staff at reception where a little try hard cool The most helpfull people where the guys that looked after the suitcases for us We arrived at 3pm after a flight from Berlin and our room still wasn t ready , Location room styling shower and bathroom products where awesome Bed was so comfy 
25813,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, We were there as part of a wedding party but may not have gone other wises to a hotel that seems to be aimed at younger people , We were treated very well and anything that we asked to have sorted out was give prompt and cheerful attention 
25814,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, If I had to pick anything the bed was too low and pillow protectors should be standard but I m being uber fussy I loved it , Staff were fabulous and hotel was brilliantly cool Will definitely return with my pooch for weekend break 
25815,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch,No Negative, The design of hotel is stylish and trendy The room is cozy with everything basically The staff are nice and provided very good advices to look around the neighborhood 
25816,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, the location as great as it is to walk to the embankment we were at the front which meant very noisy at night randomly the room had tin cups which makes morning tea very impractical , Loved the staff impulsively getting an umbrella to escourt me to the car and the themed room was brilliant The concierge are worth their weight in gold 
25817,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Long wait for breakfast that was ultimately cold , After a long wait for a breakfast that turned out to be cold the manager of the restaurant apologised and comped the two breakfasts thats very good management of a poor service incident 
25818,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Can I suggest that in the rooms you put a mirror near the plug and a mirror over the washbasin as my wife struggled to style her hair and I struggle to see what I was doing shaving, great hotel in a really interesting and exciting part of town Loved the layout and the look of the hotel and the record shop next door just a cool hotel
25819,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, It was a Saturday night and there was a lot of noise outside the hotel so hard to sleep Next time I will ask for a room at the back of the hotel, The staff were excellent and very helpful The beds were comfy and I loved having a record player and vinyl in the room
25820,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Repeat stay clients like myself are not rewarded My room was very basic Did not feel welcomed, Love the location in Shoreditch Very Hip and happening hotel Love the Hoi Polloi restaurant 
25821,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Nights and lobby are a party It s like a disco pub all around I like it But just the people should know It s this type of hotel From the room you don t hear anything from the lobby but from the street you do a bit Our room was on the 5th floor , You have everything you need in terms of trendy east London life style Cool bar restaurant pub disco people Always there is people around If you want you wouldn t have to move from the hotel in the whole weekend 
25822,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, We asked at reception if they could direct us to the nearest Starbucks and were asked why we weren t trying the amazing coffee in the hotel I understand the need for staff to sell their own coffee but if a guest wants Starbucks direct them to Starbucks Incidentally we tried the hotel coffee the following day and it was cold Also some of our party ordered room service and it was also cold They were disappointed in room service completely as they intended to share their order so when ordering a side of sausages they didn t realise that this meant 1 sausage Quite difficult to share 1 sauasage between 4 people , The location of the hotel was fantastic and the style of the hotel was super trendy 
25823,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, during the day it looked like a hipster coffee shop Non guests are welcome to come and bring their laptops to the hotel lobby , Liked the atmosphere at night as the place turned into a hotspot having a club and a lounge bar 
25824,Ace Hotel London Shoreditch, Rooms are cozy but a little dark The restaurant seems a little overrated compared to the places in the neighborhood , Location is excellent if you want to go out at night Vibrant atmosphere and very friendly customer oriented staff
