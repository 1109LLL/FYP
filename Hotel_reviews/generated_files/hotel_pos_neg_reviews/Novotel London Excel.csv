240502,Novotel London Excel, Breakfast choice was great but the buffet food was dry and not fresh I did order from the menu and that came fresh , Sam was great she kept my son entertained while I was checking in as I was travelling without my husband It was right opposite the Excel where I d taken my son to see the Lego exhibition The bed was so comfortable slept like a log

240505,Novotel London Excel, More dining options in the immediate area would have been nice , Bed was super comfy and breakfast exceptional making for a great start to each day of my business trip In addition Levi and others at the front desk were most kind and helpful when I needed extra assistance orientation to some technological differences between US and UK Would highly recommend for anyone conferencing at the Excel as it is just a 5 minute walk to the exhibition center Thank you 
240506,Novotel London Excel, The air conditioning AC was not working in my room No enough shampoo conditioner towels only one shampoo and the room is booked for 3 and we have to ask for more , Near to London Excel
240507,Novotel London Excel, I marked this hotel down due to the Air con not being sufficient enough to cool the room down I stayed when it was extremely hot and the Air con just didn t cut it All other members in my party also complained about this I do hope that the hotel management do something about this problem It would not put me off staying again , Good Hotel and well placed for events Room comfortable too

240510,Novotel London Excel, The location is awkward the A C facility was bad even though my room was changed but the replacement room was worse due to A C blowing hot rather than cold air when set to cold mode Horrible sweaty night , Nothing 
240511,Novotel London Excel, it was a busy time when we checked in and there were big groups and limited receptionists to book people in it was 3pm , nice clean comfy exec room close to bars restaurants things to see and do
240512,Novotel London Excel, The room we had booked was unavailable when we arrived We weren t told this when checking in and had to move room once and then complain before staff admitted they didn t have the room we had booked We were given a discount on the room we ended up in as compensation,No Positive
240513,Novotel London Excel, coffee and tea at breakfast were not particularly hot Otherwise everything else was fine , we were allocated the newly refurbished rooms and so everything was fresh and the bed was very comfortable the hotel is ideally situated near City Airport although eventually we travelled by train 
240514,Novotel London Excel, All fine, It was very comfortable I was taking part in the Open water swim and so arrived the night before I may have missed this but it would have been helpful to provide info re how to get to excel i e What tube stop rail stop etc 
240515,Novotel London Excel, Details of local transport options from airport to hotel were not clear No shuttle had to grab a 15 euro taxi for a 5 minute drive the underground would have taken me the one stop for 1 30 euros Cleaners ambitious to finish their rounds Knocked four times although l d informed them that l was checking out at 12 00 , Staff were very friendly and helpful room was clean and comfortable Closely located to underground and access to central Stuttgart 
240516,Novotel London Excel, No air con the room was extremely stuffy and to hot to sleep in properly Breakfast was okay but not excellent for 16 45 each Drinks were very over priced small glass of wine 6 00, The hotel was nice with the sun terrace and the free foot massagers
240517,Novotel London Excel, Would have been nice for a least one English person on reception Frustrating this time not as good as 3 weeks ago Breakfast price needs reviewing too expensive , Shower amazing and bed comfy The negative points would not put me off from returning Good hotel overall

240519,Novotel London Excel, Fridge door in room didn t close so couldn t keep our drinks cold on the hottest day of the year No hot water on 18th June so couldn t shower and be fresh after the hottest day of year Offered a free breakfast But there was a lingering smell from the male toilets near reception Soneone had made a real mess in the cubicle and the stench creeped around the breakfast area , Good bed generally clean
240520,Novotel London Excel, Not much to dislike Have stayed here before and would stay again , Could be a little more flexible with breakfast 16 is too much to pay if you only require continental type breakfast We stayed in a similar hotel in the area recently and could choose and pay for as much or as little as you require 
240521,Novotel London Excel, Sausages were raw inside at breakfast I reported this to staff more sausages were made but they were totally undercooked as well This was very disappointing , Hotel was in a great location staff were friendly 
240522,Novotel London Excel,No Negative, Good location to go to O2 Our room was spacious comfortable and clean Delicious breakfast with a lot of choice Staff very helpful and friendly 
240523,Novotel London Excel, Staff were friendly but a bit disorganised and didn t seem to communicate with each other Our rooms weren t ready when we arrived and we had an event to get to within a couple of hours of arrival and needed to get ready We decided to have some food while we waited The food was really nice but we asked twice for cutlery and it didn t come Then when we got into our rooms one of them smelt horrendously of sick We called down to be moved but were told someone from housekeeping would come up We waited for half an hour and still no one I had to call down again to get the room changed When I went down to change the keys the person on the desk didn t know about the issue so I had to explain for a 3rd time All was good once we moved rooms , Comfy beds good rooms Good deals with the pizza and a drink for 12 
240524,Novotel London Excel, Hotel view and the fact that anyone can walk into the hotel late at night Especially with recent terrorist acts Should be locked with a code entrance or something similar , Nice hotel near to the DLR Friendly staff 
240525,Novotel London Excel, Air Con in room not up to job room very stuffy Shower tray flooded shower controls temperamental , Good public transport links New room styling good Breakfast good Cleanliness good Excellent location for O2 or Olympic Park 
240526,Novotel London Excel, The only problem was with the key cards had 2 get reception to sort the keys out 3 times but was done quickly Maybe get some new cards as the magnet strips are getting worn, Most of the hotel was excellent had a lovely stay and was made to feel welcome
240527,Novotel London Excel, Wasn t a fan of the price but for four days in a prime location with excellent staff I can t complain too much Would definitely go again, Excellent location near the excel centre Friendly and very helpful staff Didn t spend enough time at the restaurant facilities to give a fair opinion but the food was good and the staff were great from my short time there 
240528,Novotel London Excel, Last time we went to Novotel hotel they had a machine to make your pancakes unfortunately this time they didn t and the food had gone a bit dry under the lights Also the sofa bed was a bit comfortable, The room was lovely we are very close excel centre Staff were great 
240529,Novotel London Excel, The restaurant could have been better a pool and a hot tub would have been nice , Good location fairly new area and very mellow vibe The Crystal is within walking distance easy access to public transit like the DLR and the Emirates A few good eating spots check out Top good food great staff 
240530,Novotel London Excel, The nearest Train station was closed and had been for several months for refurbishment Also the hotel was undergoing refurbishment of all of its rooms Neither of these disturbances were made public at the time of booking but must have been known The bed was very hard and was not comfortable to sleep in hopefully the refurbishment will correct this problem The restaurant menu was very limited and the service despite being almost empty but well staffed was very slow We had to wait over 35 minutes to get our dessert The hotel did recognise this and gave us a discount , We had a terrible journey getting to the hotel The check in was efficient and the receptionist having asked about our journey upgraded us to a suite This said whilst the hotel is ideally situated if you are going to the Excel centre it is well off the beaten track for other parts of London Other than the hotel there are very few places to eat in the neighbourhood 
240531,Novotel London Excel, Plane noise on weekday mornings didn t bother us at weekend though, Great view across docklands excellent newly refurbished comfortable room good breakfast choice decent bar free drinks as part of loyalty card friendly staff esp Rugile good price for London Close to Royal Victoria Docklands Light Railway station one stop from Jubilee line even closer to Emirates Air Line well worth a trip great views Next to Excel centre and O2 
240532,Novotel London Excel,No Negative, The staff are always very friendly and really helpful They do all they can to assist I find the rooms are always very clean and comfortable and the new rooms are really nice Parking is limited but there is a large car park just near the hotel approx 2 min walk The food in the restaurant is also very good 
240533,Novotel London Excel, Towels although looked clean didn t smell fresh I appreciate they may have been washed with non fragrant detergent but something was not quite right ,No Positive
240534,Novotel London Excel, It was a very enjoyable weekend Every thing was great Can t think of anything negative at the moment , I liked the privacy glass in the bathroom Very unique 
240535,Novotel London Excel, 21 for simple buffet breakfast rip off Being charged to park my car when the two rooms cost nearly 300 rip off 5 for a bottle of beer rip off Can t help but feel slightly ripped off here , Shower room
240536,Novotel London Excel, We were not pre warned about building works going on in hotel between 10am 6pm So as we like to make the most of the excellent facilities we arrived shortly after check in time 2pm so we can relax and generally spend some quality quiet time together But no The noise was ear piercing to say the least The hotel did move us to the 9th floor but works could be heard loudly from reception on 1st floor all the way to where we were relocated on the 9th Not impressed really as we know this to be a good hotel Feel a bit let down really as we paid 115 for the night We could have got hotels in area half that price for the same time and would have used the free cancellation time if we had of know this was going to be the case Even after breakfast you haven t got to check out until 12 noon but at bang on 10am the drilling started like being in a dentist chair So once again not impressed Booking com has let us down on this occasion , Rooms were lovely and facilities great
240537,Novotel London Excel, Plumbing in bathroom is not very good Room and bathroon facilities remember better times Noise from outside early morning bins being colected at about 5 30 buses with running engines But over all very good experience, The room was comfortable and spacious perfectly cleaned Easy access to London via the DLR
240538,Novotel London Excel, Parking was very expensive it would be better to reflect the charges online that way one is able to make alternative arrangements if they cannot afford the parking , bed was comfy room was spacious and clean staff were excellent and very helpful
240539,Novotel London Excel, Service in the morning was a little slow had to ask for tea and coffee Separate toilet not ideal as had to come out to wash hands Breakfast food ran out had to ask for it to be topped up, Everything else except comments below Reception staff pleasant and helpful Bar staff helpful and attentive Location ideal
240540,Novotel London Excel, The meal I had in the restaurant the fish sandwich Strong fishy odour and very strong fishy taste When asked about the meal explained the above When presenting the bill 50 was removed from the main meal Very kind gesture Unfortunately since I have been ill with gastro intestininal distress In other words I have spent a lot of time in the bathroom , Excellent staff Very attentive
240541,Novotel London Excel, Didn t appear to be any wifi available when you d expect it at that kind of hotel We warned about building work but got woken up at 8am on Sunday from someone hammering when it wasn t supposed to start that early Also our room was not ready until 90 minutes after the supposed check in time , Beds were very comfy and the room was very spacious and modern 
240542,Novotel London Excel, There was nothing I really didn t like but I would prefer the sofa beds to be more comfortable as my daughter said she could feel the springs but we remedied this by folding the super size duvet so she slept on that , The size of the rooms and the bathroom are really spacious and have everything you need for a relaxing stay Breakfast was superb with loads to choose from The added bonus of being able to use the sauna and steam room was brilliant I will definitely be booking her again 
240543,Novotel London Excel, The first room we had smelt like an exploded vacuum bag really musty and overpowering Staff quickly rectified this and moved us to room of equal size and standards Price hike of rooms due to aforementioned Dance Competition at the Excel Centre Oh well , The upgraded room Friendly personable staff Even though it was busy due to a Dance competition at the Excel Centre the staff took time to make you feel welcome Double thumbs up I also really like the shower and option for additional privacy no one want s to see you using the toilet from the bedroom 
240544,Novotel London Excel, Not a big issue but I d like to see some complementary bottles of water The phone in the room had issues and getting a line to make a local call was an impossibility I tried reporting this but nothing was done about it , The proximity to the Excel was the main reason for my decision to stay at this property 
240545,Novotel London Excel,No Negative, Clean tidy good size rooms with shower and a bath good breakfast good restaurant good bar good wi fi What more do you need Car park reasonably priced too Just 100 yards or so from the ExCel which was absolutely ideal for us 
240546,Novotel London Excel, Expensive Breakfast simple monotonous little choice Coffee disgusting Every expense made in the hotel had to be paid on the spot unless you pay in advance a lumpsum reserve an amount on your credit card they call it but comes down to the same so they have zero trust in their customers In the bar having expensive drinks we suggested on the third round to get some peanuts and when the bill came saw these were charged at 3 90 Sheets not changed in the 4 nights I stayed Nasty smell in the room , Location but only if you need to be at Excel otherwise surely not Bed good Wifi fast 
240547,Novotel London Excel, No ironing board in room unless you count the one masquerading as the bed or it may have been an orthopaedic stone mattress And just what exactly is a double pillow , Staff very helpful and friendly good food and service 
240548,Novotel London Excel, Bathroom shower wasn t as clean as I have had in this hotel in the past My toiletries were never replaced and I stayed three nights, Location great good value for money
240549,Novotel London Excel, The room was too small for 3 people The pull out bed was lumpy and not very comfortable and everytimr we used the sink in the bathroom there was a funny smell afterwards We had a big to into what was a small car park We eventually got it in there but it was a tight squeeze , The location was great for the excel centre Had a lovey terrace bar where you could sit out having lunch and a beer in the sunshine The breakfast was lovely 
240550,Novotel London Excel, Room was too hot But used air con to cool it down, Lovely comfortable hotel So close to Excel good train connections Staff really helpful and friendly Loved the free lemon orange ice water in reception lovely touch Will return
240551,Novotel London Excel, Strong smell of drains in the rooms reported to engineer Probably due to works being done Beds are hard Breakfast could have more variety and better quality Sausages are barely edible , Staff are great Ideal for ExCel Rooms are large Reasonable price Breakfast is expensive though 
240552,Novotel London Excel,No Negative, This hotel is ideal for visitors to the Excel Arena It is situated at the western door and down a flight of steps The rooms are modern and comfortable the breakfast is good and the staff are friendly and helpful I walked to and from London City Airport to the hotel in about twenty minutes each way There is a footbridge alongside the hotel and then a pleasant walk past Barrier Park worth a visit if you have time There is a local shop across the way and a small Tesco nearby great for a few things and a small bottle of wine for an evening meal I was busy and didn t know when I would get to eat All in all a good hotel choice 
240553,Novotel London Excel, The mattress on the sofa bed was very uncomfortable Also the hotel was having works carried out fair enough but when it states that they will not start work till 10am when actually it was more like 8am it is misrepresentation ,No Positive
240554,Novotel London Excel, well the hotel itself was nice however we were put a in a room superior room that we booked for valentines day as a couple and the staff failed to tell us that every day of our stay from 9am to 6pm there would be very VERY loud building work going on drilling hammering continously without breaks Completely ruined our stay there as we couldnt even drown it out with something like the TV as it was so loud even having the TV on max volume you couldnt hear it over the drilling We phoned reception to complain and they said numerous other guests were complaining about this to Felt completely ripped off that they took the money when we arrived without advising us about the loud building work which they later admitted they knew would be happening as the builders are there in the rooms next to us on our floor every day 9am to 6pm Pity cause the room was clean and view was ok but made our stay completely horrible Cant believe we spent our days off from work paying 150 to be woken up by drilling and hammering and couldnt even sit in our room in the day at all cause we spent all day trying to get out of there for some peace and quiet the whole thing we booked the hotel to have I was promised after them offering us a free breakfast to apologise that they would refund me half of my 150 however this is yet to happen ,No Positive
240555,Novotel London Excel, I didn t like the fact that I booked the hotel for Valentine s Day and was woken up at 8 in the morning from the sounds of banging and crashing and drilling coming from upstairs Fair enough they have to refurbish the hotel but nobody informed us of it If I knew I would have cancelled and stayed somewhere else I told reception and they gave us a complimentary breakfast and free parking but it wasn t enough to be honest It was ruined and me and my partner couldn t even hear ourselves speak because of the noise in the room , The facilities were very good
240556,Novotel London Excel, There was no one to attend the baggage when we checked in and I requested for a river side view which none of the staff members attempted to find one or provide info on the non availability , Ambiance and service was good specially the staff at the breakfast counter who made sure we are attended at the table 
240557,Novotel London Excel, Maybe could have some quiet zone floors as found I heard banging a lot coming from lots of other rooms , Hotel is in a beautiful location right by the dock lands easy to find secure parking fairly priced staff were lovely friendly room was nice the spa gym were relaxing the restaurant upper deck was gorgeous 
240558,Novotel London Excel, Carpets in Novotel were disgusting very very stained and dirty had to keep shoes on This was a shame as hotel was good beds comfortable but stained chairs and carpets let it down , We had plenty of choice F
240559,Novotel London Excel, We didn t like the standard of rooms we were initially offered as it was meant to be superior but not up to Premier Inn standard The two we were initially offered were tired old fashioned and smelly The price structuring has now become greedy and over priced and that s with a so called upgrade For regular stayers at your hotel we are disappointed being fobbed off with sub standard rooms that were a so called upgrade If we didn t know about the better rooms we would have stayed in the room like my sister had and that was with the upgrade Your standards have dropped significantly and with so much competition around you will not survive We will think twice about staying with you next time we go to an event at O2 We asked for freshly lightly fried eggs this morning but were given eggs that had been sitting under a lamp for hours We are not impressed with our experience of staying at the Novotel this time , The room we eventually had was great but that was upon refusing two other rooms that were certainly not modern or inviting The food was relatively good but not the breakfasts 
240560,Novotel London Excel, Breakfast was cold over cooked and scrambled eggs were terrible and when asked to even microwave it it was not possible Room service advertised a wide variety yet when it come to it there was only sandwiches not best pleased as we was all starving after a long concert Staff had no idea what they was doing in the restaurant regulating bills got told we had a free drink showed our room numbers but still put it on the bill Television in the bedroom only went to 30 as my partner is slightly hard or hearing with all the planes going accros he couldn t even hear the tv Mini bar is nice and room was spacious, The fact it is a short taxi ride away from the 02 spacious lobby nice bar and restaurant area next to the river balcony setting was nice
240561,Novotel London Excel, Check in was a little cumbersome room was priced on the high side , Room was fantastic and bed was extremely comfortable Restaurant was excellent with great views from the terrace 
240562,Novotel London Excel, The room service although good The food was cold which was a shame , The location to the 02 was perfect to stay The hotel was lovely and the secure car park was fantastic
240563,Novotel London Excel, There really wasn t enough soundproofing and so the planes flying past to london city airport at low altitude were really loud in the room Also cooked breakfast was stone cold and though it was included for us we would say it s definitely not worth the 21 each that anyone who doesn t have breakfast included would pay I get a better breakfast for 3 50 from my local breakfast bar , Bed was comfy and the decor was nice 
240564,Novotel London Excel, The food was not warm enough food items described in the menu were missing when actual food arrived waiters slow awkward arrangement of room water running for two days despite request for repair ,No Positive
240565,Novotel London Excel,No Negative, Went down for breakfast and there was no veg sausages asked a member of staff who went and got some cooked and bought out to us Was made very welcomed by front desk on arrival by Charlene I think her name was She very polite and smiley excellent customer service 
240566,Novotel London Excel, Nothing at all but more room service options in the early hours would be make it even better , The room was delightful and spotless and bose speaker was a bonus 
240567,Novotel London Excel, More drinks available in mini bar Hairdryer wasn t working in room requested one was told have to wait until the morning , Spacious room bed was extremely comfy as was the couch Staff were very helpful Power shower was brilliant 
240568,Novotel London Excel, The pillows were really uncomfy for some reason faultless apart from that, Nice hotel great location friendly staff reasonably sized rooms compared to standard hotel rooms in london
240569,Novotel London Excel, No lighting over wardrobes no drawers and the assumption that all TV viewing will be done while on in the bed why not swivel One days cleaning and replenishment very poor others were fine , Proximity of Excel Arena and car park
240570,Novotel London Excel,No Negative, We asked about biscuits when we arrived and the staff got us some with a picture of fat boy slim who we were there it watch when we got back to the hotel Class 
240571,Novotel London Excel, I booked a family room but I had to sleep on the couch as the sofa bed had not been made up When I complained the deputy manager offered me a 505 discount but only if I did not contact head office blackmail , Staff friendly
240572,Novotel London Excel, Staff didnt seem to know what each other are doing Was told by member of staff i had paid and breakfast was included then told by another member i hadnt paid and breakfast was 19 each I booked so long ago i couldnt remember if i had paid or not but seeing as they were both looking at same computer screen i would of expected some consistency, Nice hotel
240573,Novotel London Excel, Breakfast was delivered late and wasn t great No iron and ironing board in room When I called for one I was told there was one in the room but there wasn t after quite a long conversation I was bought one up to my room I was also in a disabled room but wasn t told this at the time of check in If I had been I would have asked for an alternative , Bed and pillows very comfortable
240574,Novotel London Excel, aircon in room was a little noisy so I turned it off but this is a general problem in most hotels otherwise little I could fault, Proximity to Excel Exhibition centre Attentiveness of staff ease of Parking Comfort of room and excellent bathroom shower
240575,Novotel London Excel, If you are driving going through London can be a pain maybe going round the M25 and coming in from the North is easier , Excellent parking comfortable rooms and easy access to the O2 for events 
240576,Novotel London Excel, Absolutely nothing highly rate this Hotel and staff can t fault a thing , Ease of getting to the hotel as it being only 20 minutes from guys hospital it s far cheaper to stay outside london and travel in when needed The bed is the comfiest bed I ve even slept in best night sleep in years Staff are always very welcoming very polite and professional and will help you with anything you need Value for money is exceptional and I d highly recommend booking an executive suite with queen bed as the rooms are very spacious and even comes with a coffee machine and mini fridge Parking is on site and can only be accessed via a barrier so is very safe also and costs as little as 16 overnight well worth it 
240577,Novotel London Excel, There really was nothing to dislike , Very Nice clean rooms Has everything that you need Staf very friendly always willing to help Fitness and sauna also very clean and everything looks new in the room and fitness Very close by public transport I also like the details as fresh fruit water for free in lobby machine for footmassage also for free Good WiFi everywhere in hotel They have the roomcards made of Bamboo and try to do their best being eco friendly I would definetely come back here 
240578,Novotel London Excel, The bar and food were a little to expensive for my liking but thats to be expected in London , The hotel was fantastic We arrived at the hotel 2 hours early and to our surprise they had a room already and waiting The staff were great anything we needed they were happy to help with The restaurant staff were super friendly in the evenings and we stayed in the bar for the majority of the evening 
240579,Novotel London Excel,No Negative, Rooms were great large and very clean Shower gel soap and shampoo good quality and appreciated Room was very quiet All in all a very good experience 
240580,Novotel London Excel, The beds are very hard this gave some back problems after 3 nights , The hotel is only 100 m away from the Excel West entrance ideal for our purpose Also access to London with the DLR was easy Nice bar and restaurant 
240581,Novotel London Excel, We were not informed that drinking the bottled water in the rooms would cost a lot of money prior to our departure and on requesting tap water from reception at night we were turned away and informed that we would have to pay for any drinking water which was a shame , Rooms were clean and spacious and staff were helpful with requests that the rooms would be facing the water There was a large selection of breakfast options everything was fresh and enjoyable The bar facing the water had a nice ambiance and being located next to a train station was very convenient 
240582,Novotel London Excel, Aircon in the room was tricky to control which meant the room was hotter than ideal quite an achievement in October, very friendly helpful staff at check in and check out Pleasant well fitted out room and bathroom great views of the dock from the restaurant at breakfast 
240583,Novotel London Excel, Only two things First despite booking the room for two we were only given towels for one person one bath sheet and one face towel Second the lady on the reception who was checking us in was speaking very quietly that and combination with pretty strong accent made it hard to answer her questions but she was very nice none the less it would just help if she could speak little louder , The location was great as we were attending Comic Con The room was spacious and clean There are quite a few places just around the corner to grab food and drinks if you don t feel like getting anything from the hotel restaurant Very easy access to DLR 
240584,Novotel London Excel, The staff all over this hotel were to be frank abysmal Too many cooks at reception with 3 or 4 members of staff all trying to check us in consequently confusing each other It took FAR too long to find my reservation despite having all the references to hand The rooms were not made up as twins despite this being a request I had phoned through two days earlier We had to wait for this Breakfast staff were useless it took nearly 25 minutes for me to get a cup of tea that I couldn t drink because I needed to leave The bar staff in the evening were competent however I did not appreciate being huffed and puffed at when ordering a cocktail because they re faffy to make Don t make these drinks available on your menu if you are not prepared to serve them One bar staff member even said to me Are you sure because this will take more than 20 minutes to make I said yes I was sure and he rolled his eyes TERRIBLE On check out I was told I could not get a VAT receipt for my parking as they did not have the facility to produce this Absolute rubbish After another 20 minutes of waiting arounf I was given one What a waste of my time The hotel itself was lovely The staff at this hotel are under trained arrogant and slow for this reason we will not stay here again , The waffles were lovely however on my second morning they were replaced by pancakes which were not as nice
240585,Novotel London Excel, The seats in the bar area could have been a bit more comfortable , Fantastic location for a trip to explore London Nice modern Hotel with fabulous Staff Great value for money 
240586,Novotel London Excel, Tiny carpark which lets cars in even when full Tight twin room with the smallest loo I have ever seen , Great location for the Excel centre Clean room Good breakfast Decent size minibar fridge Efficient check in and out 
240587,Novotel London Excel, Bathroom and loo a bit cramped lots of manoeuvering to get in and out , The bed was super comfy the staff so friendly and helpful Even though London City Airport is close not a sound could be heard Fabulous location on the Thames 
240588,Novotel London Excel, For the price no complaints But could have more in room comforts, Big spacious hotel well designed well lit well equipped great staff A separate WC Nice touch Right next to a station 
240589,Novotel London Excel, That booking com messed up my booking There was no swimming pool as original selected I was booked into one room of which on arrival was told not possible so wasted time had to wait for rooms to be available after having to sort things out with hotel over cost Very disappointed Actually lost theatre tickets because of delay not impressed ,No Positive
240590,Novotel London Excel, The car park isn t the best for moneuvering around and the TV didn t have signal most of the time , Breakfast was lovely but would have liked a bit more choice for eggs as there was only scrambled Loved having the Bluetooth radio media player in the room 
240591,Novotel London Excel, No river view , After stay customer service was unbelievable Noemi went above and beyond the call of duty to post back items if left in the safe back to me within 24hours as my sone needed his passport for another trip a few days later Fantastic customer service Brilliant position for 02 concerts 
240592,Novotel London Excel, Was told that I can park And in morning they would not let my car out until I payed 16 which was not mentioned And made ruined mine and my family stay ,No Positive
240593,Novotel London Excel, Checkout was very slow with few staff available took around 10 minutes to get down the queue Breakfast buffet was so so scrambled eggs of a poor quality restaurant staff good , Friendly Staff good bar Car park very handy under cover so easy to access reception Location is good as it is near several reasonable restaurants and the station 
240594,Novotel London Excel, Found things in my room from a previous guest so room obviously wasn t cleaned properly , Staff members were lovely especially the reception staff were amazing the man that checked us in really made our stay pleasant

240596,Novotel London Excel, Shower leaked all over the floor as the door didn t seal well and shower head had water shooting out of it it needed replacing really Bathroom doors are frosted glass so anyone using the bathroom at night will shine the bright light straight into the bedroom , Quite a nice hotel rooms are big for a London hotel and the bar and restaurant is pretty good 
240597,Novotel London Excel, It was all perfect , The hotel is right next to London Excel so perfect for us as we were attending a weekend convention The location on the river is great and breakfast in the restaurant overlooking the river was most enjoyable 
240598,Novotel London Excel, The bathrooms need attention Problems with smelly drains , We had a problem with the room and one of the managers reduced our bill the following day The drain in the bathroom smelt awful 
240599,Novotel London Excel, Plumbing in bathroom not so great shower tray filled up rather quickly which meant standing in a small pool of water Seperate toilet good idea but should have hand washing facilities so guests don t have to go to bathroom to wash hands spread of germs , Excellent location and nice clean facilities

240608,Novotel London Excel, The room was described as Superior Queen Room with Sofa Bed For one adult and two teenagers staying it was cramped The air conditioning was virtually non existent When you ran the taps there was a dreadful smell of drains Overall this made for an uncomfortable stay ,No Positive
240609,Novotel London Excel, I would like to have stayed longer , Comprehensive breakfast choice served in a restaurant with nice views over the water Right next door to the Excell centre and an easy walk to DLR and emirates air line 
240610,Novotel London Excel, Breakfast could have been cheaper per person Breakfast could have more variety and the areas where breakfast is doesn t give you enough space to put your plate down to grab your servings As the containers were very hot to touch and juggle with a plate full of food Lastly with the booking it wasn t right as for breakfast they had us down as 1 person rather than 2 even though we paid for 2 , The hotel was very clean and spacious The reception staff were very helpful The hotel was in close proximity to the venue Rooms were very clean and bright The bar staff were very nice and friendly We were very happy with the drinks and the price in which we paid 
240611,Novotel London Excel, Breakfast should be cheaper even if just weekends ie none business days Menu does not display breakfast or prices 16 a pop is extortionate for 3 adults would be 48 5 99 for a full English at Cafe Bonnane on the same block Having to get the DLR which was ok was just a bridge to sometimes after a number of tubes then the Canning switch , The Royal Victoria dock location and view Cleanliness and style of the hotel 
240612,Novotel London Excel, The ONLY thing I found uncomfortable was the temperature of the gym on the 8th floor it was very warm and humid , Everyone working on the property was extremely polite and friendly Breakfast was very good as well 
240613,Novotel London Excel, Shower had a horrible smell of sewage which meant we couldn t use it in the morning before our big cycle We were forced to change rooms half way through our stay Toilets in the lobby were the same so clearly a wider problem Pasta we had in the restaurant was very bland and more like something you d serve in a kids menu Disappointing considering price Not ideal having the toilet in a different part of the room from the sink to wash your hands Led to a lot of noise during the night , Twin room was a good size Bed was comfy

240623,Novotel London Excel, The room wasn t the most spacious I ve ever stayed in especially the bathroom with a separate loo The big beds didn t leave a lot of space The bath was tiny and the shower door opened outwards causing water to drip all over the tiled floor just before you climb out of the shower , Great location for the O2 Big comfy beds when you re in them Room had everything you would expect TV tea coffee facilities hairdryer etc No noise heard from anyone else must have great soundproofing Wi fi is easy to connect to reliable and fairly quick for hotel wi fi Very close to Custom House stop on the DLR so easy to get into central London

240650,Novotel London Excel, Room had a funny smell which was probably the air freshener used its always a shame that the windows can t be opened for a bit of a blow through when being cleaned , All facilities were more than I expected for a budget hotel particularly the toiletries tissues waste bins etc and TWO chairs in a double room so often double room only has one chair 
240651,Novotel London Excel, Miserable staff at the bar they are Eastern European so this seems to be their trade mark and the cost of drinks and breakfast is ludicrous , Location for excel 
240652,Novotel London Excel, The rooms were too small for two adults and one child The restroom set up was strange and irritating with the toilet in a separate room around the corner from the rest of the bathroom There was barely any closet space so we couldn t unpack properly and there was no conditioner in the room , Check in staff were very kind and helpful and the rooms were very clean 
240653,Novotel London Excel, My room was extremely basic Looked just like a room in the Ibis but for twice the price No storage no hooks to hang coat or night clothes carpet lifting mirror too small and low for me to brush my hair etc etc, The staff were great professional and friendly
240654,Novotel London Excel, Didn t like being ripped off by being charged 2 50 for a 50p bottle of water Don t care if you re in London or not charges like that will not endear yourself to customers No view to room , the bed was very comfortable room very clean staff very friendly Very handy for O2 
240655,Novotel London Excel, The keycard entry to our room didn t work New card still didn t open our door Took a maintenance man several trips for tools and an hour into our getting ready to go out time before it was repaired and we could relax Quite odd the toilet separate from the bathroom so no handwashing until you went into the bathroom Carpet looked a little grubby Located under the flight path quite exciting for an hour or so , Staff were very friendly and helpful Hotel was quiet and in an interesting location Beds very comfortable Good shower and lots of hot water

240668,Novotel London Excel, Erm the staff were foreign which isn t a problem just a language barrier, Loved the rooms didn t have breakfast as I was dancing accross the road
240669,Novotel London Excel, A let down was at breakfast we were not asked for drink choices at all and I had to ask a passing staff member for coffee after I have finished eating my breakfast Then a middle aged male staff came from behind my back and took the plate from in front of me without saying a word or make his presence known This was very rude and spoiled the otherwise nice breakfast , Front desk staff were lovely and a pleasure to deal with The room was good clean and very pleasant Close to the O2 which was the main purpose of the stay

240694,Novotel London Excel, Poor organisation I clearly addressed the soecial requirements of the room as to have a quiet room and also called reception before my arrival to confirm Sadly I still ended up in a very noisy room with horrible noise from the ventilation I had to waste 1 hour midnight to find a different room The hotel did offer me half the price off my booking and the manager that changed my room was responsible but it was still really disappointing Clearly the special requirements of the room are completely ignored Also the breakfast reception lady was really rude , The superior room is very well designed and comfortable
240695,Novotel London Excel, nothing, location for exhibition excel 5 minutes walk some restaurants are available for eating emirates cable lift is nearby for good viewing of the river and surrounding areas the hotel is quite but needs to be cleaned regularly as carpets and sofas attract dust and pollen the over all experience is very good i recommend to others for staying there if you have a family of 2 3 kids

240712,Novotel London Excel, The drains clearly needed dealing with when running the tap the smell from the sink was quite horrible Did not like to fire alarm at two in the morning but not the fault of the hotel the staff dealt with it reasonably well inside but the control over residents once exited the hotel was poor I would suggest reconsidering the muster area and not allowing them to exit with glasses they could then drop on the floor , Easy access to Excel
240713,Novotel London Excel, Quite a walk after a long day if exhibiting at the other end of the excel centre, Extra touches in the room were really good such as milk cartons in the fridge 3 adults in one room but plenty of space

240717,Novotel London Excel, The bar closed to guests at 12 30am which was a surprise As I would have expected it to be later for paying guests, It was in a great location for our visit to the O2 and the DLR got us into central London easy The hotel facilities were good as everything was available 
240718,Novotel London Excel, Great idea having the toilet separate to the bathroom but no sink to wash your hands Frosted glass door on the bathroom facing into the bedroom is a bit weird when sharing a triple room , Staff were just OK One was good Breakfast was good 
240719,Novotel London Excel, separate toilet from the bathroom which was quite tight to get into the close the door, really helpful and pleasant reception staff had a complimentary late check out comfortable bed easy and good internet connection nice touch to have tea coffee with milk in the fridge nice to have a separate shower and bath in the bathroom

240730,Novotel London Excel, Location is quite far away from central London but the views of the river near the hotel is a nice change from the constant view of busy streets The toilet is a see through glass but with a flick of a button it turns frosted but you can still clearly see the outline of the person showering since the shower is right next to the bed It is kinda awkward trying to shower when you can see your siblings lying down watching tv, The rooms are modern and excellent Hotel had a huge lobby and really comfortable Friendly staff and are happy to assist you in terms of taxi bookings etc Wifi is fast and a huge toilet with a large shower The room has air conditioning Which is a godsend for the really hot summer this year
