427988,NH Wien Belvedere, Although I booked 3 rooms circa two months before our arrival neither one was ready at 15 00 regular check in We have to wait almost one hour the receptionist was not too polite , Location was great close to down town breakfast was very good the bed was small but comfortable 
427989,NH Wien Belvedere, Wi Fi was on the slow side at times but nothing that bad , Excellent hotel in all aspects location facilities transport connections to the airport and the city centre breakfast but most of all people The reception staff was absolutely great multilingual competent willing to help friendly welcoming and always ready with a suggestion or a solution of a problem I would like to mention specifically Maria who offered me a ticket for the concerts of the Vienna Mozart Orchestra at Musikverein A BIG thank you Maria The concert was absolutely fabulous and Mirela the Romanian receptionist who welcomed me and offered a simple solution to a simple issue Please excuse me dear if I misspelled your name Thank you girls you were absolutely fabulous and made me feel special Needless to say the rest of the front office staff was also very friendly and helpful but I failed to remember all the names 
427990,NH Wien Belvedere, Reception lady is professional but very cold , Clean and comfortable room Everything is perfect The hotel offers lemon mint water and biscuits next to reception which is very thoughtful 
427991,NH Wien Belvedere, Price of Breakfast Although a great selection You cannot eat Everything A TOTAL ROBBERY at 25 Only had one Ate across the road at Caf 9 for a complete breakfast , Perfect location for Train and Tram Cheap Travel City Card 72hour 
427992,NH Wien Belvedere,No Negative, Welcoming refreshments water biscuits at arrival in reception was a nice first impression Room was clean and spacious Location is closer to the train station than the city centre but with the tram is easily accessible Hotel is right by Belvedere Garden Palace and is a lovely first close attraction visit upon getting into the city 
427993,NH Wien Belvedere, It might be nice to have coffee tea making facilities in the room Otherwise can t be faulted , Spacious comfortable room the hotel less than 10 minutes walk from the nearest U Bahn station Newspapers to read in the foyer and welcome iced water with mint and fruit in on arrival and biscuits in foyer to greet guests little cards with tourist attractions on reception staff helpful and welcoming I don t think you will find a wider choice for breakfast anywhere in Vienna there is more than you can eat and drink of everything an amazing choice Very good value Also just a few minutes walk to the Belvedere Palace and Gardens and at the bottom of the road to the left there is a big memorial with a fountain that changes colours at night and it is very pleasant and cool there 
427994,NH Wien Belvedere, We had arrived earlier than 15 00 and asked the receptionist if the room is ready She was rude and absolutely not helpful She even didn t looked at me while we were talking The price didn t contained the breakfast , The hotel was very clean The room and the bed is comfortable The room had a view of some trees so it was quite silent 
427995,NH Wien Belvedere, There could have been more light for shaving in the bathroom There was ample space for hanging clothes but very little shelf and drawer space of which there was enough for a one night s stay but which would have been woefully inadequate for a longer stay , This was my third stay at an NH Hotel but my first at this property Nevertheless the staff found my NH Hotels loyalty programme membership number and treated me as if I were a frequent guest at that hotel There was a personalised hand written welcome note from the manager upon my arrival in the room all of my special requests provided for before my arrival including the type and number of pillows that I like The amenities were five star There was free bubbly and flat water waiting for me upon my arrival as well as a tube of chocolate candies M Ms type a nice touch The hotel was very well located next to the Belvedere Palace and the room was large clean and very comfortable 
427996,NH Wien Belvedere, The is no restaurant in the hotel so to get food in the room is difficult to have to ask at the reception to order them for you and them come downstairs to fetch it as it is not allowed to deliver it to the room Most of the stuff is very nice and helpful but some are not , Room is very clean and comfortable spa area is spacious and enjoyable It is really fast to get to the airport by train 
427997,NH Wien Belvedere, Arrived before 12noon room not ready which I understood left bags told room would be ready for 3pm arrived back at 3 30pm room still not ready reason given was that members of a wedding party had been in room hence delay went back to reception several times explained that we had been travelling since 4am eventually got keys for room at around 5pm , Location was great close to number of visitor attractions such as Belvedere Palace which was excellent breakfast was very good
427998,NH Wien Belvedere,No Negative, It is situated in a central location walkable to the Opera House Belvedere Palace etc There are trams running on the street right where the hotel is located The rooms are clean the bed is comfy The breakfast was a little too pricy for us so we did not get extras Overall a clean and comfy stay in the heart of Vienna 
427999,NH Wien Belvedere, Air conditioning wasn t cool enough on our 4th floor so had trouble sleeping The housemaid tried to adjust but no different Breakfast is expensive at 22 and nearby cafe s very average On arrival we parked in side street for 10 minutes to unload luggage and returned to find an unsympathetic parking inspector issuing a 36 fine , This is a lovely hotel We booked a superior room It was huge so loads of room to spread out Hotel is a few steps to tram and only two stops to city Walking distance to Belvedere Palace and Museum 
428000,NH Wien Belvedere, A minor annoyance understandable for energy conservation though slightly inconvenient guests are required to inform the hotel 30 minutes before using the sauna facilities , Great breakfast spread well appointed and comfortable room good sauna facilities a definite plus and dignified location easily accessible by public transport We liked that there were birds chirping outside the window in the morning Also special thanks to Vanessa and the others at the front desk Breakfast crew were all so friendly and helpful too The hotel also recommended the Salm Br u restaurant nearby a great place for dinner Thanks Smooth check in luggage storage and smooth check out 
428001,NH Wien Belvedere, Breakfast cost 20 euro It s insane Overpriced hotel as most in vienna Rude staff during check in They blocked the money on my card then they charged the same once again but blocked money remained blocked 30 days, Location is nice
428002,NH Wien Belvedere,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful Others who have stayed here noted their dismay at it not being located near an U Bahn station however the hotel is about one city block distance from the Unteres Belvedere tram line stop on the 71 line that goes to the Opera Ring area and Karlsplatz U Bahn station U1 U2 and U4 lines Also the staff can arrange a taxi to the airport when you leave so all in all this hotel affords you a little peace quiet from the humming tourist center part of Vienna while allowing easy access to the main shopping tourist spots Other reviewers noted problems with the WiFi but signal strength was more than adequate even allowing for good connection for using FaceTime stayed on the 2nd floor The breakfast was an impressive spread of hot and cold items with plenty of seating in the breakfast room Room itself was clean and on par if a little more spacious than rooms in B B s that I ve previously stayed at just off Karntner Strasse Would definitely stay here again 
428003,NH Wien Belvedere, The hotel was very busy all the time during my stay 3 nights which is not a problem in general Unfortunatly there was mostly just 1 person at the reception who was responsible for check in and check out calling taxis and helping the guests with anything else I wanted to order some food for my room which is not possible since they do not have a restaurant in the hotel They recommended to order from an Asian restaurant The one where they have the menu was finally closed then they promised to find another restaurant where they would order for me Finally they told me i should go to the internet and find something for myself The smell in my room was like being in a hospital Unfortunatly i needed a ironing board which they brought to my room quickly This board was so old that i was afraid to iron my silk dress on it Finally every morning at breakfast i told them that one of their fruit salads already got alcoholic Sorry for all my criticism but this was really a bad experience The building is actually a nice one but management of the hotel can improve a lot , The architecture of the building and a safe wifi 
428004,NH Wien Belvedere, Booking com did not transmit the credit card information to the hotel Due to my late arrival after 6pm I almost lost the reservation but a spare room was fortunately available I was not aware that booking com of this issue and I am rather hesitant to use booking com in the future if a reservation cannot actually be guaranteed even when credit card information is on file ,No Positive
428005,NH Wien Belvedere, Breakfast is very expensive If you pay over 130 for a night then it should be for free Unexpected city tax which was not included to the price that was in booking com It was small amount in euro but still I prefer to pay the final price that was in booking com , Everything was good
428006,NH Wien Belvedere,No Negative, Just a awesome accomodation with fantastic choise on breackfast Clean very quiet spacious room with nice view to Belveder Palace Direct tram to Old Town Famoust Salm Brau beer restaurant just 220 m walk 
428007,NH Wien Belvedere,No Negative, The rooms are spacious clean very big television The staff are great the breakfast has something for everyone It is right beside belvedere gardens and close to the main shopping street 
428008,NH Wien Belvedere, A bar in the hotel would have been a great bonus , Advice readily and expertly given at Reception Welcome warm and efficient Modern rooms in historic property Well placed for access to excellent public transport system Good choice of good quality items at breakfast Good sized desk in room Ample wardrobe space Lifts modern and efficient 
428009,NH Wien Belvedere, Staying at a 4 star you expect something complimentary such as the NH Branded small food condiments which were placed in the room These should be free as at least , We stayed at the NH Belvedere Hotel in May 2017 and it was a great stay The hotel was easily accessible from the Vienna HBF through a subway or even tram Just get off at Rennweg station and you are at Belvedere Staff was very polite and very accommodating The room and bathrooms were spacious You can even get a Electric Kettle in your room free The Hotel is nearby the main Vienna highlights though would recommend to get Vienna Travel pass as there is a tram that runs right near the Hotel No 71 which takes you to the Ring which is the place where all the monuments etc are We took a free walking tour which started from behind the Opera house and it takes you all around the old city about 3 hours Great tour to understand the history and get to know the place The Belvedere Palace is just behind the hotel so you cannot miss it however you take a train from Rennweg to go and visit the SchonBrunn palace Overall the stay at the Hotel was great good location and there is plenty of Halal food joints so don t worry 
428010,NH Wien Belvedere, Late check in 3pm We asked for early check in when booking and they couldn t find any available room when we came , It s close to Belvedere and the city center Clean and comfortable 
428011,NH Wien Belvedere, Hotel was shabby and the carpet in our room was disgusting There were some really nasty stains on it and it was generally grubby The water pressure was low and the shower was in an position on one side of the bath making it difficult to use The room was also very hot but the air conditioning was not working Not a hotel we will use again , Good location with excellent view of the local area Close to Belvedere Park and SBahn
428012,NH Wien Belvedere,No Negative, A very pleasant and traditional hotel with comfortable and clean rooms is located next to the Belvedere Thanks to very close railway Rennweg station and tram stop there is a good connection to the centre to all atractions I got a silent room with a nice view to the garden I felt very comfortable here 
428013,NH Wien Belvedere, There were no tea coffee making facilities in the room and the breakfast price seemed expensive I didn t book breakfast as a result of the cost and found local cafes do breakfast at a more reasonable price , The location of the hotel was great within walking distance of public transport if you didn t want to walk but very close to local attractions We got a taxi to the hotel from the airport but could have easily got a train we didn t realise at the time but got a train back to the airport Staff were great their English was fantastic and they were helpful when asked about public transport 
428014,NH Wien Belvedere, It was unusually hot during our stay at the first days of April and air conditioning system was not yet active Had to leave windows open to let cool air followed by outside traffic noise in , Great location 1 min walk from botanical garden and Belvedere park where you can freely walk relax and enjoy a cup of coffee and an ice cream 5 min walk from historical city center 10 min if you are in no rush You can actually get anywhere in old center on foot the distances in the city center are not that long as they might seem on the map 
428015,NH Wien Belvedere, Interiors are not brand new but clean and absolutely worth its money, Staff is friendly and ready to help Location is not central will take you ca 15 minutes to walk to the city centre but is literally 3 minutes by foot from Belvedere gardens Very good breakfast 
428016,NH Wien Belvedere, We ordered a taxi to the airport through the reception The driver didn t have a terminal for payment by credit card I didn t provide documents on payment for services Didn t provide documents to the taxi company This is an arrangement with the hotel staff and a private person about providing illegal services for tourists I ask the hotel administration to take measures for their employees This is an illegal business in the hotel ,No Positive
428017,NH Wien Belvedere, I found it quite annoying having to use the garage in the other building quite inconvenient with the suitcases especially if the weather is bad The carpets are old and used and there are stains all over the place Whole room stank of cleaning solvents hydrochloric acid which was quite annoying as it was impossible to sleep I realise the cleanliness is important and that the best way to disinfect everything is using it but the stench was unbearable it was everywhere in the bed linens the whole room Really annoying Besides that I am sure it is not recommended for a person to inhale those amounts on a daily basis , It was just a hotel 
428018,NH Wien Belvedere,No Negative, I had a single room with garden view calm spacious comfortable good bedding nothing negative really The breakfast was included in the price and it was quite good variety of fresh produce quality goods The staff was kind helpful and friendly The sauna steam bath is a definite plus I had a good off season rate but the four stars are well deserved Easy access from Renweg S Bahn tram 
428019,NH Wien Belvedere, It should have kettle with tea and coffee in the room, The breakfast and the location is good as it is near train station that goes directly to the airport 
428020,NH Wien Belvedere, There is nothing to mention here , Very good location clean and tidy room with high ceiling and the most lovely and helpful stuff I really felt being treated as a VIP However I observed they treat everyone as VIP Breakfast is fab five sort of smoothies and healthy and not so healthy options too Oh and just to let you know you could choose a glass of Proseco for your Sektfuehstuck Highly recommended 
428021,NH Wien Belvedere, The free WiFi really sucks hard During the evenings prime time it s unusable no matter how good reception you have The shower handle holders are badly attatched to the walls and most of them barrely hold the weight of itself The water pressure in rooms is either very low or the fancy shower handels 10differentwaterstreams are making it worse it really takes time in the mornings , The stuff is always smiling single rooms are great big table and a chair so one can work in the room as well Big comfy beds bathtub in every room In the fitness zone there is a threadmill bench dumbbells and some other cardio machines In the SPA zone there is a finnish sauna always around 90 degrees steam sauna and nice resting room with two heated deckchairs Free apples are also nice 
428022,NH Wien Belvedere,No Negative, The Location was just perfect and the breakfast very rich in variety I loved the smoked salmon with the creamy raddish And the staff was very friendly Will come back 
428023,NH Wien Belvedere, The wifi was extremely slow It didn t even work on most days , Our hotel was right next to the Belvedere Palace It was a nice and safe neighbourhood then again Vienna itself is an extremely safe and organized city There was a tram that stopped right next to the hotel and that takes you to the city center The hotel is old but that s part of the charm The room was extremely spacious with high ceilings We also got a tub Will definitely stay here again 
428024,NH Wien Belvedere, Nothing , Big cozy and comfortable rooms with amazing views to Belvedere palace Great breakfast and fantastic service We got VIP service from Ren Sanchez who was very attentive and helpful We really had a lovely time at the hotel Many thanks
428025,NH Wien Belvedere, That Christmas was over and I had to leave Wienna , Everything Great location room personnel room facilities I would get back the next time and gladly reccomend this hotel to everybody Great value for money too 
428026,NH Wien Belvedere, Worst WIFI Speed Wouldn t let u check in a little earlier Pierre at reception needs to improve his customer service skills , Nice Comfortable Quite Room Great Location Osman and Venessa at Reception were great 
428027,NH Wien Belvedere, Unfriendly receptionist at the check in My credit card was charged at a second time after check in without authorization At check out the hotel did not say sorry at all Even after a week the problem is not solved yet Never again will I stay there , Breakfast was fine and the buffet was open until 11AM 
428028,NH Wien Belvedere, Not exactly central Had a late checkout but maid came knock insistently 2h before , Noble building wonderfully decorated in sober retro style Spacious and comfortable room Quiet area 
428029,NH Wien Belvedere, Please hoteliers make bedrooms dark quiet you re selling sleep , Excellent breakfast Location good especially for train Rooms great especially bathroom cleanliness 
428030,NH Wien Belvedere, I stayed at a room at the front of the hotel There is a lot of road noise The bathroom is tiny and there is no kettle You need to pay for warm water to make some tea The hotel does not offer room service I would not rate this hotel as a four star A few days earlier I stayed at the NH Danube City Although this hotel is from the same chain it was miles better Next time I visit Vienna I will stay there again , The location was perfect for visiting the city centre The bed was comfortable 
428031,NH Wien Belvedere,No Negative, I had a short but pleasant stay Everything was clean and comfy and the staff was nice The hotel is within walking distance from the old town I am a walking enthusiast but I think everyone could enjoy walking from the hotel to the center Overall I d say I paid a fair price for the services offered 
428032,NH Wien Belvedere, Some parts of the hotel are worn out and could use some refurbishing , This hotel is located in an old building near Belvedere Palace Rooms are large and clean reception staff was professional Had a very good stay here 
428033,NH Wien Belvedere, Room itself was a bit worn ou but very spacious clean and fine , Very nice staff visit was just a quick o n stay before a flight public transport and also road connectivity to the airport is great and less than half the price than the NH airport Coffee and juice for early departure 
428034,NH Wien Belvedere,No Negative, everything was great from comfort of the room to the quality of breakfast and the help friendly staff specifically the person in the lobby check in 
428035,NH Wien Belvedere, Slightly out of date at least my room but definitely OK , Well situated near S Bahn to main train station or the airport Had a quiet room facing the Botanical Garden very nice 
428036,NH Wien Belvedere, I have put down a complaint on the NH Belvedere hotel in Vienna on the booking site Booking com We arrived at 6 AM at the hotel we gave the receptionist a knowledge that we are here for check in and that we are fully aware that the check in is not until 3 PM We left the laguage in their safety room and left for a sightseeing of Vienna We even in the morning pointed out for the smoking rooms The booking form clearly states 2 smoking rooms When we came back for the check in at 3 PM they gave us the keys and wanted to send us away in our rooms since the lobby was full of people clearly waiting for check in at exactly 3 PM and not a minute earlier When I asked if the rooms are smoking they said Oh noooo we only have 3 smoking rooms and they are already taken When I tried to explain that we need smoking rooms not beacuse of caprice but beacuse of need the trainee at the reception not the receptionist said that s not her concern and not her problem If I knew that my booking request would not be met I would booked a hotel elsewhere a hotel with a terrace And the girl at the reception said Than wait for the girl from this morning to come it s not my problem I am a trainee here So we took the rooms in order not to wait longer I am absolutely stunned from the behaviour of the stuff I have oral presentation tomorrow on a conference and now I can t focus on my work It is obviously not useful if I state that I want a smoking room in my booking form when nobody respects that Wifi is terrible in my room on the first floor the connection was on and off all the time My room was faced towards the street so I couldn t sleep well It was very noisy and I felt every vehicle crossing down the street , The breakfast is excellent The location is near the centre about 20 minutes walk The interior is ok 
428037,NH Wien Belvedere, The curtains need a black out so that the sun light won t been seen really early , The room is really spacious Has a good decore comfy All the facilities are good Good location Nice view Very near to BELVERDE palace just 3 mins walk The staff is really nice and friendly every day at breakfast they brought a colouring book and colors for my little girl
428038,NH Wien Belvedere, Did not allow anyone to check in before 3PM Tourist arrive from outside Austria at all hours We pay for the room by the day 24 hours and receive less 20 Room was ready at time we arrived 2 PM and we notified them we would arrive via email Your web site falsely states airport shuttle , Food was excellent and everything was clean and maids were courteous We have stayed at Savoyen and Linder Your hotel is now our first choice Keep up the improvements 
428039,NH Wien Belvedere, We couldn t access our room til 3pm although we arrived at 9 30am after travelling by train for 24 hours , Location value for money We ve stayed here 5 times and love it 
428040,NH Wien Belvedere, Everything was good although the breakfast was a bit pricey so we gave it a miss , The location was excellent being only a couple of minutes walk from Rennweg Station and the city centre is withing easy walking distance 
428041,NH Wien Belvedere, Internet speed was terrible It s free but useless We had a maximum of 256kbps meaning you have to wait for web pages to load Seems to me that they only have it to advertise as free wifi , Great rooms Airconditioned nice beds

428044,NH Wien Belvedere, On checkout there appeared to be some problem at reception maybe systems were down receptionist seemed very flustered People were complaining as they had been waiting 20 min to check out and a long queue had formed We were told we had no choice but to wait to check out but we were unable to wait as needed to catch a train so left our room key and told them to debit our pre authorised card which they did , The room comfortable clean and with a view of part of belvedere palace illuminated at night Breakfast included in our room rate of 135 for 2 nights and it was delicious with a lot of choice Location not in the centre but walkable in 20 min Purposely chose it as it wasn t in the centre lovely quiet area 5 min from belvedere palace and it s gardens Renweg train station 5 min from the hotel and provides direct train to airport and Vienna main station Very very happy with this hotel
428045,NH Wien Belvedere, Around 20 minutes to the nearest metro station but very important this is Landstrasse Wien Mitte CAT terminal , Room comfort cleanliness near to City Centrum Belvedere
428046,NH Wien Belvedere, On Jun 30th my husband got an allergy attack so I needed to call a our medical insurance Coris very urgent to get him attention I couldnt make the phone call directly from my room so I call reception to do it for me A woman called Mirella answered the phone and in a very quick almost rude way said sorry Madam I cannot help you with that right now I was asking for a medical urgent situation To sum up same day very late doctor came cause another person from the staff called He got an injection and was bad enough to be taken to hospital But thanks god the doctor was great and treated him in our room so my review is that this person shouldnt work in the front desk of a very well known an important hotel like NH she is not capable to deal with guests I have been all around the world in different hotels and something like that never happened to me , The hotel is very comfortable 
428047,NH Wien Belvedere, The reception staff with a couple of exceptions were universally rude with a truly astonishing lack of customer care Furthermore the location is noisy despite secondary glazing and the breakfast grotesquely over priced My advice is not to stay here , Leaving 
428048,NH Wien Belvedere, There could have been one more chair in the room, Spacious room oriented to a quiet courtyard the girl from the reception went out of her way to find an extra pillow more to my liking
428049,NH Wien Belvedere, I missed little outdoor sidewalk cafes being right outside my hotel However there is a fun restaurant with their own beer brand nearby called Salm Brau , I moved to the NH Wien Belvedere after staying for 3 nights in a nice hotel in the center of Vienna historical area which I really enjoyed From the moment I opened my window I loved the NH Belvedere Outside my window were amazing shades of green tree leaves and birds singing no other sound Later I discovered that the University Botanical gardens backed the NH Wien Belvedere Heaven after 33 days of traveling Europe s cities historical centers The front desk staff were very nice the breakfast room and staff were pleasant the location was great for visiting the Upper and Lower Belvedere palaces and Van Gogh Museum

428051,NH Wien Belvedere,No Negative, We stayed for 3 nights Our room was very clean staff were very friendly and helpful We enjoyed the buffet breakfast We were about a 20 minute walk to a majority of the sites which suited us but the Belvedere Palace was almost next door and the grounds there are beautiful to stroll around There is so much to see but we ran out of time
