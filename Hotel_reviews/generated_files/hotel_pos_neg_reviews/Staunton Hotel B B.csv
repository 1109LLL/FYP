42900,Staunton Hotel B B, The room that we were given was directly behind the reception and main entrance and therefore it was quite noisy with people coming in and out and the activities in the reception area , Location is excellent the bathroom and shower were great Overall well worth the cost for a sort stay in London 
42901,Staunton Hotel B B, Room extremely small bed unconfortable Wifi reception very poor Lack of privacy in the bathroom , Good location Standard breakfast coffee could be better Helpful staff Very clean room 
42902,Staunton Hotel B B, No elevator, The location was very close to the British Museum which was great It was on the bus lines which made traveling around London great The room darkening curtains were wonderful keeping the very early sun out It was very clean The staff were very friendly and helpful The breakfast was wonderful I would recommend this B B to my friends 
42903,Staunton Hotel B B, There is no lift, The reception is very helpful I didn t bring my charger he borrow his to me And he also help me to carry my luggage which is really heavy This hotel is really very good
42904,Staunton Hotel B B, The bath room was a little dated the bath need replacing really and the stair case is steep which is why I gave a lower score for toddlers and baby s but fine for children a bit older its fine Other than that can t fault the place, The hotel is ideally located walking distance to Soho area for Theatre trips and very close to British museum We had a very warm welcome to the hotel and were able to drop our bags off early to explore London Breakfast was very good loads of choice Room was very clean felt safe with 2 children 9 10 
42905,Staunton Hotel B B, Our room we felt was very hot and air conditioning took a long time to cool room down , Hotel was ideally placed for our trip to the theatre and meals in Covent Garden breakfast was lovely including fresh fruit and cereals 
42906,Staunton Hotel B B, Cleanliness in the bathroom there were hairs stuck to the walls in the shower when we arrived , The full English breakfast It was exceptional to wake up to the smell of freshly made breakfast every morning The beds were comfy 
42907,Staunton Hotel B B, Bathroom was clean but plumbing stuff from 19th century Shower water tap falling down everytime you touch it Warm water or Hot water in the shower no way to get cold water High traffic on the street from 6am to midnight take your earplugs if you plan a nap, Old english style but really charming and comfortable Individual Air conditioning in the room Nice and professional staff Breakfast made by order Metro station 5 minutes walking distance
42908,Staunton Hotel B B, Nothing, The best things about The Staunton Hotel were the very helpful friendly staff and the great location especially if you are going to theatre land I can thoroughly recommend the cooked breakfast which seemed to be freshly cooked which is very unusual these days Just around the corner from the hotel are a good selection of individual coffee houses and small restaurants 
42909,Staunton Hotel B B, The shower was hopeless for a grown man Room was in a third floor even though we had kids with us no lift , Friendly staff I liked the breakfast except the coffee The location is excellent 
42910,Staunton Hotel B B, Bed was the most uncomfortable bed ever come across in a hotel Side of bed seam broken and sharp Dated decor seriously needs upgrade A real hike to top floor no lift so up spiral stairs with luggage Not easy, Location and breakfast
42911,Staunton Hotel B B, Room window was facing the street on the ground floor the street was noisy Room was very small anyway as all accommodation in London Breakfast quite poor not much options for those who are not fans of English Breakfast Price is too high for this value , Location is great Clean and comfortable room with private bathroom 
42912,Staunton Hotel B B, Terribly over priced Zero charm badly in need of renovation and super stuffy without the a c on We didn t like the hotel at all and would not recommend it to anyone Bathroom in particular was in bad shape The toilet took 10 min to re fill after a flush , Hotel location was not too bad and the breakfast was quite good 
42913,Staunton Hotel B B, Adding some vegetables to the breakfast will make it even better Wifi coverage was good but there was no data reception in the room , The hotel is very nice and comfortable It is situated in a great location It s close to Oxford st and within a walking distance you can find many restaurants and pubs on the other hand the street is rather quiet so you get a comfortable and relaxed experience The breakfast is good the staff is very nice We forgot to bring some things and they gladly helped us 
42914,Staunton Hotel B B, Mattress was terrible Cheap and worn could feel springs poking through Bed comfort is the most important element of any hotel stay and this was a real let down , Air conditioning in room was good and new bathroom was nice 
42915,Staunton Hotel B B, The fan not working in the bathroom Awful smell in the bathroom during the night which seeped into the bedroom Bit of a juggling act getting a case up the narrow staircase , The room was very nice The beds very comfortable

42919,Staunton Hotel B B, We were on the third floor with just an overnight bag no lift so with a bigger suitcase it would be difficult as it s quite a narrow staircase Arrived at the hotel to check in rung the bell as there was nobody at the desk and was kept waiting for more than five minutes before somebody came to let us in, The room had just been refurbished so all very clean with a very nice bathroom Very good choice for breakfast Good location for Theatres and shopping

42925,Staunton Hotel B B, The hotel could do with some updating a lick of paint here and there but nothing that effected my stay , The location was absolutely perfect it is central to everything and a minutes walk to the hustle and bustle yet so quiet Beds were like sleeping on clouds and hotel was spotless
42926,Staunton Hotel B B, The basement room we were initially given had windows onto the trash area and the a c emitted a cloying odor when switched on So our first night was a bit stuffy Also that first room s toilet was the size of an airplane s But our new room was all terrific and the opposite of the basement room , Great breakfast location room size and comfort once we requested a change from the basement room we d been given

42932,Staunton Hotel B B, Having to climb 3 sets of quite steep stairs get to our room The smell of shake and vac around the place Needs quite a bit of TLC to landing and stairs Unable to accommodate all guests for breakfast had to wait for table Would not go back to this hotel but loved the area , The cooked breakfast was good and the bedroom room itself was ok The vicinity of the hotel was ideally situated for sight seeing and central London 
42933,Staunton Hotel B B, We had booked 3 rooms for a group of 10 for a hen weekend the rooms were comfortable but they are looking a bit tired and in need of a referb one of the toilets smelt like sewage and there were some ants on the breakfast table in the morning , The location was perfect and the price was really good for London the staff were all very nice

42936,Staunton Hotel B B, The reception staff after check in were kind but could possible use a little education of the facilities offered at and around the hotel , This is in a perfect location not right in the middle of Covent Garden so there is not the noise just a 5 10 minute walk Perfect if going to the theater or want to do some shopping 
42937,Staunton Hotel B B, Building over all very run down Some areas could be easily improved ie clean conservatory roof this would give better impression Window ledges in room need good clean Carpets throughout have certainly seen better days I paid 139 British pounds Could have stayed at Thistle Euston for 150 b b, Staff pleasant and helpful
42938,Staunton Hotel B B, Rooms in quiet 3rd floor have lower ceiling and smaller windows as directly beneath roof Breakfast really great apart from weak filter coffee Better drink tea and have a fresh espresso in a coffeehouse nearby as Waterstone s coffee corner Gower St Torrington Place , Comfortable bed Served breakfast full English and continental Really hot and strong shower All together nice quite personal B B atmosphere
