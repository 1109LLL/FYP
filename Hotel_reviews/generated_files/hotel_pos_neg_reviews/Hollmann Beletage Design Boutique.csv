352575,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, Instructions re operating the relaxation room in the suite would have been helpful I m sure someone would have told us how to use it if we had asked but didn t want to be constantly bothering reception More TV channels would have been welcome even if it was just Sky news or CNN , The staff certainly contribute to the success of this hotel They were all very friendly efficient couldn t do enough to help you Would agree that the entrance to the hotel does not attract but once at reception that all changes We booked the suite it was more like having our own apartment Located one floor up in a different part of the building it was quiet clean very spacious Kitchen area lounge dining room large bedroom modern bathroom shower relaxation area separate WC Tasteful combination of modern fittings with original older building Pointed out to the maid that the bath water did not seem to drain away properly technician was there to sort it within minutes Wish other hotels were as efficient Breakfast Dishes were freshly cooked to order Hotel Restaurant recommendations were very good

352578,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, Bed not very confortable , Loved the modern hospitality of the hotel Small details and attentions to make you feel at home rather than in a hotel There was a hand written welcome note with my name on a board outside my room The toiletry products are great 
352579,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique,No Negative, This is an absolutely fantastic boutique hotel with a location that couldn t be better 5 minutes walk from St Stephen s Cathedral south and Schwedenplatz Station north The rooms are spacious and luxurious the breakfast is incredibly delicious and the service is impeccable I can t recommend this hotel highly enough if you re traveling to Vienna definitely stay here

352581,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, May be the WC can be improved , A lovely suitable location in the middle of historical Vienna and lots of shops and restaurant The building is an antiquity the suite is designed in a rustic yet modern way We loved it it is private and quite and feels at home The breakfast area is an open kitchen stations the variety is well studied healthy And simple as if your own chef is cooking at home The staff are kind happy And helpful We loved it 
352582,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, Nothing all good, Great location spacious room very good shower Loved the breakfast probably one of the best I have had throughout my travels Free WiFi 
352583,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, I would put the carpet looks very pure without , Location is exelent Hotel looks not attractive enough from outside but when you see everything from inside you understand that somebody did super job Sure quality of the rooms could have been better if you compare with Chinese for example But there are a lot of small things which create really comfort atmosphere 
352584,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique,No Negative, Wonderful breakfasts with innovative menu and serving style The heated wet room in the suite was fantastic to relax and unwind with a bottle of wine after a long day sightseeing
352585,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique,No Negative, Room was spacious and well designed This was especially important given that we were traveling with an infant which required a pack n play in the room Our son enjoyed playing with the rubber duckies and the antique telephones The breakfast was probably our favorite part of each day in Vienna Staff was welcoming and professional Location cannot be beat plenty of great restaurants and sites within a very short walk 
352586,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique,No Negative, Fantastic hotel excellent breakfast friendly and personable staff Room was clean and spacious Amazing central location 5 minute walk to St Stephens Cathedral 
352587,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique,No Negative, This place is a gem Beautifully designed rooms super comfortable beds thought through concept and beautiful decor If you are looking for friendly comfortable quirky and a tad different then this is the place to go When wandering through the different areas of the hotel you will find little special details everywhere to put a smile on your face The breakfast was lovely The only downside of our stay was that we could only stay for one night 
352588,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, Slightly too warm inside but controls in the room are easily used and adjustable , Staff were very friendly and approachable Breakfast is top quality freshly made and from a selection that changes daily Decor was pleasant We also liked how personal the experience was they leave you little welcome notes on a chalkboard outside your room s door 
352589,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique,No Negative, good location in walking distance from CAT station and same distance to places to visit friendly and professional staff they really care about your stay in small details and do remember your preferences and choices along the stay delicious eco breakfast and kind tea and snack served in betw 2 6 pm clean quiet pretty nice Italian cafe with good quality cousine nearby open until 11 30 pm just in case you d decide not to go too far from the place of location
352590,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, I wonder about no carpets or mats when one gets into bed in particular I very much enjoyed the wine in the mini bar and my son the beer in the lounge Access on the property to hard alcohol might have been nice addition The spa gym was an added benefit I would have welcomed a more open space or a window for the tread mill maybe even a second choice of cardio equipment and some free weights The tread mill sunk in the astroturf was an interesting idea tho , The breakfast was truly amazing Not only delicious but very high quality ingredients and a bit of a change each or our three mornings Staff were delightful and very helpful The hotel atmosphere was warm and welcoming despite the different entry and the very modern decor Truly a hidden jewel in a central location 
352591,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, Wood floor made a little bit noisy and Hotel entrance is quite hard to find at the first time , Good location and great Breakfast nice and neat Room is also very nice and comfortable The staffs are also very nice and helpful 
352592,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique,No Negative, Cozy rooms with accurate care for facilities it is indeed a home away from home All details are taken into account from the soap to the breakfast the free whiskey or the piano Just a comment if your room is on the upper floor you will be awaken by the noises comming from the breakfast room
352593,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, Bath room space especially for the showering should have an enclose space Bath tub is not useful as the space is too tight , As a boutique hotel the staff paid personal attention to the travelers For instance the chef will cook your breakfast egg dish to your wish The location for the hotel was important as it is located in the old town area and served by two underground and very near to tram bus stop 
352594,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, Not having a porter bellhop to help with luggage Not being able to get an additional cot for child even though the booking said I could request a cot on top of the pull out bed but found out this was misleading that the extra cot was the pull out which meant by goddaughter who is 4 had to sleep on a makeshift bed the ottoman and end table with numerous pillows and comforters , The Spa was a big hit with my god daughter and her parents The overall charm of the suite was excellent The breakfasts were outstanding 
352595,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, A minor complaint the breakfast room was too warm, We loved this hotel The location was perfect enabling us to easily explore the delights of Vienna The breakfasts were superb the best out of all the hotels we stayed in on a 2 week tour of Europe The staff were very friendly and a very comfortbale room delivered the complete package 
352596,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, We weren t able to stay longer Also reception CLOSES from 10pm 7am which is a bit odd but I understand why they don t need someone there 24 7 , This is the COOLEST kookiest quirkiest absolute most fantastic boutique hotel we ve been to We usually stay at larger chain hotels but this was the first time traveling to Vienna and I figured I don t want to spend the big bucks on chain hotels we won t be spending that much time in the room and the reviews have been great here so let s give it a shot OH BOY was I glad I listened to the reviews the Hollman is a TRUE GEM Upon arrival you think you re in the wrong location The entrance is in the most non descript un assuming low key location All you see is a small orange awning with the hotel name Walking in it feels like you re going to a speak easy My wife was so far not pleased Go though another door to the main elevator where things begin to make sense At reception we re greeted by two extremely gracious and friendly hosts they were so great during our stay happily answering all my annoying tourist questions We re given the low down on the facilities and shown to our room A GIANT hand written greeting is waiting for us at the front door to our room Wow Completely unexpected fun and unique The room is gigantic High ceilings hardwood floors mini fridge TV and spacious bathroom free wifi too We were completely thrown aback by the size of the room It was ultra modern and very clean and quiet Located in the center of the busy city we COULD barely hear a horn honk in the evening Excellent job on the sound proofing The hotel is perfectly located in the Inner Stadt It s in the ultimate tourist location You can walk ANYWHERE in the Ringstrasse go back to the room to freshen up and leave again to continue exploring Other than the opera and train station we didn t need a cab once while we were there Breakfast is included in the room fee and what a breakfast it is It s a literal feast from the moment you sit down 
352597,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, The bath towels could be bigger and softer , Very good location in central Vienna The breakfast was delicious and the staff was very kind and friendly 
352598,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, no view at all, large room modern and new comfortable beds including the third bed in the room perfect location in the center of everything and yet quiet
352599,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique,No Negative, Everything The location could not be better The helpful and kind staff the beautifully decorated rooms and the rest of the hotel Not many rooms it really feels like home 
352600,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, Nothing, Our stay was wonderful The staff was great informative and up to the hotel moto feel at home Our crib came with a baby shampoo and mam suckkers Excellent location One of our best stay
352601,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, The only downside I can think of is there was no view from our room as looks onto a courtyard There are some rooms with street views though , Very friendly staff V comfortable room with lovely unusual bathroom Fantastic location and superb breakfasts to set you on your day of sightseeing In very quiet street 
352602,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique,No Negative, Quirky hotel in a great location with friendly helpful staff Our room was spacious comfortable and quiet Loved the free snacks and beer in the afternoon and whisky at night 
352603,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, I felt at times the desk staff seemed a little rattled with requests had previously arranged an extra bed for my daughter and was told the price via email when I inquired about the setup staff looked a bit dismayed and told me the house staff has gone home but I suppose I will get it done Amd that is the wrong price inspite of showing the letter from the email Not really the best answer considering I was asking in the morning for later that evening with that we didnt bother asking for advice etc again so while everyone was friendly I think a little work could be done there Overall an excellent hotel and I WOULD DEFINITELY stay there again And once again brilliant setup and people for the breakfast bravo , Wonderful clean hotel Very comfortable beds The breakfast chefs and waiters were above exceptional They could not do enough for you Delicious food at breakfast 
352604,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, It was very hot that weekend and it is Europe so don t expect American air conditioning systems There was air conditioning and better than most places in Europe but took a while to get cool , Great location large spacious room with two large windows yet very quiet Small couch for extra seating fruit in the room upon arrival Breakfasts are made to order and plenty to eat Staff very friendly and helpful Snacks and beverages available late afternoon Very comfortable and welcoming 
352605,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, The room which we did select when making reservations was a little ackward with the sink behind the bed The bed platform took a little getting used to as you had to step down to the room floor , Staff were great Answering questions etc Our host at breakfast the chef made everyone feel right at home in the home styled kitchen area 
352606,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, Smell in common areas most likely cooking residue It s an old building , Breakfast custom cooked a big hit Convenient before long day Like a restaurant no B B feel which we do not like 
352607,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, Parking is very confusing as you have to pass down several winding one way streets to get to the hotel but then not go so far as to pass the parking in a nearby courtyard Once we knew where to go the courtyard was safe and very close walking to the hotel entrance , Everything was great the staff oriented us to all the cool features of the hotel provided stamps for postcards and were very helpful with suggestions for music and dining Breakfast was excellent Our room was really clean with really neat features like a charming CD to play and pez candy I would highly recommend this hotel and would love to stay there again 
352608,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, the quality of the linen and towels lower than the standard and not in line with the global high level standard of the hotel and the amenities the spa it is just a sauna but to say the truth for a weekend you barely have the time to go anyway, Excellent location A mix between B B and hotel great decoration original and comfortable the breakfast room and the living rooms
352609,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique,No Negative, Once more Hollmann lived up to its reputation Third time we re there always the same fantastic service superb breakfast the little perks such as free tea and drinks in the afternoon wonderful design of the rooms lightly refurbished now the excellent central location just off the Schwedenplatz Looking forward to the next time

352620,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique,No Negative, The Hollman is one of the friendliest and fun hotels I have ever stayed in Nothing is too much trouble for the staff On my birthday the chef made me a cake and it was presented to me with a glass of champagne The whole experience was brilliant 
352621,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, With the basin right behind the beds and a separate toilet chamber without any wash basin a tad odd for someone used to a large integrated bathroom But this is minor on service cleanliness and staff no issues at all would definitely stay here again , Great location steps away from St Stephens cathedral and host of nice restaurants close by Warm and helpful staff Room was spotleess and reasonably spacious by European standards Not much street noise Nice breakfast service with eggs to order and cheese meats and the works A pleasant experience overall

352626,Hollmann Beletage Design Boutique, Nothing was bad but compared to the other breakfasts we have had this one lacked pastry or sweet breads and the service was a little less coordinated than we would have expected , The place is very cleverly designed and has interesting features everywhere The common rooms are fun to sit in and have a sip of brandy or iced tea The air conditioning in the room was excellent and much needed in a heat wave The location is very central They located a great guide for us who gave us a very entertaining day full of information and fun They directed me to the riverside running path and in general were very helpful
