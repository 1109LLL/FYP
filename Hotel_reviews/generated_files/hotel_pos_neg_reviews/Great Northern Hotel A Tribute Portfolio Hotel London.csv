356577,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Reception is so unobtrusive as to make the arrival process confusing and underwhelming Paid nearly as much as I did at the Renaissance across the road when last staying in the area and there is no comparison dus to the level of attention to detail for example my room had chipped paint a stained desk blotter similar hallmarks of a high volume room the St Pancras Renaissance allows no such things I m afraid that if I were staying in the area again and on a similar budget I d opt for the Renaissance I d go to the GN bar again though , Attractive room clever ise of space fantastic location for shopping and restaurants and for Eurostar travel next day Loved the bar great food and cocktails Loved the help yourself pantry

356581,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London,No Negative, We stayed here because of the British Airways IT disaster The personnel made an effort to turn it into an agreeable experience and assisted with rebooking as best as possible A stark contrast to how we got treated by BA 
356582,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Glass doors to the bathroom Beautiful doors but not really appropriate Why was I asked to leave 50 deposit in case I smashed anything , Access to tea and coffee in the pantry 
356583,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The room in the attic on the fifth floor was miniscule Two people cannot walk round the room in opposite directions No wardrobe one tiny cupboard to hang clothes a gents dress shirt will be rubbing on the floor when hung up No drawers you will be living out of your suitcase the whole stay No bath shower only , The hotel staff from reception bar dining and cleaners are all great The food is very good 
356584,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Rooms were a bit small and it was all very pricey , Very quiet bedrooms and exceptionally comfy beds Facilities really good and I liked the pantry at the end of the corridor Ideally located for Kings X and St Pancras both trains and tubes and easy to get to and from

356587,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The only thing would be clearer signing to direct you to the Reception Desk from the entrance door, A perfect location for St Pancras and King s Cross station only about 50 yards from the hotel doors to the Eurostar Check in and even closer to King s Cross The fact that the hotel is not immediately next to the main road means that the rooms are nice and quiet with no noise at all heard from the lively bar on the ground floor and the quieter cocktail bar on the first floor We had a Couchette Room which although compact is fitted out to a very high standard and perfect for an overnight stay before onward travel by Eurostar A particularly nice touch was a pantry at the end of each floor with a further selection of complementary drinks confectionery and cakes 
356588,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, NO SHOWER WATER ALL OVER THE PLACE SILLY IDEA trying to shower with hand held shower spray, LOCATION SPOTLESS PANTRY IDEA FAB PLEASANT HELPFUL STAFF
356589,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Size of the room And no Bath tub in the bathroom For its room rate this is very poor After a long day s travel do they not think soaking in the warm bath can really make a difference Power shower may be fashionable but with the popularity of the spa treatment in this country they should consider some people especially women appreciate a nice bath time , Location right next to London Kings Cross Station
356590,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, All was first class, Staff outstanding Location excellent and development of the area fascinating We knew the area 24 years ago when it was less than salubrious 
356591,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Poor value for money The room was extremely small and cramped This was even after paying for an upgrade The snacks consisted of Luke warm coffee biscuits cake and jelly babies Not worth the money , The location was very handy for the train station We took a nice walk along the canal to Camden market from the hotel 
356592,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The room was so small the upgrade was not worth the money snacks consisted of biscuits and cake and it was not good value for money Would not stay here again due to lack of value for money , Location was good 
356593,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Before retiring I travelled widely and never paid for a room on booking All rooms could be cancelled usually up to 16 00 on the day of arrival Friday 12 May We stayed in a room at the opposite end of the third floor to the pantry with a good view of the Kings Cross plaza Although small and not having a shower it was satisfactory for a one night stay There was a free standing bath with no shower only a hand mixer with no bracket to put it above you The pipe union leaked flooding the floor and the bath drain was very slow to empty both reported to staff There was nowhere to hang clothes apart from a small wall peg with three coat hangers There were no drawers for undergarments socks etc There was good wifi Although there were two USB charging connectors there was only a single 13A socket Tuesday 16 May This is the main subject of this complaint We stayed in a very small room which would best be described as single The room was about three feet wider than the double bed that ran the full length of the room The bed in the room was up against the wall with no access to the other side apart from scrambling over There was nowhere to hang clothes apart from a wall peg with three coat hangers There were no drawers for undergarments socks etc There was no wifi signal Although there were two USB charging connectors there was only a single 13A socket There was no view from the window On the 16th we arrived late at night tired after an all day journey so did not feel like rejecting the room at 23 00 I complained in the morning and was told it was a standard room It was not fit for a couple and thank goodness we only booked one night I could not believe this in the 21st century I booked this hotel as part of a luxury Steam Dreams Pullman tour pulled by the Flying Scotsman steam locomotive This included a three night stay at the Balmoral in Edinburgh which was excellent , The pantry and the room decor Comfortable bed once you overcame the access issue Very handy for Kings Cross station 
356594,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Not being able to walk around the bed We were offered the option of a superior room for an additional 40 but declined because we were departing before 6 am the following day , Exceptionally helpful staff at reception when we arrived 
356595,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, A little signage to show the actual entrance to the hotel we had to ask and once inside there was no indication of where reception was We went to the left lugged suitcases up some stairs only to find reception was actually to the right on entering , Lovely room we were upgraded Wonderful sweeping curved hallways Loved the bar watching the mixologists Perfect position for our trip on Eurostar the following day 
356596,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The main bar area was fitting in design with the hotel but the atmosphere didn t sync with the hotel s classy and elegant vibe the choice of music was clubby and was so loud that it made it impossible to hold an intimate conversation Wouldn t stop me from staying at this hotel again but I d give the bar a miss and seek out other more intimate and cozy venues , My stay at GNH was nothing short of fantastic Beautiful and well appointed rooms extra sound proofing of the windows made for a quiet and restful sleep Staff from the reception to the bar was friendly and accommodating 5 star service And as a solo female traveler the security access to hallways where rooms are located required a key was much appreciated 
356597,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, It is expensive to stay here Our return to the Great Northern Hotel, As I have said before it is the staff that make this hotel special They are excellent professional helpful plesant without being too familiar 
356598,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Room a tad small but is a small boutique hotel , Room gorgeous if a tad small Very clean and friendly staff Each floor has a pantry fresh coffee tea homemade cakes and fresh fruit Lovely idea Fantastic location above Kings Cross station stayed here before Highly recommend it 
356599,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The room is rather archly described as a couchette This means that however compact the design there is no room to swing a cat I had arranged to meet a friend at the hotel and we could barely pass each other in the room and had to take tea standing in the pantry For the same price around 250 GBP you get a spacious room at The St Pancras Renaissance On the other hand the staff at the Great Northern make you feel more welcome , The bed was enormous and very comfortable The high tech desk was fun with charging points and switches for electric curtains and blinds I played for ages Immaculately clean Extremely friendly staff at reception and in the bars My luggage was whisked away and carried up for me as a matter of course The bathroom was stylish and well appointed with a powerful shower and rapid hot water If I d been staying longer I might have found the wardrobe space a bit sparse but there were the usual extras for a room at this price safe minibar etc A shared pantry with delicious complementary cake biscuits sweets and tea and coffee making facilities There were also two computer stations which I didn t need as free wifi was excellent The biggest advantage and my principal reason for staying here was of course that you can hop onto the Eurostar in the morning with the minimum of fuss 
356600,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, At check in I was advised that the room I had booked was not suitable and I should upgrade As I had just spent 24 hours on a plane and was very tired I agreed to the 40 upgrade on reflection I think I was taken advantage of No power point in bathroom otherwise excellent ,No Positive
356601,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, For a single night stay solo I could not fault this hotel However I may have found the room on the small side if accompanied by my partner , Excellent service from all staff reception and in restaurant Great location for travelers from Kings Cross Great restaurant Room quiet couchette stlyle very comfy for one person on a short trip Good tea and coffee in room Pantry a real bonus Cleanliness excellent 
356602,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, the only possible complaint might be the view of a roof But everything else was so good it paled into insignificance Besides you can t do much about the view , Having the pantry with free snacks and tea and coffee was great Incidentally the tea bags were exceptionally good never thought I would say that about a teabag haha 
356603,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, There was a light in the bathroom under the sink that we couldn t turn out , The pantry with freebies at the end of the corridor and the free films 
356604,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The rooms were tiny I specifically upgraded to the slightly larger rooms on the top floor The issue is that the top floor has a slanted roof and the room is already tiny so it really feels like a room for hobbits The images of the rooms on the website are actually renderings so it s an inaccurate representation of the room Also there wasn t really a view of anything except the roof of the train station for us which was a shame , Location location location This is located in such a convenient spot right above the train station and tube and everything else The rooms were also clean and wifi was decent I liked having the mini kitchens with snacks on each floor 
356605,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, No kettle tea in the room In Britain Coffee maker only For tea one needs to leave the room and wander to the kitchen at the end of the corridor Room itself odd shaped the bed covered the entire window no space to walk around the bed at all The floor of the bathroom was either dirty or the material simply doesn t clean well , Quiet despite perfect location in busy area Nice view from my room over the top of kings cross station 
356606,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, A proper pot or cafeti re of coffee at breakfast should the norm Two cups of coffee for 8 at 4 a cup each time is pushing it a bit even though the service is attentive and faultless , The pantry at the end of the corridor is a great idea 
356607,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Checkout staff weren t particularly friendly Otherwise fantastic , Lovely rooms well decorated fab breakfast Liked the kitchen available on each floor where you could find a selection of teas coffees and cake 
356608,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, We went for brunch the next morning to the restaurant only to be told that we could sit in the bar or down stairs as they were fully booked We opted for the bar and stayed 1 hour whilst we ate The restaurant during this whole time was only at half capacity That aside the food was amazing I highly recommend the crab and avocado on toast THE BEST, Staff at hotel amazing and very accommodating The bonus of the Pantry offering cakes sweets fruit TeaPig Tea s and Nespresso coffee s complimentary was a lovely bonus
356609,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Confusion around an extra bed for a baby was finally satisfactorily resolved , Plum and Spilt milk restaurant was good Hotel is very nicely decorated and superior materials used Rooms are quite small even the upgraded ones Lounge Bar is quite noisy Access to public transport outstanding and Camden area is improving 
356610,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Reception was undersized for property Entrance was too discreet with little signage esp within lobby , Decoration fixtures were exceptional nice bathroom 
356611,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The reception area is small and crowded for a hotel of this category We got a complementary upgrade to a bigger room This was sized as expected which means normal rooms must be small There is no proper walk in shower but a large bath tub instead with a shower but this is not a good solution as one can slip and water can go everywhere If you are close to the kitchen which we were there will be noise at night Facilities are very basic It is not clear how they got five stars or what that implies for the difference between 3 4 and 5 stars We did not mind but it is not so clear how they can justify the price charged The breakfast is too expensive in particular as it is not at all difficult to get very good quality breakfast very close by So we did not book it , Friendly staff Flawless internet Kitchen on corridor with complementary hot drinks and snacks We received an upgrade when we arrived The room was nice and bright with big windows and a high ceiling 20 discount for the restaurant however we did not make use of this offer The location is of course superb if you have to catch a train in the morning Nevertheless it is well insulated and not noisy The heating air conditioning is quite I do not understand other people s complaints about lights that could not be turned off This is possible but the switches are not all in the most obvious places Bath robe hair dryer complementary mineral water etc exist like one would expect from a 5 star hotel The TV is very small and unimposing 
356612,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The receptionist could not find my booking I even gave her my mobile to look at the email She then asked me for my passport I thought this was odd given i live in the uk and am british i have never been asked for it before in any other hotel i had seplt my name correctly and she had the email then she looked and remarked my name on the booking was the other way around not sure why this has not happened when I have booked before using this service not sure what the receptionist was up to i had a busy evening planned and had friends waiting, almost everything
356613,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, I booked a specific room at the hotel to get a different experience than the first time we stayed We were upgraded but not told until we asked about the room Felt too awkward saying I didn t want the upgrade so we just took it , The complementary pantry on each floor was a great touch I liked that the cake in the pantry was not the same as the previous stay 
356614,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The restaurant while it is now one of the best in London has become very expensive The breakfast is truly excellent but really doesn t justify its price , This is our favourite hotel in London and we stay here whenever we come to this city It s location right next to St Pancras station makes it the best place to stay if you are arriving or departing on the Eurostar service Kings Cross Underground also being on the doorstep is central for all locations in the city although can be a bit of a pain if traveling from Heathrow on the Heathrow Express as you have to come from Paddington The rooms are great and the added touch of The Pantry on every floor makes it very special Thoroughly recommended 
356615,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Couldn t find a fault , Wonderful location actually adjoining Kings Cross station but no noise whatsoever and across the road from St Pancras International Easy buses and tube into West End Staff were wonderful Fabulous d cor and comfy bed 
356616,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Lines at check in could be shorter Great restaurant but difficult to find hidden in hotel , Great location next to Eurostar station Great restaurant Plum and Spilt Milk on the first floor
356617,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The bed and pillows When I book a room that is very important to me , Loved the pantry at the end of the corridor The Reception staff were very pleasant the restaurant and food was excellent along with the staff 
356618,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, To get into bed I had to climb over the bed as it was against the wall with the end of the bed in a similar position I did not pay 199 00 to go climbing ,No Positive
356619,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, It was difficult to find the hotel inside the Train Station Rooms are tiny Had to make an upgrade but the room was still very small , Location and interior design
356620,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Room was small with little storage Check in area also very small so gets crowded easily , The staff went above and beyond to be helpful They would actually walk us out of hotel to a location to help us get location correct 
356621,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The room was a little smaller than I had expected however it had everything I needed , The bed was soooooo comfy staff very friendly and the pantry Breakfast and lunch were amazing 
356622,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, We have stayed at the property previously and enjoyed our experience however the one item of disappointment is the cost Usually you can expect to pay between 100 150 GBP per night however on this occasion the property we assume as the stay crossed over valentines day was charging 230 GBP which was an excessive uplift On arrival we went to our room which was a standard category to find that it was tiny The room only fit a double bed and bedside desk One side of the bed was against the wall and window so you would have to climb over your partner to get out of bed or to the bathroom and the foot of the bed was against the wall Although they tried to romanticise the room as innovatively designed and reminiscent of old sleeper cabins it was far too small to be comfortable or functionable This meant changing rooms and paying an additional 50GBP 280GBP total to be able to walk around either side of the bed in a room that was of a standard hotel size Very disappointing , The Great Northern Hotel is in a perfect location for people traveling in to London by train Since St Pancras and Kings Cross have undergone redevelopment over the past few years the area is now full with restaurants bars and some shopping making the area busy and popular The hotel has a great bar that has a wonderful atmosphere The hotel has also created galley style kitchens pantries at the end of each corridor of bedrooms providing facilities for tea coffee daily newspapers biscuits etc which is a lovely touch 
356623,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Everything was perfect, This is officially the most comfortable bed with the most comfortable pillows the most decadent bedding in London The latest cation is great The the Bartender in Plum Spilt Milk does a mean Gin Tonic 
356624,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, All fine, Excellent breakfast comfortable bed and lavish bedlinen good location despite being off centre for theatre district but Underground easy to get there 
356625,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, , The personnel was extremely attentive The room was quite big and comfy and so the bed The place seems quite safe though located near the railway station As I had to travel by rail the location is just perfect St Pancras International is less than 100 m away I really enjoyed the a la carte breacfast Will come back 
356626,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Room tiny had to climb over partner to get in out of bed Public areas over crowded therefore nowhere to sit , Excellent breakfast Great staff
356627,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Entrance to the hotel is appallingly badly signed from the station or from the street I walked all around trying to figure out how to get in before entering via bar and asking then I was sent in right direction but mistakenly I went upstairs to restaurant rather than down to unsigned again hotel reception The street entrance needs a clear large sign on the awning saying HOTEL not a small metal sign on only one side of the entrance door saying hotel name after one has read name of the restaurant and given up Door to lifts could be better signed inside too on the bedrooms floor , Everything especially pantry concept on each floor though I would suggest more choice of everything there
356628,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Front door was not obvious and then 2 doors when you enter we went left to begin with and ended up in the lift lobby had to back track and go right to get to the reception , Staff were very friendly and helpful and the facilities in the pantry at the end of the room corridor was a nice touch with a good selection of complimentary drinks and snacks 
356629,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Ironing facilities in room always useful , Lovely room great shower Lots of extras like free movies excellent mini bar use of generously stocked kitchen on each floor 
356630,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, For a five star hotel the room was pretty small but you can see that one coming it s central London The hotel would really benefit from a gym and pool The pantry could have been stocked with something more interesting than sherbert lemons jelly babies caramel wafers and victoria sponge You know like cereal bars or decent fruit , Everything was cleverly designed and presented the staff were extremely friendly and helpful The room fittings were really very luxurious Access to the hotel was also very easy from Kings Cross The pantry was a nice touch and had lots of great tea and coffee options 
356631,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Bar bill was a little heavy but this is London and room could have been a little warmer the heating took a while to bring the temperature up , This was our third visit and it s our favourite hotel in London A little quirky the end of hall pantry but always well presented clean and welcoming Being so close to Kings Cross is also great 
356632,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, One small thing the courtesy lights in the bathroom was a bit bright and kept me awake but I am a light sleeper , Fab hotel in a great location with the newly regenerated kings cross area all around it some superb restaurants along with their own plum and spilt milk which was gorgeous too
356633,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, There was nothing we didn t like , Everything was perfect was amazed that we got a free upgrade when we arrived will definitely stay there again fantastic food staff amenities the room was beautiful absolutely loved our stay would recommend to anyone Thank you great northern hotel 
356634,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Sadly I would like to go back but it would probably be as 2 adults and 1 child and they don t have a room to cater for that which would mean I would have to use an other hotel instead of paying for 2 rooms Perhaps they could add a extra bed in the premium rooms to Cater for 1 child, High quality room and pantry was a classy touch to offer guests that little bit extra Room was of high quality as good as any 5 star I received comp upgrade 
356635,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, We didn t like the fact that our room didn t have a seating area apart from a small seat at the desk so had to sit ON the bed to relax or watch TV This was not very clear in the room description Also a very small amount of hanging space , Staff very friendly and helpful we also liked the 24 7 pantry for tea coffee 
356636,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The gentleman in front of us to check in was given a triple room I pgrade We checked in a second after it was my partners 30th birthday and we were given 1 complimentary drink 2 1 for each of us would ve been nice , Beautiful design peaceful comfortable rooms great communal pantry area location to kings cross st Pancras and Euston
356637,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The bathroom doors a little too transparent when using toilet , Perfectly located for our needs The restaurant was superb the meal as good as we have ever eaten Loved the idea of a pantry on the floor Some hotels are mean with free coffee GNH was very generous Friendly staff We always change hotels when we go to London From now on we will use this hotel
356638,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Door key didn t work got help from staff but still didn t fix it and was an annoyance Could do with more variety of drinks in the room rather than having to go out of the room to the pantry just for a cup of tea More bottles of water in the room as on 1 bottle of still and 1 bottle of fizzy for the whole stay , Bed was super comfy and the bed sheets were so softy and silky Pantry was amazing to get drinks and cake but a little inconvenient when early morning and need a drink Overall a lovely and comfy stay 
356639,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The provision of toiletries was inadequate and we did not like the lack of space in the room we had booked so had to upgrade Frankly overpriced for what you get even though the location is very good, The location was very good for our purposes close to the train stations we use and just down the road from Sadlers Wells
356640,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, We booked a standard double room The room was very small but the bed even smaller It was only 1m35 wide The room was so small that both persons had to get into the bed from the same side The bed was certainly too small for two standard persons When I told the reception the answer was that next time I had to book a superior room The very small bathroom was also very cold The heating in the bathroom was not working while it was freezing outside For all this we payed 249 without breakfast Never again , The locaton next to Saint Pancras station
356641,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, No drawer space no problem for overnight stays or business people , Small but stylish room with great bed V quiet even though next to the station Bar busy and fun good bar food Main restaurant excellent Love the pantry on each floor with comp coffee papers sweeties and mince pies
356642,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Nothing It was perfect , The decor of the hotel was beautiful and stylish sympathetic to the history of the building with a modern twist The rooms were small but very cosy and the idea of having a pantry with tea coffee and complimentary snacks at the end of each floor was lovely The bars and restaurant were beautiful 
356643,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Extremely small room 5th floor not like any 5 hotel I stayed in in many many years Not 5 really No lounge to work in just a very very busy bar, Nice bar and restaurant
356644,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, There were water all over the floor in the bathroom when taking a bath in the bathtub The television did not work half of the time The bed was really small for two people ,No Positive
356645,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The entrance needs to be more clearly marked with a sign inside pointing to reception Upstairs the corridors are spacious whereas the bedrooms are tiny especially for two They are not designed for couples travelling with suitcases , The hotel has been stylishly renovated with considerable attention to detail It is an interesting and original building The staff were welcoming and attentive the breakfast was delicious and healthy and made with very fresh ingredients 
356646,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, I have never been able to find fault with this property , Clean spotless would be more accurate cute rooms comfy beds convenient location and you won t be able to hear any noise from the train station great restaurant but the best part hands down is the front desk staff If you are lucky enough to check in during one of Edward s shifts you will feel like the only guest in the hotel Everyone in the staff strives to make you feel like the most special guest they have ever had It s a great way to start your stay in London 
356647,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Breakfast service is slowed down by over popularity Not enough trained staff compared to morning activity a lot of non residents come for breakfast The fact that there is no gym is a minus , Breakfast is truly excellent with great choice of English goodies Haggis Kipper full English Dinner is good Wine by the glass a little pricey but good choice Beds are comfy but could be bigger Super king is needed Access to a pantry on every floor is a great idea lemon cake at the pantry is truly excellent 
356648,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, A small desk or buro with a comfortable chair can be very practical sometime, Very comfortable Bed Good to have a pantry on the Floor Good breakfast Nice overall atmosphere
356649,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London,No Negative, Great location and a fabulous room overlooking Kings Cross Square All the staff were so helpful and friendly and the cakes in the pantry were delicious
356650,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, I expected the superior double room to be slightly larger in size , The room was very clean quiet and the staff were friendly There was a little pantry on the 5th floor which was fantastic and gave the hotel a real home feel 
356651,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, For a supposed 5 star hotel the rooms are pokey and small I upgraded to a deluxe room which was only marginally larger than the tiny regular room No tea making facilities in room Having a pantry on each floor is not convenient if you want a morning tea in bed No cupboards for clothes just an open hanger No desk in room Hardly room to even walk around the bed For a hotel of this price it s exceptionally bad value for money I would not recommend and am highly unlikely to return , For a supposed 5 star hotel the rooms are pokey and small I upgraded to a deluxe room which was only marginally larger than the tiny regular room No tea making facilities in room Having a pantry on each floor is not convenient if you want a morning tea in bed No cupboards for clothes just an open hanger No desk in room Hardly room to even walk around the bed For a hotel of this price it s exceptionally bad value for money I would not recommend and am highly unlikely to return

356655,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The room was very small and the toilet cistern run all night Very limited on space to keep your clothes Being on the 5th floor there was no view from the window , The hotel was spotlessly clean Having the towels changed every day The nice touch of having water available in your room 
356656,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London,No Negative, Confortable bed but the duck feathers doesn t help for a good night allergy Air conditionned is too fresh the bathroom Nice and warm I would like To find a hair dryer so a very good hotel

356658,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, I was disappointed that there was no sense of the original railway hotel although we did not use the restaurant or bar , Excellent location for St Pancras and restaurants Staff very helpful and friendly room comfortable and pantry available for snacks

356673,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, This time I booked a King Room I was only there one night and was given a small double room The reception tried to tell me that this was a King size in the UK where I ve lived all my life and I do know what a King bed is found it a bit of a condescending excuse and as I was there only one night and tired I didn t escalate it but it did annoy me and probably won t go back due to this An apology would have been totally acceptable if they didn t have the room I booked available Honesty is the best policy , I ve stayed her a few times since it opened and in fairness the hotel is hard to beat Only ruined by a member of staff having a lack of training 
356674,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The bed was too high and it was not possible to walk around it A sophisticated coffee making machine was provided in the room but no ordinary kettle We did not like the ribbed glass door to the bathroom It lacked a feeling of privacy We thought 320 for one night without breakfast was rather expensive , The location was perfect for St Pancras International for travelling on an early Eurostar train A pantry at the end of the corridor offered tea making facilities and light refreshments The coffee machine was too complicated for us to use

356697,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Nothing, From first entering the GNH to leaving nothing was too much trouble This hotel and the staff are faultless I had worried that being adjacent to a main road and two stations that noise would be an issue However inside the soundproofing is superb The aircon also was silent The room was immaculate as was the bathroom and we wanted for nothing I do encourage you to make use of the pantry on the floor where you can help yourself to complimentary hot drinks cakes biscuits and sweets Really can t recommend this place highly enough We will definitely be returning

356702,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The standard rooms are for those prices minute the hotel itself describes them as couchettes which considering they contain a bed and precious little else is a better description While I realise that this hotel is in central London the rooms compared to other hotels are overpriced Room service up to 11 p m only a la carte dishes from the restaurant again an expensive option , The staff went to a great deal of trouble to sort out problems and offer me a room I would be happier with It is certainly very convenient for St Pancras station and the Eurostar terminal which is why I booked it in the first place as it is literally across the road The helpfulness of the staff and the cleanliness of the hotel did offset some of the problems I faced however I am not sure I would stay there again

356723,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, As we are over 80 a shower rather than a very high to us bath Otherwise every thing else was superb , As Eurostar was over 2 hours late it was comforting to know that the G N H was just across the road from St Pancras

356726,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, 1 The let them eat cake philosphy is daft Whilst we realise breakfast is not a feature of the booking we made but if you offfer a galley facility surely coffee and croissant is more palatable in the morning than a slice of CAKE 2 Woken up at sunrise as the curtains in our room did not fuly close 3 Insufficient hanging space Small wardrobe was understandable but that needs backing up with hanging hooks We had coats and stuff lying on the floor 4 Wanted a nightcap in the bar on arrival back from West End but was dissuaded by banging house music played at a volume that was too loud for a non club environment, Location design Obliging staff Reasonable cost
356727,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, No drop off place so had to park a few 100 yards away and carry bags rather than drop off in front of hotel and then park , Really convenient location for early start on Eurostar Great restauarant

356761,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The bathroom is only equipped with a bath no shower and thus it is somewhat tricky to have a quick shower The floor ends up very wet as there is no shower curtain but overall thats okay The noise from cars outside The hotel is isolated from all the station sounds announcements trains but our window was facing the road which was quite noisy even at night with all the buses , The room is spacious and very modern looking with huge windows and lots of light The location is perfect there is an exit which leads you directly to Kings Cross station The staff is very kind and the whole experience is just great

356765,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Room not ready till 4pm offered complimentary drink and free breakfast but would of been disappointed if I had paid Not worth 25 Service excellent though No tea making facilities in room but were available along the corridor with complimentary cakes For a King room could just squeeze past wall to get into far side of bed and bathroom too close to bed for any privacy when using toilet, Location was great clean comfortable room staff helpful
356766,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, the bed was pushed up against the window so not easy to manoeuvre around with the bench at the end of it, Fabulous shower with good toiletries
356767,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Would have been useful to have an explanation of what all the switches in the room were for , Proximity to Kings Cross Excellent though expensive dining room Friendly service Proper loose leaf tea with breakfast Good WiFi TV had Sky sports channels 
356768,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Maybe the addition of a small fridge in the room Not much of a view from our room , Nicely appointed rooms with a lot of atmosphere good location Overall enjoyable experience 
356769,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Being a solo traveller it would have been a lot better to have a view from the window in the room Room did not have the wow factor for the money that was charged It was suitable for a solo traveller but nothing special , A warm welcome The staff were helpful and accommodating It was lovely to have a pantry on each floor with a good range of items such as coffee tees cakes and biscuits Also the toiletries in the bathroom were great quality 
356770,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, not many communal areas apart from bar and restaurant , pantry was a nice idea but no considerations for people with dietary issues provided here currently Room very clean and comfortable 
356771,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Room interior detailed design was very poor and clearly done and approved by people with no eye for detail Lots of little things could be much improved , Staff cleanliness location all excellent
356772,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Breakfast was a shambles poor staff did not get what we ordered took over an hour from getting down to breakfast having to wait in a side bar and eventually get into breakfast room to be served by staff who frankly were clueless 5 Star I think not Shambolic , Great location
356773,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Didn t like the arrangement of the room the person sleeping next to the window couldn t easily get out of bed very bad design , Free coffee and mince pies
356774,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The bedroom was TINY I have never stayed in a hotel before where you can only get in the bed on one side as the other side buts up against the wall , The room was fitted out beautifully and the bar restaurant communal areas were very stylish

356779,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, none, This lovely Old Railway Hotel has been sympathetically renovated with original features like cut glass patterns in mirrors while having 21st century feature like electronically controlled blinds Position also perfect for those departing or arriving in London on Eurostar Food in the restaurant was also excellent both for dinner and breakfast with attentive staff
356780,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, If I m being picky I found the lighting in the room quite dull and the view out of the window wasn t good Other than that everything was fine , Great stop over if you re traveling from Kings Cross The room I stayed in 205 was pretty basic but clean and comfortable Pantry on each level was a nice touch I have stayed in hotels all over the world this one is nice but quite overpriced due to location

356783,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, nothing , When I made the reservation I mentioned we were staying at the hotel as a treat for my partner s birthday Even though I had booked the standard room the hotel upgraded us to a better room with a bath This was greatly appreciated The rooms are really nice and have a homely feel about them Even though our room was situated at the side of the street with a very nice view on St Pancras station we could hardly hear any noise from the street The bed was very comfortable We also appreciated the free selection of films to watch The bathroom was very nice indeed and the bath tub was amazing We also enjoyed the pastries and sweets in the pantry next door And last but not least the 12 o clock check out was also appreciated I always hate to have to hurry in the morning to get ready for a 10 o clock check out 
356784,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London,No Negative, Everything The hotel was amazing The food in the restaurant was amazing Staff were all very helpful and we felt were very comfortable in their jobs And the pantry at the end of the corridor was such a cool idea Will definitely come again 
356785,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, No emailed invoice to follow as promised on check out Also my customers have complained that the 50 per authorisation was taken from their card and told it would not be retured for 5 10 days which is not right , Location faciltiies hotel is a great standard 
356786,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The pantry wasn t quite what we expected Wasn t topped up with fresh cakes etc Just had some sweets and mince pies on offer , Clean funky and very comfortable Staff in hotel were very friendly and accommodating 
356787,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London,No Negative, I loved the room decor and the quaint little pantry with snacks and papers The location is so handy 3 minutes from Tube to room and the view over the station was addictive 
356788,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Lack of comforts in the room Such as no clock no outlets in bathroom no desk no drawers for clothes no shelf and or table for items near mirror in room and in bathroom , Location was great Food was very good Very clean 
356789,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Bad smell in the room I was told this was due to new carpets I had one of the superior rooms and it was a lot smaller than the picture indicated , Excellent staff and location
356790,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, It is definitely not 5 Tiny room with no room to move or store clothing Very difficult when 2 adults are sharing a room Most uncomfortable night s sleep I have ever had One of the teacakes in the pantry was out of date , Nice furnishings Availability of movies Pantry with complimentary cakes Location was good Elegant furnishings 
356791,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, No bad experience but the public area on the ground floor with reception and bar was smaller than I expected This did not really affect our stay Will definitely use again , The staff were very professional The restaurant for breakfast was one of the best The Cubitt room we stayed in was well kitted out and the pantry arrangement was very useful Location could not be better for us 
356792,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Bed small but our fault for booking a double room and not King Didn t like the automatic service charge added to food and drinks from the bar , Pantry was amazing
356793,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Not enough water in room Would have liked more of a selection and extra water to have been in the pantry , Very friend y and helpful staff Checked me in early Nice lay out of the room Very comfortable bed and pillows Loved the idea of the pantry on each floor 
356794,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Resturnt didn t live up to the exspectauon or prices charged Dinner for one 80 the standard should be better Sorry but the decor doesn t make a restaurant , Proximity to the station modern decor clean reasonable size room by london standards Frendly staff 
356795,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Nothing at all , The hotel and staff were absolutely fantastic even the bar staff were curtious extremely friendly and helpful It s the third time we have been here and the service gets better every time Gosia one of the staff customer service was exceptional we will be back soon 
356796,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London,No Negative, Fabulous decor throughout hotel Loved my room So elegant Stylish bars and restaurant Pantry on every floor with complimentary goodies Gorgeous bathroom Friendly staff Loved it all 
356797,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Very odd finding the lift We re given a disabled room and told there were no others then I rang down and said I was not happy and suddenly there was another room Should really be given the option at booking especially as this was a no refundable room , The pantry and location
356798,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Unfortunately because the room was located on the 5th floor near the door leading to the lifts it was very loud when shutting everytime someone came into the corridor I probably woke several times during the night because of this If the door shutting mechanism could be adjusted so it was quieter when closing it would make a big difference to anyone sleeping in the room , The hotel location was excellent lovely room and comfortable bed Good facilities liked the pantry 
356799,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, A little hard to find the entrance , The staff were very friendly particularly on reception where I was given a very friendly welcome and everything was explained to me very clearly 
356800,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, No bad experiences Toilet in room wasn t as clean as it should have been but otherwise 100 , Perfect hotel in every way This is a true 4 star hotel Would not hesitate to stay again 
356801,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London,No Negative, This is a stylish hotel which has recently been considerably refurbished in an excellent location both for travellers arriving in London from the north and for access to the various attractions offered by the city it is between King s Cross and St Pancras stations The breakfast was excellent the room very comfortable we were offered a complementary upgrade but declined it the room we had was more than adequate for a one night stay 
356802,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, No problems, It is very convenient for us we get off the train and there you are my brother has mobility problems so this is so helpful We also meet with family at night in their excellent restaurant Despite the position he rooms are very quiet and comfortable It is pricey but the advantages for us are such that it is worth every penny
356803,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Not a bad experience just a little diasppointed I had not fully understood the size of the couchette room After all it does show a table and chairs on the webpage for the room so an assumption it would be snug but somewhere to sit at least No Only on the bed and for two people even at a special price not really worth the money to be honest My husband was there with me and we danced around each other trying to get dressed and ready to go out A beautiful hotel but seriously these rooms should be sold to solo travellers , Beautiful boutique hotel love the pantry on each floor So clean and staff though not over friendly not unfriendly Really is lovely 
356804,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The only minor point was that the bed was only accessible from one side which made access a bit difficult had to crawl over my partner to get in and out , Guest pantry on each floor with coffee facilities papers and snacks Well designed room with USB charge points by the bed 
356805,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, There was no milk in the fridge for coffee and the pantry was being cleaned so staff wouldnt let me make one I concede that the pantry has to be cleaned and it was unfortunate timing It would not deter me from staying again , Location excellent and very nice welcome on arrival Beautiful building 
356806,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, room wasn t ready at 14 30pm had to wait 10 minutes for a room with a shower very long wait for breakfast 25 minutes for hot drinks and another 20 mins for breakfast the waitress had forgotten us Very small room, location Food was fabulous
356807,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The breakfast was entirely false advertising Selection of fruit was green apples and red apples I cake NO bread no toaster No croissants bagels nothing , Excellent quiet room Staff were very helpful 
356808,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, I thought the food in the restaurant not a good value , An old building completely refurbished i n a clean modern style The rooms are smallish but twith beautiful bathrooms and interiors Location excellent near large tube stop and Eurostar But soundproofing takes care of all the London noise 
356809,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, It was a little noises but given the central city location is understandable The sound proofing makes a big difference , The location was great The hotel was decorated to very high standards and was very well appointed The Plum and Spilt Milk restaurant was a massive bonus 
356810,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The bars are frightfully expensive you d pay just as much for cocktails in a premium West End Knightsbridge hotel for shorts cocktails , Loved the feel and vibe of the building cool and modern spaces Great bedrooms BUT not large sufficient though as it s a city hotel Two great bars ground 1st floor expensive though for drinks as you d expect Great restaurant The Plum Spilt Milk for breakfast lunch dinner 
356811,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London,No Negative, I liked the room which was more than adequate for one person although may have been on the small side for two of us I also liked the shower room and the fact that bathrobes and slippers were provided The facilities were great and the pantry provided somewhere to make cups of tea 
356812,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, It was very expensive and the check in process was very slow, Perfect location for what we needed stayed on the first floor above the bar so a little noisy on an evening
356813,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, when I came to check in with the booking I had made they told me they didnt have a room they said booking com had sold me a room when the hotel was full The truth is that they sold my room for more money than I had paid due to high demand The two idiots on the tiny reception were clueless and couldnt care a toss they didnt try to help in any shape or form but the bar manager was fantastic much more professional in offering us a drink on the house even he remarked that my treatment was terrible , the bar manager
356814,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Others have already mentioned a couple of points and I heard another customer raising them when checking out too I think both need to be considered 1 the bathroom has patterned glass in the doors as well as a gap where the two half doors almost meet in the centre As such the bathroom doesn t offer very much privacy sound or vision especially as rooms are quite small Adding a curtain across would be a simple and valuable touch 2 the hotel often has an event wedding held there This is fine and the hotel is very quiet however guests are not told until arrival that this means the bar and restaurant are closed to guests earlier than usual so you can t drink or eat there I understand why but we could and should be told earlier so other plans can be made , The hotel is in a great location and despite being in a station it is surprisingly quiet Very handy for the tube rail or taxi and right by lots of places for food or essential item shopping as Kings Cross and St Pancras are lovely iconic stations now Rooms are clean and the pantry on each floor is well stocked and a great idea The bar is good with great cocktails and nice atmosphere 
356815,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, No bath same cake each day in pantry no where to sit with 13 year old eg lobby for hot chocolate in evening, Free coffee tea cake biscuits fruit and jelly beans in Pantry lovely idea Secure entry Peaceful feel in Crentral location Films and bottle water included 
356816,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, On booking with Booking com I requested If possible a bath we were allocated room 102 which has a lovely free standing bath Unfortunately the hot water supply was poor lukewarm slow delivery so that the bath was unusable The concierge tried to remedy the situation to no avail so that even in the morning we had poor ineffective supply To give credit where due as a result of this problem the duty manager waived all charges for our stay , Very attentive staff at reception Ideal location for St Pancras and Eurostar De Luxe superior room with its own Nesspresso machine a shared pantry with fruit cakes and daily papers inclusive 
356817,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, My television didn t work and a had to move rooms I was offered free breakfast but I had already paid for it so instead I was given a free drink It was also difficult to find your way in to reception , The location the view from my room the comfortable bed
356818,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Very small reception which was hard to find if you hadn t been there before Noisy throughout the night with returning guests Managed only 2 hours of sleep Reception staff informed on our departure but they weren t particularly bothered , Location for Eurostar services
356819,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Couchette was a little awkward with only one side to get out , We stayed over night prior to our trip to Paris We only met the reception staff and they were brilliant Friendly efficient and helpful Because of them I would rerecommend this hotel to my friends
356820,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Not bad but when busy restaurant is very loud and hard to hear yourself talk Need tea making facility and kettle for weary travellers as well as coffee and small milk supply of some type Some wine as option in room Facility to iron clothes without having to refer to staff all the time More improvement than a gripe , Friendly staff at reception and very attentive wait staff in the fantastic restaurant Great baths really relaxing
356821,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Tiny understaffed reception area for a 5 star hotel When attempting to organise luggage drop off from rental car reservations were unable to transfer a call to reception and reception simply did not answer their number , Funky room great shower excellent location if using eurostar very hard to access by car Shared kitchen on each floor with coffee and snacks a good innovation Good bar and bar food 
356822,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Having stayed in this hotel a couple of weeks ago I was quite disappointed with the level of service offered this time around The room was located on the 1st floor and there was noise coming from the hotel bar ,No Positive
356823,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Bed could be softer Maybe offer the option of a mattress topper , Great boutique hotel with friendly helpful staff Nicely designed room The pantry at the end of the corridor is a great idea Bed a bit hard but lovely crisp sheets 
356824,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, We were booked into a superior room and it didn t come with a bath There was a double shower but i ve never stayed somewhere in a higher than standard room and not had a bath ,No Positive
356825,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Need a sign saying go right to reception otherwise you have to drag your suitcase up an down a few stairs not needed when you have a heavy suitcases , Pantry is a great idea Surprisingly quiet room no road or rail noise at all 
356826,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London,No Negative, Great concept and attention to detail loved the stylish railway theme Our couchette room was cosy and very well done The stylish bar and service was perfect for a drink We had an early train to France the following day and the hotel location staff quality of room and service combined with the railway theme was the perfect start to our holiday The pantry at the end of the corridor is a great innovative idea and well stocked with quality English teas coffee and cakes I applaud everything about our stay My gorgeous girlfriend particularly liked the shower acoustics and mirror behind the head of the bed We would happily return
356827,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, We would have liked some drawers to put sweaters in It would have been nice if the bar would serve croissants with their coffee in the morning , I especially liked the coffeemaker in our room and the pantry at the end of the hall Good lights Furthermore the location was excellent for our Eurostar travel The young man who showed us the room was very helpful and friendly 
356828,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Would hv prefered a guard standing near entrance for security at night especially that the hotels location is delicate, The room was spacious Locatiin very convenient
356829,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, there was absolutely nothing that I didn t like , I choose this location for the easy access to St Pancras International across the street I took the Eurostar to Paris and Brussels The hotel the restaurant the bar by far top notch The staff was outstanding couldn t do enough for you 
356830,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The positioning of the bed against the window meant that the room was ideal for a single occupant but not for a couple, Modern boutique style hotel with a free pantry facility and well appointed rooms
356831,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London,No Negative, Stylish hotel which is well appointed Nice touches like kitchens with good facilities Staff were very well presented helpful friendly and efficient
356832,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, In my room at least there was lack of space and so you couldn t go around the bed , I liked very much that they had in every floor a corner that you could make coffee or tea and enjoy it with cake chocolate bar or caramels Very tasty and full of choices breakfast 
356833,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Room was only big enough for a single bed yet a double bed was pushed up against the side wall making it extremely difficult for one person to get out of bed , Position and pantry 
356834,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Could have done with a fridge for the drinks I got a late deal on the room but don t think I would have been happy about the small albeit well designed room, Boutique feel to the hotel the pantry range of snacks in room The hotel had an individual feel about it
356835,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, No view as looked out onto domed roof, Very clean room had all that I needed apart from teabags and a kettle in the room Not everyone likes coffee Room was on the small side Pantry useful but would have liked a hot chocolate option for drinks
356836,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London,No Negative, very convenient for euro star absolutely excellent great view so quiet in such a vibrant part of London comfort clean and excellent breakfast Only mild criticism was finding the entrance 
356837,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, I may as well have slept on a block of concrete It was one of the hardest most uncomfortable beds I ve ever slept in and I wouldn t return for that reason alone , Great location and friendly staff Surprisingly quiet with no noticeable train or traffic noises 
356838,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London,No Negative, Perfect for an overnight stay before catching an early Eurostar Our room had a view of St Pancras clock tower which was stunning Good dinner in the restaurant 
356839,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, This didn t detract from our stay but did want to leave a warning for American s booking the room with a king sized bed by American sizes this is actually a queen bed , The absolute best part of this hotel was location It s located with one side attached to the King s Cross Station and across from St Pancras With Kings Cross St Pancras Underground having as many tube lines going through it as it does we found ourselves able to get almost any where in London with usually one line and never more than 2 Additionally Kings Cross has plenty of places to grab a quick bite to eat before enjoying the sites Although the room was not large by American standards it was spacious enough for two adults and two suitcases without us tripping over each other Considering the busy location with constant traffic in the area the hotel was absolutely silent We opened the window once and were amazed at how much noise the walls and windows were able to filter out Not a single siren penetrated the room of which there were plenty as I have experienced in many other city hotels Our favorite feature of the hotel was the pantry on each floor This had a Nespresso machine and tea kettle and was always kept clean and well stocked with coffee pods enough styles for everyone s tastes tea and a few tasty sweets pastry which was pleasant to start and end the day with The first floor also had a computing center with very easy to use wireless printers we sent something to print from our laptop in the 4th floor room and were pleased to find it waiting for us as we left the hotel And on the laptop subject the WiFi was very reliable and faster even than what we have at home 
356840,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, There s no hot water served inside the room you have to go out to the pantry for a cup of tea it s really not convenient , i like the bed only it s comfortable 
356841,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Room service staff knocked on door after cleaning the room to check if the room is cleaned One day after the room was cleaned i was in the bathroom and the room service manger knocked the door and she entered while i am in the bathroom, Staff was friendly and bed was comfortable
356842,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The shower did not heat up and it was too hot in the room But we are confident that if had had the time to wait the shower would have been put right and the night receptionist was able to override the room thermometer , The staff are marvellous and are the hotel s biggest plus point friendly without being over familiar and professional and helpful at all times The food is delightful and we really like the pantry facility 
356843,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Nothing , I loved the pantry it was so convenient The rooms were amazing and the staff were so nice and helpful The location was fantastic allowing us to explore London and enjoy a day trip to France 
356844,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Reception failed to explain to my wife how to use the room key to access the locked corridor leading to confusion and irritation on arriving late in the evening However the staff immediately apologised for the error with the offer of a complimentary drink which we did require but appreciated as an acknowledgement of that had occurred , Excellent location for travelling to Kings Cross and from St Pancras High standard of room apparently an upgrade

356847,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, No drawers and limited space for hanging clothes Breakfast was good but expensive Nice to have a Nespresso machine but there was no milk in the room yet there was a minibar fridge Had to get a mug of milk from another fridge along the corridor Also only one stick of sugar a bit mean , Great location for St Pancras Kings Cross station nice style good quality of furnishings friendly staff Nice big twin shower Complimentary coffee and bottled water 
356848,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, No comfy chair to sit on in the room just a stool which I put against the wall to lean back The bed was very high and was a bit difficult for me with being short and stiff hip But great comfort for sleeping , The shower was great and the bed comfy
356849,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Small pokey room Very expensive Poor restaurant Not very polite staff, What was to like under the circumstances Avoid go to the Premiere Inn at least you know what you will get even if it isn t that much cheaper 
356850,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, too many steps in reception small entrance for managing cases however porter very helpful , Great location for station Very clean room Very helpful staff Lovely breakfast Kitchenette on our floor with free cake and tea 
356851,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, They seem to not have bell boys which means the front desk chaps have to help you move heavy bags They are happy to do so just wish they had proper baggage assistance , Friendly Staff and will go out of their way to assist you Early check in is never a problem 
356852,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Minor point but the pillows were too soft so need extra ones in the cupboard , The location is unbeatable The breakfast is the best in Europe and the Pantry at the end of the corridor is a great and unique idea to real top it all off The room was quiet

356855,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, All good but just wish there were greater concessions for single guests Don t wish to compromise on the luxury of a double room but feel 230 for a one night stay is a little steep , Staff very professional helpful Able to get into my room earlier than anticipated which was very useful Location was excellent particularly as development of surrounding area is looking
356856,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, I was woken at 4 00am as a result of someone yelling loudly and aggressively in the hall outside my room The yelling went on for a while and then the person began to knock and finally to hammer on my door while continuing to yell loudly It was a bit frightening I called reception who said that the police were on their way Not long afterward things quietened down but unfortunately I could not get back to sleep, The room was compact but very comfortable and attractive and the location was ideal I stepped off the train from Edinburgh into the hotel 
356857,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Prices of the drinks in the bar One gin tonic one small beer was 17 Definitely would never buy a drink there again , Location very comfortable bed
356858,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Breakfast was expensive for what you got and could have catered for Children a little better mini Full English etc , Hotel was beautiful lovely art deco feel to it and very luxurious so a treat for me They were very accommodating for checking in early too
356859,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, breakfast It looked and tasted as though it had been under hot lamps for a couple of hours and the waitress pinched my paper saying that she thought I d finished with it , the evening staff and reception
356860,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Bar staff looked like he couldn t be bothered and bar prices steep but I guess that s London for you , Excellent location for travelling on Eurostar The rooms are very comfortable and spotlessly clean and the added bonus of the larder on each floor was a real plus point Would certainly recommend 
356861,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, At breakfast in the morning we watched one of the staff scrape the toast to remove the burnt areas then blow the crumbs off with his breathe Not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel , Great shower
356862,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, The pillows were too soft for my liking Even piling up all four didn t help , All of the complimentary offerings are great Free films a lot current and not even streaming on Netflix They have a pantry with tea espresso and free sweets and cake to go with it A little bar if you d like to eat there This hotel is exactly at King s Cross About five feet round the corner Can t beat the location 
356863,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Rooms Very tight Athough perfectly kept and very nicely decorated the space was extremely small relative to the price being charged We had a Cubitt room so one of the larger rooms and still had the toilet literally 2 feet from the head of our bed This was our first stay in London so don t have much to compare to but for price of room would have expected larger footprint Restaurant We were running late one morning and so decided to have breakfast in the Plum and Spilt Milk onsite restaurant The total invoice for a breakfast for four and nothing extravagant was ordered regular eggs and bacon was a little over 100 pounds The environments was nice but certainly not worth the extra lift on the invoice Food was fine but value was not there for what we experienced and left a very bad taste in our mouths so to speak in terms of value overall So to sum up way too expensive for what was offered We have stayed in some very posh hotels in our travels and this one breakfast was one to remember for not the right reasons We chose to go elsewhere for the remainder of our stay , Room was extremely clean at all times and very well kept facilities overall Location was perfect on all major tube lines close to train station Slight mix up with rooms and the staff followed through on an upgrade at no additional cost for our second room to compensate from a customer service perspective Nice touch with the complementary water in the room mini bar and the pantry goodies on every floor 
356864,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Breakfast was freshly cooked and lovely but I asked for bacon and egg off the traditional brekkie and did not want it served in a bap , Pantry at end of corridor
356865,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Nice rooms but poor room layout bathroom night light was a little annoying as the bath room had a glass door which faced the bed Could benefit from more diverse bar snacks olives spiced nuts etc , Great location we were travelling on the Eurostar the next day less than 50 m to the terminal Great restaurant and bar Very helpful and attentive staff
356866,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, I m not sure I would give this hotel 5 stars The reception staff was uneven Some very good others not Housekeeping didn t refresh the minibar or replace glasses , I booked this hotel for its proximity to Kings Cross Railway Station We had very early and very late train times and it was convenient It was rather far out for other venues however Super fast free wifi Nice pantry with coffee maker and cake 
356867,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, It took 3 days to have the Iron sent to my room The towels smelled like they were used to dry a wet dog and the room was more fitting of Antman in the micro universe Too small by far , The Location is great Having a Pantry with tea cakes was a novel idea High standard of cleanliness 
356868,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, Everything was great If I had to say something bad then perhaps the television remote wasn t the most responsive , Comfort luxury and the helpfulness of staff The pantry was excellent too 
356869,Great Northern Hotel A Tribute Portfolio Hotel London, No a bad experience as such but found the lack of access to both sides of a double bed incovenient during the night You disturb the other sleeper , Liked the convenience of The Pantry Great to make a drink read paper first thing
