124401,Hotel Xanadu, The breakfast was disapointing as there was not alot left even thou there was still half an hour left for breakfast What we did have was lovely but there was no cooked breakfast left , The room was inviting and bed very comfy like sliding in to a marshmallow The staff are really friendly and helpful 
124402,Hotel Xanadu, Lack of hooks and place to hang dressing gown or towel Small fridge ice machine would be nice, Good locations with good links to London Heathrow Tip TAKE ununderground to South Ing the 65 Us to Bond Street outside hotel 
124403,Hotel Xanadu, The main bedroom lighting was one very stark central white light , Really charming very helpful staff Very comfortable bed Excellent location Very clean Fabulous shower Nice pictures on walls Staff brought an iron and board up to my room very helpfully 
124404,Hotel Xanadu, Would prefer a friendlier restaurant , The location was perfect for us right in the heart of Central Ealing Staff were courteous helpful and friendly without being overbearing Perfect Like the glass lift 
124405,Hotel Xanadu, Air con a bit noisy and non auto adjust I think My friend did not like glass sided lift on street side as we were on 4th floor and she is a bit queasy about heights , Central location in Ealing Also fairly close to tube Ealing Broadway for going other parts of London Comfy bed 
124406,Hotel Xanadu, Bed is very comfortable but pillows are too soft and un supportive, Location is excellent close to shops restaurants and Train stations parking is available at Ealing Broadway shopping centre 12 for 24 hours 5 minute walk away 
124407,Hotel Xanadu, Noise from air conditioning Light from corridor very bright No fruit teas available , Bed was very comfortable Room was very quiet except for noise of air conditioning 
124408,Hotel Xanadu, Very disappointing experience I booked this hotel for our special occasion 4th engagement anniversary and wrote this in my comment I asked for a nice room I was looking forward to see the surprise made by the hotel for us However I never heard any word from their side in this regard and not even given a nice room There was no view and also the room was too small A simple welcoming letter and nice wish would have made my stay nicer But nothing at all ,No Positive
124409,Hotel Xanadu, The bathroom is weird and very inconvenient Either they forgot to finish the bathroom in Room 201 or the designers decided to trade off guest comfort for a minimalist look in all their bathrooms The bathroom is a smaller than a standard one but I must say a very neat looking one What was strange was that it had absolutely no hooks behind the door or anywhere Neither were there any shelves ledges or towel rods anywhere except for one very short towel rod just behind the WC where 2 extra large fluffy towels were folded several times and squeezed on to this rod This created its own problem but one could live with that So when one was changing or showering there was absolutely no provision for hanging one s clothes or for placing a used towel somewhere for re use One has to either keep it over the toilet seat over the sink or on the floor No exaggerations here Beats me what the management was thinking It was a very big struggle and inconvenience for me As for the shower area the challenge was even worse in the shower cubicle there was not a single shelf or a wall niche to place the soap or shampoo bottle You just have to let all your toiletries share floor space with your feet That s the only way you can have your toiletries with you in the shower I reported it at reception certain it was a lapse during renovation or something like that But I and was very surprised when the very helpful receptionist came back to me after making internal inquiries to tell me that that is how all the bathrooms in Hotel Xanadu were I still think it was an oversight as everything else about the hotel was very good and I really would have liked to make it my preferred hotel in London If not for this inconvemience , Location was superb The hotel s restaurant was very good And the staff were very good too 
124410,Hotel Xanadu, At the surface all looks great but the room wasn t as good as you could expect It was roomy and the bed was comfy but bit worn out , Good location plenty of bars and food options for the dinner 
124411,Hotel Xanadu, The bed is about an inch off the floor which will put you off a bit but is VERY comfortable , Beautiful location near lovely restaurants and cafes Shopping Center 2 minutes away Tube station 5 10 mins walk away 20 30 mins from central London but in a lovely part of Ealing Quite at night with lovely staff would definitely recommend Great value for money Loved the Chinese decor and the book in the room on how to read Chinese Very interesting Was expecting a very small room as norm for London but was pleasantly surprised to find a spacious and vibrant room Will definitely be back again 
124412,Hotel Xanadu, I think there is false advertising, I felt cheated as it said on booking com thAt there was a pool nearby to be used if we are guests at the hotel on reaching there we found out our kids couldn t use it
124413,Hotel Xanadu,No Negative, A contemporary clean hotel with a very comfortable bed and great in room facilities The staff were very helpful and what a great central location Wouldn t hesitate to recommend this hotel
124414,Hotel Xanadu, At night the heating kept switching off automatically and I had to call the reception a couple of times to manually turn it on but still it did not stay working and the room was freezing all night , The hotel is clean and staff are friendly 
124415,Hotel Xanadu, Bed was too soft and uncomfortable matress you rolled to the middle when got in to it Blue tack on the walls and wire sticking out of the heater unit Not really worth the price No smoking area had to sit on the wall at the front of the hotel in the street , Staff were friendly and welcoming Room was clean and good selection of hot drinks and biscuits Nice smellies in the bathroom 
124416,Hotel Xanadu, Rooms don t seem of a 4 standard A double bed was really two singles pushed together of which wasn t comfortable at all , Location is great the interior of the reception and lobby is nice Great shower and hot water 
124417,Hotel Xanadu, Plug sockets next to bed not for a standard 3 pin plug so couldn t use to charge phone IPad Had to use sockets by table in corner away from the bed Some of the hangers in wardrobe wouldn t hold the weight of a coat Worn from wear and tear I informed the lady at reception when checking out and she said she would have them looked at , Bed was good Room a nice size Good sized shower and nicely decorated room Nice restaurant downstairs Book was left in room for guests to read called Chinesey I decided not to buy a copy from reception as suggested on the book cover 
124418,Hotel Xanadu, Staff could have been a little bit more friendly and considerate some of them were very young and unfortunately very stiff strikt and not so welcoming Items provided in the bathroom was largeley insufficient for the price paying no toothbrush toothpaste enough towels products no hair dryer , Good room overall with a nice view over Ealing Very clean and fresh 
124419,Hotel Xanadu, Breakfast for me was perfect but I saw 3 people turned away who arrived before 10 05 Also staff approached people who were eating telling them that breakfast was finishing in minutes so if more food was wanted well , Staff very friendly professional and helpful Hotel had a very calm atmosphere Spotlessly clean and tea coffee etc in room excellent 
124420,Hotel Xanadu,No Negative, Nice clean room with a nice bathroom Very professional staff can deal with problems efficiently Totally recommend it for any physician planning to attend Ealing PACES course 
124421,Hotel Xanadu,No Negative, A comfortable room in a very nice location Quiet but with lots of stores nearby and a metro station in walking distance Polite and friendly stuff and a great breakfast buffet 
124422,Hotel Xanadu, Despite us checking bar closing times and being told last orders was 11 30 we were rushed out of the bar at 10pm We were also told Breakfast was served until 10 30 we went to Breakfast at 10 and there was no food left The waitress informed us that they stop making food before 10 , The room was beautiful modern clean and comfortable
124423,Hotel Xanadu, The only problem with this stay was that the gentlemen on reception when I checked in was extremely rude and I have complained to the hotel manager but have not heard anything yet I stay at this hotel a lot for business but my experience has been not so good this time and it was down to this person ,No Positive
124424,Hotel Xanadu, the double room could have been a bit bigger mini bar not in the room, very comfy beds good breakfast and very helpful staff hotel near the train station and tube
124425,Hotel Xanadu, Needs a good room cleaning Wanted to close bar at 10 said you have to order as we are cashing up Should not have a bar if they can t accomadate, Leaving
124426,Hotel Xanadu, It was surprising for such a modern hotel that was no power point on one side of the bed in order to charge your phone Only one coffee pack in the drawer , Great location in Ealing with many restaurants bars and cafes within a couple of minutes walk Big shopping mall around the corner too 5 minutes walk to the central line underground Rooms were very comfortable with quiet air con and large towels Great breakfast Will definitely stay again 
124427,Hotel Xanadu, Duvet was rather too warm for time of year , Excellent tea and coffee facilities in room D cor was clean and contemporary and very stylish Reception staff were most helpful Location was excellent for transport to London to the airport and the vibrant area around it 
124428,Hotel Xanadu, Nothing, Room was large bright quiet nicely furnished and clean Bathroom was modern and had nice amenities Staff were superb They were warm knowledgeable and efficient Hotel location in Ealing was great with many cafes restaurants and pubs very near Tube and train options at Ealing Broadway are a 5 min walk We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would return 
124429,Hotel Xanadu, Somewhere in the bathroom to hang stuff The evening menu was limited in options and odd portion size , Proper coffee in the room no charge for room service friendly helpful staff Lots of lovely hot water and good shower 
124430,Hotel Xanadu, Just a personal thing but the reception area and restaurant had a slightly gloomy atmosphere Better lighting would solve this perhaps , The cafitiere coffee was a nice touch and the place was generally clean and the staff were friendly and helpful Nice hot shower and the bed was comfy The breakfast choice was excellent 
124431,Hotel Xanadu, Check in time should be more early and check out time should be more late , A mini fridge wid refreshments or just a bottle of water next to the tea and coffee
124432,Hotel Xanadu, The room was small and it was quite expensive for only 2 nights They also tried to charge me for drinks we had when we were checking out which we already paid for and was a big fuffle Wasn t very professional, Everything was fine the room was nice but a little small
124433,Hotel Xanadu, Could ve have a better room service menu but it s located so near to town it doesn t matter too much , Incredibly comfortable beds and a lovely room Very helpful and friendly staff as well 
124434,Hotel Xanadu, Noisy road at 5 am as trash trucks Maybe double glazing needs a look , Bed comfort Crisp white linen Ultra clean View Restaurant Staff Sense of privacy like a quiet retreat
124435,Hotel Xanadu, would have liked bottled water in the room extractor fan in the bathroom didnt seem to be working prefered a fresh fruit salad for breakfast, pillows and bed coffee in the room staff were very attentive
124436,Hotel Xanadu, The bed The lack of information given before arriving ie sign in times and sign out times Also paid extra for breakfadt and i had to argue to get it as it wasnt on their systems, Restuarant deco
124437,Hotel Xanadu, Shower head was attached in a restrictive way and parking was a huge issue Also lack of plug sockets near bedside table , Clean quiet comfortable stay and the location was very good Nice decor too 
124438,Hotel Xanadu, Breakfast was a bit weak There was an initial problem when the fact that we had pre paid for breakfast didn t appear on their system and it took several attempts to sort out When we finally had breakfast there wasn t much We ended up getting a refund and eating out at local restaurants ,No Positive
124439,Hotel Xanadu,No Negative, I stupidly left my iPad in my room when I checked out The hotel rang me straight away and kept my iPad locked in their safe until I returned to collect it Great service and very honest 
124440,Hotel Xanadu, It is indeed convenient to Ealing but a train ride to central London It used to offer tremendous value for money now more variable as I imagine they have more demand for rooms so can charge more We had a problem with the heating in our first room but staff sorted it out the next day , We have stayed at Xanadu three times and come back because we like the atmosphere Staff are always helpful and do their best to help out Rooms are quiet and though the hotel was full we did not hear anyone else We tried the on site restaurant also realy good We will be back 
124441,Hotel Xanadu, Offered breakfast in our room on check in which we took up On check out were then informed this was at a cost of 9 95 per person or 19 90 all together Disappointed in there being no mention of this when the option was offered Paid it begrudgingly as this seemed quite steep considering the going rate in most hotels is 2 3 per person Breakfast wasn t all that either , Lovely personalised service as you would expect for a boutique hotel Good location with close parking Decor cleanliness
124442,Hotel Xanadu, Even though the decoration was very nice it lacked a little of light when using the computer The night staff told us that the hotel could not keep our luggage after checkout which turned out to be a wrong information , The location was perfect for our purpose It was clean and well equipped The staff was generally helpful despite the comment above
124443,Hotel Xanadu, Prices in London are never cheap and it didn t include breakfast which at 20 more never seems value for money, The location was perfect for what we wanted Ealing broadway tube is a few minutes walk
124444,Hotel Xanadu, They tried to tell us we hadn t booked a twin we did it was on the printout I had They sorted it out after a bit of a slightly heated conversation They advised us we should have booked directly with them not though Booking com, Clean good location for the tube bars pubs restaurants etc 
124445,Hotel Xanadu, Booked a twin room but given a double Due to lack of staff it could not be looked into until 11 00pm And then it couldn t be rectified Hotel refused to accept any responsibility due to it being a Booking com reservation , Nice decor facilities and comfort
124446,Hotel Xanadu, Advertised on Booking com that it was less than 5 miles to Wembley stadium which was our sole purpose for the stay In fact it was miles away half an hour in a taxi at 23 per journey to which it cost us just under 70 in taxis to and from Wembley as we were told by the hotel staff that it would be easier to go to Wembley first then get a bus to the hotel we wernt told the bus takes an hour After Wembley there was no chance of a taxi with 84000 people coming out so we had to walk as far as the motorway then wait an hour until a taxi was willing to stop for us ,No Positive
124447,Hotel Xanadu, The room didn t have a mini bar , The location was great An easy trip into central London via Tube or fast train to Paddington Easy trip to Heathrow via train Plentiful restaurants pubs and bars in ealing which is a lovely urban area Rooms are clean comfortable and pleasant and significantly cheaper then Central London Give this place a go you won t regret it 
124448,Hotel Xanadu, nothing, good hotel handy to the tube central to get into London and Heathrow airport good english pub around corner called drappers arms great for meals and beer
124449,Hotel Xanadu, The only thing I noticed when taking a hot shower was that the water went a little cold Intermitantly This only lasted a few seconds and went back to hot water , The location was great and the room was very comfortable
