276817,Novotel Barcelona City, Could have better beds for kids then pull out bed We had only news english speaking channel would have been great just to have one entertainment channel for kids movies, Beautiful modern hotel Great swimming pool on the roof and great view of Barcelona City But drink was a bit expensive and male staff in bar was not helpful waited over 15 mins for drinks Sofa bed was a bit uncomfortable for two kids could have done with a proper beds But great location across from big shopping mall MacDonalds Burger King but avoid Mussol restaurant food very disappointing Taxi approx 15 mins to La Ramblas around 15 euro s for four City bus tour across from hotel 39 per adult and 20 for kids under 10 for two days worth it for two days even to use as transport in and out Hard Rock in Centre fabulous food but book expensive but worth it
276818,Novotel Barcelona City, The breakfast was located in a bunker meeting room during the summer Not cosy at all , Nice beds and silent The kids 10 and 13 years old liked the shoppingcenter that was within a few minutes walk from the hotel I liked the yoga class under the sky roof top 
276819,Novotel Barcelona City, The sofa bed was a bit on the small side , The hotel was very child friendly The pool on the roof was a big plus for the kids and we could relax with a drink whilst the kids had fun 
276820,Novotel Barcelona City, Was a bit far out of the way of the main town always had to get a cab , Breakfast was good a great variety too choose from pool area was nice and great in the evenings with live music 
276821,Novotel Barcelona City, Pool could have been bigger area not used to best it could be A couple of the bar staff were a bit rude and slow at taking any order , Hotel was beautiful and slushes were amazing 
276822,Novotel Barcelona City, None of the staff members were friendly enough Staff refused fo speak any english to help us understand Cleanliness raised questions as there were bed bugs and furniture inside the room such as the rugs which were absolutely filthy The reception staff took it all completely lightly even though a photo was showed and was instantly discarded however serious the complaint was Additionally sink was filthy and not draining , Nothing
276823,Novotel Barcelona City,No Negative, We really loved this hotel The pool and terrace were really fantastic Whilst it is a large busy hotel it really had a chilled atmosphere and the staff were fantastic including Lucile who checked us in I would definitely recommend to all and would return 
276824,Novotel Barcelona City, Bathroom stank a little shower door would not close properly used lots of towels for excess water Not one english speaking movie or tv show channel tv reception poor , Staff very helpful early checkin nice size room good brekky nice pool area 
276825,Novotel Barcelona City, It does not have a good system that they work in took a very long time with different things easily became queues when it was strain felt a bit chaotic sometimes But the staff were nice The restaurant may not hold that high class Our fridge did not work Expensive breakfast 19 , Good staff clean and nice view from the rooftop Very good location walk through the avenue to the beach took 20 min Big shopping mall right across the street Has the potential to be a great good hotel 
276826,Novotel Barcelona City, More toiletries already in the room Would have liked a face cloth included in the towels provided and some black tea and China cups Breakfast was OK but have had a better selection elsewhere for the money charged , Bed is very comfy and room was clean and quite spacious Toiletries provided but abit mean only shampoo soap and shower gel but you could ask at reception for extra like dental kit and comb You also have to wait ages for a lift as hotel is very busy and queue awhile for a table at breakfast 
276827,Novotel Barcelona City, Lifts full all the time and 3 lifts not sufficient Staff seemed unhelpful and not friendly they seemed very busy all the time maybe not enough staff Room was humid and sheets smelt funny a lot of condensation Room key constantly stopped working every other day I had to go to get the keys activated very annoying , coffe was good Hotel was clean well situated and bright Basic gym did the job nice roof top level ambience and feel to it 
276828,Novotel Barcelona City, Pool cold Mildrew in bathroom needs a good clean More variety in gym required , Bed pillows very comortable Good public transport tram buses Metro 
276829,Novotel Barcelona City,No Negative, childrens playground located right before restaurant is very useful to have relaxing breakfast when traveling with kids Hammam and pool at roof are superb city view is pretty cool Shopping mall is across the street R2 Nord train station to airport is 5 min to walk Barcelona Zoo is 5 stops by tram away
276830,Novotel Barcelona City, Parking cost Smell in neighborhood was really awful , Location was very good tram metro right near by shopping mall cafe under musium was very good everyone was very friendly no problems really parking was 18 euros a day not sure if that is good or bad Public transportation was easy wifi eas awesome Great overall stay 
276831,Novotel Barcelona City, We didn t like the key state Our cards never seemed to work and we kept having to get reception to reset them , The views over the city from the roof terrace were great Very relaxed friendly atmosphere with friendly staff 
276832,Novotel Barcelona City, Bed is too small Suppose to be a queen room, Breakfast is ok But not much cater for vegetarians Lot of meat Reception staff are very friendly and helpful Restaurant staff are friendly and helpful Cleaning staff are ok but they don t replace the toiletries and mini bar things properly 
276833,Novotel Barcelona City, Frankly nothing, Everything was perfect staff cleanliness facilities decorate location very excellent location where tram and bus station are only few meters from the hotel and the metro station was 400 meters from it etc Special thanks for George the bellman who was very funny guy I ll miss his laugh The most unique thing was hotel s odor it was fantastic
276834,Novotel Barcelona City, Jacuzzi didn t worked expensive bar at the top of the roof very crowded hotel, I did like the pool at 19 th floor and yoga class at morning with the view
276835,Novotel Barcelona City, Pool area on roof was very windy Very hard to get taxi in evening from outside hotel , Rooms were small but perfect for us beds were very comfortable breakfast was excellent except for the queue to be seated 
276836,Novotel Barcelona City, At some point I was there in my room all alone in the silent and peaceful room when my back started to itch and you know what there was nobody there to scratch it Seriously I couldn t find anything I did not like , the staff the room the views from the 17th floor the facilities pool gym 
276837,Novotel Barcelona City,No Negative, location is perfect and the breakfast is very good Super comfortable extra sofa bed in the room for kids Excellent rooftop pool and kids entertainmnet areas too Great experience
276838,Novotel Barcelona City, Rooms is not suitable for 2 adults and 2 children over 10 Sofa bed is poor for 2 children The glass door on the bathroom makes no sense When kids went to the bathroom at night the whole room was bright Woke everyone The service at the roof bar is very very slow , Nice hotel Rooms clean and modern Breakfast very good Location is great for the city 
276839,Novotel Barcelona City, The room was poor we arrived to find old dirty socks In our room and overall the room was basic and the carpet looked like it needed a good steam clean The location of the hotel for a family isn t great either Although there is a Carrefour and shops nearby for essentials the beach is a good 35 min walk and nothing like our previous stays in Barcelona We wouldn t stay again due to the cleanliness of our room nor the location , The roof top pool is lovely kept nice and clean and perfect for young children with the steps into the pool and the smaller pool too 
276840,Novotel Barcelona City, There were no cups in the room for tea and coffee only paper cups which is not good enough for a four star hotel environmentally unfriendly and burn your hands if you like hot tea Only one small pillow each The choice of tv channels for the kids was poor only Bbc news There was quite a bit of noise from the band upstairs although it ended fairly early The walls were thin and shook whenever a door slammed closed The cooked breakfast was cold and inedible Making a cup of tea at the buffet was difficult as they only had coffee machines and hot water the cold milk wasn t near the tea and coffee had to hunt around for it Novotel hotels are clearly not for me no feeling of value for money for the 213 euro charge per night, The hotel was close to the sagrada familia the pool was ok but cold The views were good room was basic but clean Good customer service staff very helpful Good choice of food at breakfast buffet
276841,Novotel Barcelona City, There is no business centre but the staff did print some documents for me at no charge , The breakfasts were excellent The hotel is convenient for the conference center with a short tram ride Staff were helpful The bed was very comfortable 
276842,Novotel Barcelona City, the pool was freezing so we did not use it which was the main reason for booking this hotel so that was very disappointing , We didnt have breakfast as it was overpriced 
276843,Novotel Barcelona City, The staff and the organization of our rooms was disgusting The rooms were available 2 3 hours after we tried to check in We wasted an hour trying to arrange the check in The receptionist who was dealing with check in was most unhelpful She told us to go grab a drink in the bar by the lobby to which all the staff ignored us and said we needed to go to the roof top bar for a drink We then went back to the reception only to find the previous staff member has disappeared We then had to sort our check in deposits all over again No one apologized about the delay no one was bothered in the slightest We nearly missed our dinner celebrations due to this Luckily the restaurant pushed back our table They also tried to put our rooms on seperate floors when we had 1 group booking , The roof top pool 
276844,Novotel Barcelona City, We should have asked about using the tram but we were able to get a taxi to the city centre Possibly with a tram bus we could have done more sightseeing We were exhausted after a long flight so most probably we did not do enough homework , We were lucky to have booked when we did as we got a bargain Really value for money thank you booking com This was perfect for our stay in Barcelona 
276845,Novotel Barcelona City, I booked the room through Booking com however when we arrived at the property the receptionist told us that there is no spare bed for my 10 yrs old child and were told that the hotel doesn t take responsibility The guy said that the hotel wouldn t take responsibility for an error made by Booking com ,No Positive
276846,Novotel Barcelona City, There was absolutely nothing that we didn t like , Great hotel in good location next to the landmark Torre Gl ries and with the Gl ries shopping mall just across the road Buses trams and Metro just a short walk and always an abundance of taxis which we found very reasonable particularly as there were four of us to share the fare Great panoramic view of the city from our tenth floor room 1017 although our friends in room opposite didn t have that Superb rooftop terrace 
276847,Novotel Barcelona City,No Negative, No prior announcement of temp power shutdown which caused panic on 12th morning ard 2am for which i d lodged a separate complaint directed to Accor team At the time we had just returned very late from city and my wife was taking shower when suddenly it shut down We came down to receptionist along with other guests however unpleasant feedback from receptionist 
276848,Novotel Barcelona City, The pull out bed was not the best and was lumpy and uncomfortable , Good Hotel in a good location Situated beside a good shopping centre and close to public transport and tourist busses The rooms are clean and tidy a little bit small but it is the city centre so as expected The shower was great somehow didn t manage to steam up the mirror 
276849,Novotel Barcelona City, Complications on payments due to hotel taking a charge on my credit card due to arrival after 6pm and we wanted to pay cash for entire stay Eventually resolved but only after involving a number of staff Senior staff all friendly but one or two more junior staff on reception quite sullen Left short of towels and toiletries on two occasions and would wonder as to extent of daily cleaning as a number of used items left behind after cleaning Pool area on roof impressive but pools not heated and freezing Note that given the number of people in the hotel the area is quite small and will get crowded easily Also noted plastic bottles and debris floating in it but it was not being used at that time Minibar prices very very expensive There are three lifts for the nineteen floor hotel so they quite quite busy at peak times I was left waiting for up to 10 minutes a couple of times as people headed for breakfast or checkout , Ideal location and good sized rooms for 2 2 family Lovely bathroom and no noise at night Breakfast had good variety but hot food was usually quite cold Children loved the Kinect and the interactive gaming table in reception but children s designated play area tiny and maybe more for toddlers 
276850,Novotel Barcelona City,No Negative, The daily breakfast was fantastic I ve paid for breakfasts at the hotel in other european cities and they don t come close to the quality and variety of Novotel s

276854,Novotel Barcelona City, I was happy with everything especially pool and roof top terrace , The staff in hotel especially Lucille was so fantastic and helpful We got bad news from home near end of our holiday and they made her feel very comfortable
276855,Novotel Barcelona City, the children bed sofa that was changed was VERY BAD Staff should try to sleep in it very hard and uncomfortable you feel the spirals under your skin We changed every night so every one of our 4 could have also a good night in the parents bed That s important to change , breakfast staff neighborhood of metro station
276856,Novotel Barcelona City, Breakfast selection is extensive BUT if you do not eat Pork your choices are limited for hot breakfast Only non pork options are Spanish omelette tomatoes topped with breadcrumbs and fried eggs No meat free sausages no hash browns no mushrooms no beans There are however a selection of croissants breads etc Staff were okay some more helpful than others but I guess that s life Only ate at the restaurant once menu was a bit limited and when I ordered croquettes on the menu they came covered in Pancetta I had to ask for the waitress to take them back explaining I do not eat pork My main was fish and that too came sandwiched with Pancetta Again I sent it back I checked the menu and it does not stipulate that both dishes come with pork and I raised that with the waitress My main was prepared again but the chef did not appear pleased which made me uncomfortable The waitress however was apologetic , The hotel is in a handy location with shops and takeaway restaurants nearby Tram system is pretty easy to use too Rooms were nice we stayed in a family room which had a double bed and sofa bed that was fine Only the room itself was not very spacious Little room to manoeuvre Rooftop pool and terrace was beautiful 
276857,Novotel Barcelona City, The hotel was trying too hard to be fashionable and trendy They need to be more flexible in a lot of areas checking in meal times etc etc Food in the restaurant was poor Poor menu and all pre packed re heated food , Good location with excellent views from the roof pool bar Good clean rooms
276858,Novotel Barcelona City, The price could be lower but Barcelona is an expensive city anyway , Phantastic view from the top floors and the pool bar Comfortable bed with smartpillows 
276859,Novotel Barcelona City, The hot food at breakfast needs to be hotter and hotel bar prices are very high , The bed was comfortable and in a very accecable area to reach many parts of the city 
276860,Novotel Barcelona City, We booked a family room but the sofa bed for the kids was not too comfortable and a little on the small side , The staff were always friendly and helpful Breakfast was varied and great for the kids Excellent location to get around the city while also having some good places nearby 
276861,Novotel Barcelona City, Bed was very hard It was difficult to keep the entire bathroom from getting wet when showering Prices in bar and restaurant were a little high for what you were getting , Nice and clean great lobby and bar area nice fitness center helpful staff It felt very safe good security measures and in a nice location 
276862,Novotel Barcelona City, 1 They gave us a room for the disabled 2 We were asked to pay 200 euro deposit after we paid for the room 3 Cosmetics were not replaced after use 4 No bathrobes and slippers in the room 5 Beef and lamb from the restaurant was not edible and coffee in the Lobby was not as specified Nesspreso coffee tasteless 6 In the second day was ruined TV 7 BATHROOMS NEEDS RENOVATION 8 OLD TV , ONLY the clean and quiet room 
276863,Novotel Barcelona City, Not sure if its a spanish thing but the eggs in the morning were practical raw , Nice size breakfast area selection requested a room with a view which they honoured in the 18th floor Lovely directly across the rd from a variety of shops a 5min walk to the metro 
276864,Novotel Barcelona City, More English speaking channels I could not anything else , Clean and spacious rooms with comfortable bed Great and delicious breakfast with enough of choice for everyone This hotel is serving you the best quality for a fear price I recommend this hotel for families with young childrens 
276865,Novotel Barcelona City, Location was not in city centre Bars of the hotel was not opened and if opened than there was no staff to serve and in one instance scurity personal has to call the resturant to bring staff to attend coustomers Its like cost cutting of less people to cover both resturant and bars , Staff was very helpful Room was comfortable and bathroom was very clean Lobby was good place to sit and relax 
276866,Novotel Barcelona City, That we didnt stay longer , Great location especially with a family Rooms are very comfortable very clean and had a lovely rain shower Fantastic new shopping mall across the road from hotel with a supermarket ideal if you forgot something on a trip Metro stop right beside hotel with red line bringing you to all the Tourist Hot Spots Just up from hotel the Red Bus Tour has a stop and a ticket office Super Fantastic Roof Top Bar and pool with panoramic views of the city and the kids were most welcome The staff were very pleasant and location felt very safe and secure Nice walk if you are up to it to the beach bring the runners Overall a great hotel for a good City Break 
276867,Novotel Barcelona City, It was only a family room because of the sofa bed There was a door that could have made it a connecting room with the adjacent room That would be a better option with older kids The door also made it too easy to hear everything in the next room The pullout sofa was just big enough for 2 small kids and would be pretty uncomfortable for an adult due to the thin mattress and springs , Overall this was a great hotel fantastic value and we would definitely stay here again but if you really want a family room book adjoining rooms We visited Barcelona right before Christmas with our 3 and 6 year olds We stayed in a family room 1411 which seemed like a normal double room with a smallish pullout sofa The main bed was very comfortable and the blackout shades kept the room dark Breakfast was good with scrambled eggs fritatas sausage bacon pastries cereal yogurt fruit meats and cheese but the same everyday VERY few hotels we looked at in Barcelona had breakfast included so this was a big bonus It is located about 5 6 minutes walk from a metro that takes you straight downtown Buy a 10 trip card for 10 Euro rather than pay 2 40 per trip There is a mall across the street with a big grocery store and some standard shops like Zara and H M but nothing special There looked like a couple fast food places but little else for food in the area Taxis were fairly cheap and there were always 2 or 3 right outside it was about 8 Euro to Sagrada Familia and 35 Euro to the airport We looked at a lot of hotels in the downtown area but all seemed risky for either quality or noise in this price range This was modern clean comfortable and convenient all at a great price 
276868,Novotel Barcelona City, The staff let us feel that we aren t welcomed in the hotel because we were a family with 3 small kids They wanted us to leave the hotel because they can t accept 3kids in the suite,No Positive

276870,Novotel Barcelona City, check in took too long the receptionist did not report the basic information about the hotel The receptionist gave us a card to the room where they slept guests at 02 00 am Elevator system often fell out we had to repeatedly reset room card 3x per day , Great breakfast selection The location was perfect shops and restaurants across the street and the train station is just around the corner Beautiful views of the city on terrace

276905,Novotel Barcelona City, The hotel was fine overall but I did not appreciate that the price which I was quoted and which had been debited from my credit card upon booking the room on Booking com was actually in the end higher than quoted So on departure I was charged an extra 20 euros per night without any clear explanation despite querying it I don t think that it is good practice for hoteliers to charge more that what was initially quoted and debited for no real explanation I would not recommend or book this hotel again for that reason and I would like someone to explain to me why this happened on that occasion ,No Positive
