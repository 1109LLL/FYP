44050,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Friday morning hot breakfast items weren t vey hot but better on Saturday morning Wardrobe not long enough to hang iron dress as shelf in way single room number 510 TV at difficult angle to watch in bed Waiting staff brushing table crumbs on to floor from tables that often came my way But I m being picky , I often use hotel and standard consistent Small amounts of breakfast foods displayed means replenished often Comfy bed Iron in room and no problem getting ironing board from room service staff
44051,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Wifi didn t work half the time TV connection kept dropping all the time Only discovered by chance we could order a la carte breakfast options on the morning we left V disappointed we didn t know as most food from the buffet was barely warm Overall not impressed at all , Location
44052,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Room was quite small with limited storage space, Location great for public transport and lots of eating places We had a quiet room and the staff were helpful 
44053,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Double room extremely small Shower would benefit a proper shower base to avoid floor becoming very wet and slippery Not enough towels provided for 2 people , Hotel is ideally located for tourist attractions
44054,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Somtimes I had to ask for a bathroom item that the staff forget to replace soap towels etc , Everything was perfect great location room bed bathroom staff etc 
44055,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, There was a problem getting the WiFi to connect which went on for about a day of our 5 day stay but the staff were very helpful and did finally get someone to sort it out for which we were grateful , Location for the British Musesm and tube perfect Air conditioning worked well and staff quick to come and help us work out how to adjust it London was hot 
44056,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, I was there with my mother we had a twin room and the beds were a bit too soft for our back , The staff is very friendly and helpful hotel is clean not too big which makes it very cosy elegant and just perfect for the purpose of my trip I also hear the same comments of other guest that i talked to at the lift 
44057,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Staff did not seem to have knowledge of local area were not helpful in dealing with questions seemed a little unprofessional Compared to staff at other hotels I ve stayed at I found this disappointing Breakfast not included , Great location
44058,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The room was very small and the bathroom was tiny very little room to move The sink and faucet were structured extremely uncomfortable almost no room to wash hands under it , The breakfast was great and it is pretty close to a tube station 
44059,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Room key card failed 3 times Hair dryer kept breaking asked reception if they could get a new one as we were ready to go out for dinner It took 20 mins and man only came to fix it rather than bring another one We managed without , location
44060,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Restaurant service was a little slow , Staff were very friendly when we booked in room was clean and tidy comfy bed and nice shower Excellent location 
44061,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, It would have been nice to have a view but can t always expect that in a city hotel , The location was ideal for getting to Theatre and shopping Also great that we were able to walk to most places if we wanted Lovely breakfast comfy beds and very helpful staff 
44062,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, We went to breakfast at a busy time one morning Not all the staff were up to the mark I would suggest management employ a mystery guest to easily identify the workers and the slackers , The room was quiet and comfortable 
44063,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Staff on check in could have been more friendly though staff in the restaurant and reception during out stay were very good and helpful , Restaurant was excellent and catered for my special dietary requirements
44064,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The price of the food and drink although more affordable good eating and drinking places are available locally We expected single beds but were given a small double in a very small room Also the air conditioning was very noisy We had requested a walk in shower unit but had to make do with a shower over a bath Not ideal for older people , The staff were friendly and helpful The location was ideal for the purpose of our visit i e an extended visit to the University College Hospital London located close to Queens Square 
44065,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Breakfast was really bad Literally no fresh ham and cheese and not really cold just a few pieces of bread coffee wasn t good and if you get there half an hour before end you just get the last pieces of nearly nothing We got a bathroom for handicapped so everything was very uncomfortable for us , Checkin was fast and the beds were super comfortable People were very friendly You get fast everywhere 
44066,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The fabrics of the carpet some of the furniture look quite worn out It does need better maintenance I saw the built in lamp in the bathroom needed major repair worked but it was obvious water had leaked through there room 305 The breakfast used to be a bit better the first times I went to this hotel , really nice and helpful staff great location if you are arriving into London with little luggage at Kings Cross you can walk for 20 min to get to the property Close to the British museum and in a nice area Rooms are relatively clean and not super small like other London hotel rooms 
44067,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Wonderful location friendly and helpful staff nice rooms with excellent bathroom facilities quiet for so central a location Great pubs just around the corner cafes restaurants and Russell Square garden on the doorstep 
44068,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Bathroom was tiny Toilet was against the wall on one side and very close to vanity on opposite side A larger person would not be able to use comfortably , Bed was super comfy
44069,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Booking was not recognised when I arrived They had no record of my booking so room was not ready The member of staff on reception was not very warm or welcoming and I agreed to return later as she would look at getting a room ready , Nespresso machine in the room Lovely smell as you entered the lobby Location ideal for kings cross and British museum 
44070,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Paying for breakfast but was offered it cheaper when we checked in , Excellent location for central London shower was excellent the air con was also very good
44071,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The fire alarm at 00 15 was activated by persons unknown however full credit to the staff who put our mind at rest as it was a false alarm , The accommodation was very close to the hospital we had to attend everything was of a very high standard considering the traffic noise from the street below with the windows closed and the a c on we had no problems sleeping Except at approx 00 15 the fire alarms went off see below 
44072,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The staff were very rude phoned up after a family bereavement to try and change the booking date No sympathy at all just cut me off mid sentence and refused Passed the room on to friends instead and they weren t that impressed Very average , Very good location
44073,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, I had difficulty working the shower but this was quickly dealt with, Excellent breakfast buffet with plenty of choice Self service coffee a nice touch Waiting staff attentive without being intrusive
44074,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The bathroom was very small and not particularly functional the make up mirror was welcome but too far away to reach the tap in the sink was awkward and the toilet was right next to a wall , The manager Christophe was super nice snd professional we requested a corkscrew and he brought it himself even pouring the wine with a flourish The hotel is in a great location close to the British Museum and other sites as well as restaurants etc 
44075,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, It was not clear that the room was a single room for 2 people when we booked it so we had to share a 3 quarter bed , The hotel is quiet which is ideal for a stay in London that can be quite noisy
44076,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, We booked a small room that was very affordable It was a little tight for us and we would upgrade our room choice next time One should know however that we have stayed at the Plaza and other hotels in NYC and elsewhere and their accommodations were even smaller for two and three times the price , Pleasantly the hotel was within walking distance of nearly everything that we wanted museums theater restaurants It was priced affordably and was well maintained All staff were clearly exceptional We travel a lot and have seen nearly everything This one was superior when it comes to staff Breakfast was very good and wait staff were among the best We WILL stay here again 
44077,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The room was a little small, The position was convenient to where we were going Staff were helpful and friendly The room was well equipped clean and comfortable 
44078,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Nothing to complain about , Large room and very contemporary Facilities very clean and bed comfortable Staff very helpful and friendly Would definately stay again 
44079,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Above the general London Hotel Standard The bed in the Small Double Room was a little bit too small for our taste Would choose normal sized Double Room next time 
44080,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Didnt like the way the wifi kept logging you out Room was advertised as small and indeed it was Noise from alleyway was quite loud according to my husband personally I wont travel without earplugs they also provided free earplugs as a plus though , Location was good breakfast was good Wifi was ok
44081,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The Marco Pierre white restaurant we could buy a bottle of wine but NOT a glass And they had run out of the cheaper wines We were then challenged for asking to have the service charge removed as we wanted to tip waitress Disgusting service ,No Positive
44082,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Cleaning lady rushing into the room when i arrived to add a bottle of water When i asked why she was rushing in she could not answer as she did not speak english and did not understand me Room was too hot during the night a lot of noise from outside and the corridor I did not have a good sleep at all Bed not comfortable Room 309 was not at a higher level as requested Carpet on the Floor was a disadvantage for my allergies Cleaning lady knocked on my door at 8 15 am again without any explanation , Nice welcoming staff
44083,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Room was extremely small considering it was meant to be a double Half of the TV channels did not receive a signal Walls are quite thin, Location is well connected
44084,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Only problem was keycard for room had to get reset 4 times in our 2 day stay which was annoying having to go back down to reception to get reset, Very friendly staff always willing to help good breakfast on a morning room service if required 
44085,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The room was a little too warm so had to open windows at night and due to location it was a bit noisy outside due to traffic We dislike using air conditioning for health reasons , spacious room very clean well decorated and comfortable bed Very good breakfast Staff were professional and helpful 
44086,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The room was too warm but okay once the AC kicked in It could be noisy as the room we had was close to two others , We did t eat breakfast in the hotel The location was good for theatres and shopping 
44087,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, we had some concerns about the cleanness of the place when we saw a mouse passing through in the breakfast lounge in the morning while having breakfast not sure i will re book again on it, the room was good size it seems clean
44088,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The lights in the bathroom are controlled by motion detectors but don t detect movement if you re in the shower so you keep getting plunged into darkness and have to wave your arms out of the shower to get the lights back on it s totally rubbish ,No Positive
44089,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The bar was part of marcos restaurant and did not feel like a hotel bar Felt rushed at breakfast as they were doing renovations was given a disabled room which we did not require the room was ok but sink very low and the bathroom was a wet room, Lovely comfy beds and great location
44090,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, the extra charges while changing a room should not apply to a customer for instance we had a one day booking and then 4 days we requested to remian us in the same room as of first day and for this extra charges were asked , The hotel location as the most
44091,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Didn t realize about your restaurant which was unfortunate as we were down to surprise my grandson on his 21st and could have had it in the hotel which would have been fabulous , It was very nice and comfortable will recommend you to friends 
44092,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Room was a bit smaller than I thought but was perfectly adequate Missed having a set of drawers in the room to put clothes items in Also main dislike was that the windows both had obscured glass in so you couldn t see out at all However no e of these things affected our overall stay which we enjoyed a lot and would definitely stay again , The hotel is easy to find with very friendly helpful staff Very central to get everywhere and walkable to Euston station Didn t try the food but restaurant attached looked very nice Bed was very comfortable and very clean and the room was quiet with no road noise 
44093,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Bedroom a little small for twin beds , Comfortable bed and the breakfast was excellent considering it was included in the hotel booking Good location if going to the theatre approximately a 15 minute walk and Euston station was approximately 10 minutes from the hotel walking 
44094,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Although we booked a small double we did not expect it and the bathroom to be quite so small , Staff were very friendly helpful and charming at all times
44095,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The lift is incredibly slow and the lobby hotel is cluttered and a bit crappy for a mercure Not impressed they let down the chain I was given a room with a tiny frosted window they could have given me a nicer room but didn t I had to go down and complain before they thought of that ,No Positive
44096,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The breakfast really let it down We were not advised we could order toast until we saw others doing it The cooked breakfast was not being topped up My husband asked if they could bring out some baked beans as they had run out and he got told no Once it s gone its gone There was still 30 mins left for breakfast so thought this was a little unfair If we had known it was first come first served then we would have arrived earlier , The location was fantastic The hotel was very clean quiet the reception staff were extremely accommodating 
44097,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Everything was great , It was a perfect location for our weekend and the bed was super comfy especially after a night out We didn t have to take any public transport as it s about 14 mins walk to Oxford Street for a shopping spree and similar distance to get to Covent Garden for some interesting restaurants and bars The staff wrote a special note with birthday wishes for my partner which was a great 
44098,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The bed isn t comfortable at all and the bathroom is very tiny I can barely fit in it There was a lady in the restaurant her name is Alexandra she was rude and obnoxious, The whole staff was amazing to us they were very helpful and professional I can t say enough about Raffiela She was a very nice and patient 
44099,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The room was very small my request before booking was not even acknowledged The air con unit was broken which made it an uncomfortable temperature at night The bed was a little bit bigger then a single which for a couple made sleeping very difficult Wifi kept disconnecting with low connectivity message continually popping up Lastly I was charged 75 for damage to an iron and throw I did not use the iron and not to sure how the throw got damaged from sitting on it They have sent me pictures of the damage which is irrelevant as it was not caused by my stay The lady who I spoke to regarding the charge said that they have several people who check the room before the guest stay to ensure all is in good working order I mentioned to her if this is the case why was the air con not working the On button was clearly broken and can visually see it Her response wa did you report it Her answer contradicts the several services checks they apparently do before a room is occupied by the guest I am currently waiting on a response from Mr Greg Black the General Manager which I should receive on 10 4 17 in regards to refunding me the 75 which I have been charged for damage which has not been caused by my stay , The bathroom and room was clean
44100,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Wifi is HOPELESS Not good enough So difficult to connect anywhere in building and get disconnected easily Bandwidth poor If you say you offer free wifi you need to do better, Very warm and friendly staff Convenient location and decent price
44101,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, There s really nothing not to like For Central London this is great value and a lovely hotel , Staff are always lovely Robert and Manuela in the restaurant and at breakfast always do a great job Rooms very clean and comfortable 
44102,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Only moan would be room was SO hot despite opening a window bit too uncomfortable for sleeping in but that is a very minor problem in a very nice stay , Great location very friendly and helpful staff comfy room nice and clean 
44103,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The noise is too loud on the front there is traffic which is very present on the back the air conditioning is not much better also noticeably loud Didn t sleep very well despite earplugs , Hotel is fine nice beds staff tries hard to satisfy your needs That is very good 
44104,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Only one little thing having a front window could hear every little noise outside cars people walking past etc but to be expected being in such a central location , Great location super comfy bed and the little extras with the hot chocolates and biscuit lovely friendly staff will definitely use this hotel again 
44105,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Bar staff Failled to tell us that last orders was due Smuggly Insisted that we ordered room service in our room This was bang on the hour Cost twice the price , Front of house staff
44106,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Rooms are a bit small and the pillows are not very soft , The staff was friendly and the reservation management were excellent on accommodation my request for an early checkin The hotel is very well located and maintained The room amenities are good 
44107,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Bed was too small for 2 people Shower tub was quite narrow as well Wifi dropped often and session length is configured to 5 hours which means if you sleep for 8 hours your phone will be checking email etc using data from your phone provider for the last 3 hours , Staff was very nice and helpful Property was clean The location was convenient lots of restaurants and shops nearby the British Museum 2 blocks away and the Russel Square and Holborn tube stops each about a 5 minute walk Electrical outlets were plentiful 
44108,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The breakfast was awful Smoked streaky bacon has no place on an English breakfast it is an American preference The hash browns were bland and no flavour whatsoever the sausages were very over cooked and tasted awful the eggs were hard the beans were solidified I couldn t eat my breakfast it was that awful so i gave it to one of the staff in the dining room so I could make room on the table for something else The waitress looked at me with daggers for not eating the meal she didn t ask me why or if there was any problem with it and try and help me she just scowled at me and took the plate to the kitchen For namesake the waitress name was Alexandra I then had fruit and toast and the fruit was going brown in the bowl and mainly consisted of apple and little else My added cost for breakfast left a very bitter taste in my mouth, The room was very good and was clean and comfortable The staff at reception were very helpful too 
44109,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Perfectly situated within walking distance of Theatre District Restaurants and very close to Holborn Underground Station A very nice Boutique hotel not too big and suited us perfectly We had a nice quiet room too and it had everything we needed 
44110,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Booked for superior room but would question if 708 was, Super king size and very comfortable bed Staff extremely helpful and friendly Hotel is well located and i would recommend 
44111,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, No improvement required , Stayed in room 009 piece and quiet despite being in the middle of the city Modern decoration and very clean Excellent restaurant and great breakfast all within easy walking distance of theatres and underground 
44112,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The room was noisy which was due to traffic from the busy main road We know that this couldn t be helped and when in London there is more traffic than elsewhere The hotel provided ear plugs to overcome this However after a busy day and due to a comfortable bed and room the noise became a distant memory , The hotel room facilities breakfast were all fantastic 
44113,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Wi Fi cost me data as it kept dropping off In fact it was easier to pick up the Belford , Bed lovely and comfy room perfect temp nice lighting great location
44114,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The bedroom and bathroom were very small however that was not a problem We were wakened about 6 00 am both mornings with the noise of a water tank or such like filling up There was no public bar or mini bar in the bedroom , The hotel was in an excellent location 12 minute walk from Euston Station and an easy walk to Covent Garden 
44115,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, We had an extractor fan outside of the room which meant it was loud if you opened the window however this wasn t a huge problem by any means The breakfast was quite expensive which put us off including this in our booking There are plenty of cafes and take away refreshment areas close to the hotel so this wasn t an issue , We stayed in a small double room after reading some reviews I was a bit hesitant as they seemed to think it was too small however I found it a good size and not too small at all The room was really comfortable the bed was great The inclusion of a mini fridge in the room meant that we could bring back chilled refreshments which is a great addition for big tea drinkers like we were The bathroom facilities are also a really good size The hotel overall is very modern very clean and efficient and the staff very accommodating Check in was quick and simple as was check out The hotel was nice and quiet we barely saw or heard other guests The location is excellent close to Euston station and within walking distance of the West End and Covent Garden 
44116,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, How accommodating the staff were to last minute changes and requests to our booking based on our needs They really made our stay comfortable and welcoming 
44117,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Nothing , This is our 2nd visit to the hotel It is quiet and provides excellent access to surrounding theatres Will definitely use again Staff really helpful 
44118,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, We booked 2 standard double rooms 1 was half the size of the other with the tiniest shower room ever The other room was much larger with a bath and room to swing a cat Checked with reception to see if we had been allocated correctly and was told it was a standard because it has a queen size bed This maybe the case but you could hardly walk round the end of the bed and would have said it was more one of their cosy doubles I dread to think how small a cosy double would be Very noisey from extractors and the aircon was as loud but you do get ear plugs , Excellent breakfast but wouldnt pay 16 95 for it
44119,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Room was a bit small but that s London for you , Staff location and cleanliness Like to thank the barman who gave us a free glass of Prosecco when he asked how was our evening and I replied mixed feelings as anniversary but Grandad had just died He then returned with the glass and said it was to commemorate Grandad and celebrate our anniversary It was a nice touch and appreciated 
44120,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, There was nothing not to like , The bed very comfy the room comfortable and stylish The staff very friendly and efficient The breakfast delicious a wonderful selection of great quality 
44121,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, breakfast a bit on the expensive side even for London , Ideal location for central London very close to Russell Square underground station Hotel staff all lovely rooms clean and comfortable On site Marco Pierre White restaurant Didn t have breakfast as we felt 16 95 each was very expensive and decided to find somewhere cheaper to eat Hotel close to lots of lovely bars and restaurants Would definitely use Hotel again 
44122,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and it was a very pleasant stay in a lovely hotel Location was very good for what we wanted to do in London I would definitely stay again 
44123,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, 30 pound early checkin like really That s the first thing you say to someone after a 14hr flight at 8am I m okay with it if the room isn t ready but it s ready and you just charge me to access it small old and cold rooms Staff generally not very pleasant couldn t really be bothered to greet me in the morning or evening , Well close enough to my office Guess location wise it s good 
44124,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, This is the second time we book at this hotel last time been probably 8 years ago We didn t have breakfast here as there were a lot better options for the price The double standard room had a very small bed I didn t remember them being that small before However they did let us choose a different room for an extra cost , They had a good taxi arranging service also a printout service for out winter wonderland tickets That was very fast actually it didn t take us any time to book from mobile and get the ticket in an envelope 
44125,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, OK it sounds like a list of stupid things but they added up to a poor experience The room was VERY small we had asked for a superior room with the larger bed this is basically a small room with a large bed in it so the floor space was minimal At the back of the hotel so quiet but VERY cold It was a cold night and the heating had been put on the lowest setting Even when we turned the heating up the general warmth was pretty poor and we did not warm up at all This was not helped by the two windows in the room having poorly fitted and broken frames although they were double glazed there was a chill wind coming through the sides The heated towel rail did not work in the bathroom so the bathroom was also freezing We were told in reception the following morning that this was deliberate but not why The bed was very uncomfortable not because it was too firm but because it was way too soft like sleeping on a piece of foam with massive give We both woke up having had a very bad nights sleep being freezing cold and could not wait to escape Two teabags only so our morning cuppa was a bit limited We skipped breakfast as we felt that 16 95 each was a bit steep even in London We had room service which was good and the food was also good But generally we were cold and uncomfortable and had a very poor experience Sorry Mercure but it was not a good stay at all , The location was excellent and perfect for our plans
44126,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Hotel bed very soft a little sink if you sleep for a long time so you feel a bit uncomfortable And especially in the morning it happened to me during the week the elevator stops on every floor on the way down it s a little disturbing if you are on the top floor of the hotel , Great hotel very comfortable accessible anywhere in the city there is a bus stop outside the hotel and a train station within walking distance of 3 minutes Clean rooms very excellent staff Free WIFI The hotel is very close to Oxford Street 
44127,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The room was was very noisy with massive air conditioning works outside the window but the air con inside the room didn t work so stiflingly hot inside the room If windows were opened the machinery outside was too noisy to be able to sleep so a bit like a cell The Christmas Day lunch was very disappointing Marco s restaurant in the hotel , Staff generally helpful Went out to get me another Times newspaper after the cleaners had thrown out the one just purchased for the Xmas period 
44128,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Perfect central location for where I needed to be for both my business and social needs The decor lighting and ambience were lovely modern fresh but also cosy homely I was only staying for the one night so my priority was a good comfortable bed quality power shower My room provided both 
44129,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Quite noisy being by the road but I feel this would be the case of most hotels in the middle of London , Great location for a London mini break Really helpful and friendly staff I accidentally left a couple of items in the room and I was contacted quickly they couldn t have been more helpful and efficient sending my items back to me 
44130,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Nothing really, Helpful and extremely polite staff spacious and clean room 706 comfortable bed good location close to Holborn metro station rich breakfast 
44131,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Nothing I did not like Only reason for facilities answer is because of the space constraints at that location the bed had to be hard up against a wall , The staff were excellent especially at breakfast
44132,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Nothing apart from too few tea bags coffee sachets and milk a minor criticism , Location Tea making facilities but there could have been more milk and tea coffee 
44133,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, The bar is right next to restaurant which made things awkward being a large group to socialise in bar Had to move to pub round the corner, All staff were great lovely friendly hotel Hotel in good location
44134,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Nothing really, Friendly reception staff found me the best coffee shop in Bloomsbury Modern bathroom had under floor heating a welcome touch in winter Brasserie attached 
44135,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Small room even though we had superior king dread to think what the size of the standard rooms were like too hot could not turn down temperature rusty radiator dirty windowsill considering the price and classed as 4star breakfast very limited and not even fresh pot of brewed pot of coffee or tea just given a mug to fill yourself at machine, Pleasant waiter in evening
44136,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Not what it was a repeat visitor there has been a revamp but not for the good Manuela and Valentino always looked after me no where to be seen More impersonal than it was Restaurant nothing wrong with the old one and the food was better ,No Positive
44137,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Didn t affect us but the coffee machine at breakfast Buffett needs to be moved away from food, Location suited our needs a very friendly comfortable place to stay
44138,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Closet is on the small size and there s no coat hooks for wet coats I know we can use the shower but once one of us wanted to take a shower to warm up Overall you do a GREAT job thank you , Location is superb easy Tube ride from Heatlhrow British Museum practically around the corner Staff are wonderfully helpful Nice toiletries Comfy compact room Bus stop into Trafalgar Square in front of hotel 10 mins Good restaurant on site GREAT shower some Americans never get used to London plumbing We would come back 
44139,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Memo to self Read the details carefully A small double means a small double bed not a small double room The bed was tiny My other half and I are both six foot so this was something of a squeeze Sadly no other rooms were available It was clearly stated on the site when i booked i just didn t read it properly Oh dear My bad But a terrible nights sleep ensued and not the grand chambre I was hoping for , The staff were the highlight of this stay Friendly to a fault Couldn t help enough all wonderfully European and so kind The breakfast was pretty super too 
44140,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Parking could have been directed to best parking in description was under a competing Hotel opposite side of the road Not knowing this used more expensive park further away , Very good price for the location easy walk to West End Covent Garden Leicester Sq etc Staff friendly and helpful Room what you would expect for city hotel 
44141,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, One small problem was that the bedroom was a little chilly and we could not get the radiator to work However the customer service team very quickly provided a fan heater which remedied the situation , This is a very comfortable hotel in an excellent location close to the West End It is a relatively small hotel with excellent staff which gives it an intimate friendly atmosphere Rooms are very comfortable and well appointed Breakfast was excellent 
44142,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Breakfast not included no good beer on tap in bar paint work around window in bathroom a bit shabby lots of sirens in the night , Great staff super freindly and polite Walking distance to what I wanted to do Close to tube Great breakfast 
44143,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, I don t have anything here , Location great Room decent size bed comfortable modern fresh decor Staff the whole team really work well together good culture between them means good focus in the client Front of house and concierge above standard expected 
44144,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Great location just a few minutes walk from two tube stations and coffee shops etc on the doorstep Room at the back of the hotel was very quiet with little disturbance from other guests Beds were comfy and had a great night sleep Staff were friendly and helpful
44145,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Rooms very small and cramped Staff were unaccommodating Our son got food poisoning and was sick so at 1am we rang the front desk to ask if the hotel had any over the counter medicine available for an upset stomach They didn t have any so the receptionist was politely asked if it was possible for a sprite or a coke to be delivered to the room First the receptionist stated that I would have to come downstairs myself to get the soda because if they brought it to the room it would cost pds5 extra so the cost for the small soda would be pds 8 50 I was not bothered by cost at that point so asked if the soda could be delivered anyway Two minutes later the receptionist phones back to say the soda couldn t be delivered to the room as I had not opened an account with the hotel for ancillary expenses This was deplorable customer service As a business traveller I visit London often and will never stay at this hotel again I do not recommend this hotel to any other traveller There are much better options available in the area , Nice lobby
44146,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, AC was not working properly in our room Clearly the size of the AC was not strong enough for the size room layout WIFI was like as good as non existent Kept losing connection in less than a minute Staff were trying to be helpful but could not do much , Rooms were clean and decent size for London standards Hotel lobby small but decent looking and clean 
44147,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel,No Negative, Of the seven hotels in England I stayed at this was the only one with air conditioning Glad I wasn t going in early August Everything else was quite adequate since I was not expecting luxury accommodations

44262,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Only downside was we went for a drink at the bar having got back late from the theatre and it was closed even though in house literature stated it was open until 12 30am , Fantastic location The hotel was very clean and the room while not the biggest were nicely decorated and clean We didn t eat there as thought breakfast price high so can t comment but there are lots of places to get breakfast close by

44269,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Checking out was not pleasant as the receptionist was patronising and rude when explaining that the bill was to be paid at check out I was unaware that it was not already completed when I booked online But her explanation and entire demeanour could have done with a lot of improvement , Hotel was lovely in a central location The power shower was well appreciated as well 
44270,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Unfortunately my first night was overbooked requiring me to be transported to another hotel in the Waterloo area Only a big inconvenience because this occurred after a long day of travel and arriving close to 1am at this hotel , The staff was very helpful and the hotel was in an excellent location near tube stations the British museum and many great restaurants

44280,Mercure London Bloomsbury Hotel, Due to my unexpected sickness I needed to shorten my UK trip When I checked in I asked the night shift female receptionist if there would be any flexibility and possibility to cancel or refund partial hotel booking fee Of course I fully understood of the terms and conditions Regrettably she rejected immediately and spoke to me loudly at the lobby that you don t need to speak to me so rude but I didn t and I recommend you to claim the insurance instead of asking the hotel for assistance just a request I was completely and totally shocked by her unhelpful manner Next day morning the hotel manager has provided assistance after she understood the situation , Perfect Location
