277850,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, I booked this hotel because I wanted something special I dont mind paying more for a hotel if it comes with a good experience but this one was very underwhelming The room was generally OK but the bathroom was dated and dark The staff were very slow in both the bars and restaurants when your paying 7 euros for a bottle of water you expect more , The reception staff were good 
277851,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Our room was inexpensive so we were put in one of 3 rooms that were left untouched during the renovations It fit our minimal needs and our minimal budget , The breakfast was expensive but delicious The hotel is gorgeous The terrace restaurant outside has a nice ambiance 
277852,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, My wife and i can not think of anything we honestly can not think of anyway this Hotel etc etc can be improved A Big Thank You to all Staff Regards David Emma, Faultless in every way
277853,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Rooms were very outdated and given the location I don t think the best value for money , Staff were good and quite good pool area Close to the Metro station 
277854,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Very unfriendly towards customers front desk too many managers and not enough qualified personnel breakfast is expensive and not always good quality sometimes rotten fruits and vegetables from the day before The same with the fresh juice Toilet and shower in the room are very small not good for old and big persons in general building is not at usually high Fairmont standard,No Positive
277855,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Room decor is in need of a refresh new carpet curtains etc In room tech in need of an upgrade Typical old school 4 5 star hotel with no plug sockets near the bed very annoying Cheap kettle for making tea and coffee in the room should be a Nespresso or something similar , Very peaceful resort near to the city Very good food and friendly staff 
277856,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Room was very dated It feels like they ve spent all their money on the lobby and none on the rooms which is very disappointing after the wow of the lobby For example our carpet was threadbare Power sockets were in awkward places none near the bed or near the mirrors Drinks were very expensive 7 8 euro for a small glass of coke and closest convenience store seemed to be about 25 minute walk It s quite far out of town , The lobby and restaurant area are really nice you get quite a wow effect when you walk in The staff were friendly The pool is pretty good The BBQ restaurant was nice It s about 5 minutes walk from a metro station
277857,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Being woken up by maintenance at 1 30am to check leak in bathroom Grass around the pool areas , Newly renovated rooms great attention to detail Staff friendly helpful and polite 
277858,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, The food on the bar menu was quite expensive According to the in room guide the terrace restaurant was open until 11 30 pm but when we arrived at 10 59 pm the host refused to seat us explaining that the restaurant had just closed He did not care what the in room guide stated The restaurant was still full of guests some of whom were only just receiving their first course The rest of the staff however were very friendly and helpful ,No Positive
277859,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, The room was out of date there was stains on the chair the washroom had no shower you had to use the bath tub and wash like a pet dog the shower rack was so rusted u wouldn t dare put your towel on it the wall paper looked stained and was peeling this was barely a 2 star room the food at the restaurant in the hotel lobby was horrible they served us rotten prawns when we sent them back just the smell madeyou want to vomit this was worse Fairmont I ve ever encountered someone should demolish the building and build from scratch just horrible, They gave us free bottle of water that was the only good thing about this hotel
277860,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, The price of food and drink was extortionate There are no shops bars restaurants in the area to use instead of the hotel, The staff were helpful and attentive Rooms spacious and beds comfortable Modern rooms with great view
277861,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, The food at the hotel could have provided a wider range portion sizes were really variable and it was more expensive than restaurants in town , Lovely hotel and the staff went the extra mile to make sure we had a great trip from upgrading our room to restaurant recommendations to adjusting our check out time to suit our flight home The hotel is 20 mins from the city centre by metro making it perfect for a combined culture trip with chilled out days by the pool which was lovely and quiet The airport was 30 mins along one metro line so we didn t feel the need to taxi Would recommend and will return 
277862,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, The check out was slightly problematic I booked 7 nights for a set price My room was a classic room by the elevator that had not been upgraded It was shabby in places but was spacious and clean except for the carpet which needed a good shampoo or maybe it was just showing its age Anyway that was not a very bid deal 3 days into my stay there was a water problem requiring shut off I was not advised of this until I found a repairman in my room fixing things He said the water would run yellow for a short time In fact it ran dark orange with sandy sediment for 36 hours I had to shower at the spa Finally I went to the front desk and politely asked about the dark orange water and they very kindly offered to upgrade me to a refurbished room at the same price They offered this of their own accord and were very friendly and apologetic I can t say enough abou the friendliness and professionalism of the staff They are just great However when I checked out I was surprised at the final amount It was almost 1000 Euros more than the amount quoted by Billing com I asked to see the bill before paying as they did not present me first with an itemized bill The bill showed a rate of 422 Euros per night for the upgraded room and they tried to charge me that rate double the price of the booking com rate on the basis that I had changed rooms So I had to explain everything the problem with the water the offer of a free upgrade to a new person at the desk who was skeptical and so then I had to get out my booking com confirmation and insist politely that the Booking com rate be adhered to Finally she agreed but it was concerning to me that they had not entered the correct rate in the first place I I have stayed at many Fairmont hotels and they always present an itemized bill first before asking for the payment Often this bill is delivered the night before checkout , The large pool was great in the hot weather The adjoining restaurant The Terrace is very pleasant and the food is good The staff did their utmost to please and were very friendly helpful and professional I really enjoyed the level of service offered The main bar is quite impressive My upgraded room had a great view and the classic room view was fine too A classic room appears to be a room that has not yet been upgraded however it was more than adequate for the price I had asked to be on an upper floor and this was not a problem This is a large conference hotel so there are large groups of business people who use the hotel and give it a lively atmosphere There is lovely large garden with shade and benches near the second pool Proximity to the metro this large hotel is not located downtown but a short walk to the Metro station gives you many bus choices as well as the opportunity to take the L3 metro line straight to Passeig de Gracia I took the Metro all over the city and often on the spur of the moment 
277863,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Food and drink at the hotel very expensive 7 euro for a beer 6 or for a 200ml bottle of coke or 330ml water Burger and chips 21 euros was lovely but way over priced on check out was charged for stay after already paying bookings com in advance I was again charge by hotel checking out bill should of been 150 but ended up being nearly 600 this meant I couldn t afford food or water for me and my son at in airport on route home and couldnt get home once landed back in liverpool as I didnt have any money left Hotel wasnt interested in this just wanted the money as I didnt have a bank statement with me to prove I had paid this was supposed to be a holiday in a life time for me and my son to a 5 star hotel for his birthday and I have ended up with no money and now the task of having to try and get a refund Thanks ,No Positive
277864,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, No restaurant instead a lobby type of food service Furniture in room very old need to change this reflects a very poor administration Location far from city center No nearby walking distance restaurant I don t recommend it It does not reflect a Fairmont quality hotel , Design of hotel
277865,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Nothing special, Nice roomes not very big Very good and smiling staff Good breakfast Close to the metro and big avenue but quiet Nice gardens swimming pool
277866,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Not a single option for food or drinks in a waking distance For anything else subway is an option that closes at midnight , Perfect hotel if you are attending a meeting at the convention center in front of it or if you are planning to go for a Barcelona soccer game Far away of everything else Good breakfast with healthy options The bar of the hotel is good complete and well served 
277867,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, It s a bit far from famous tourist attractions 40 50 minutes walking time and 10 15 with a cab , The bed was really comfortable staff were friendly and it s location is amazing especially for a supporter of FC Barcelona as it s close to Camp Nou 
277868,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Staff tried two times to charge me a higher value than I reserved by booking com I had to insist to change it , Rooms are really spacious Excellent bed Very good bathroom 
277869,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, for indoor swimming pool schedules for children in the morning from 10 to 11 in the evening from 3 to 5 I think they can expand the hours as it is a Resort, great staff
277870,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I,No Negative, Amazing staff specially mentioning Doriane and Ismail were super helpful and supportive Every penny that you spend there is worth it You WILL agree with this after youvisit there once 
277871,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, No complains , I arrived early because I my plane landed a little earlier than expected and was allowed to check in about 2 hours ahead of schedule The check in was very smooth If you are attending a conference in the University area this hotel is just a few minutes walk away from the campus buildings Alternatively if you want to explore the city there is a metro station really close by that will allow you to access other parts of the city really quickly The hotel room itself was pretty large and clean with a very comfortable bed Perfect for when traveling for business purposes 
277872,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, The air conditioning system was not working properly over the night could get a little bit cold , The room is big has tea coffee facilities The bed is very comfortable Huge windows with nice view over the tennis yards The garden is nice well taken care of This hotel seems to be famous for the private events organized in the garden 
277873,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, At the arrival they didn t have our room and first tried with the question whether we wanted an upgraded room and to pay additionally When we answered that we are completely happy with our choice the lady went somewhere inside and in two minutes smiling she told us that they have a surprise for us and that previously she offered for money upgraded suite is now for free We were forced to Pay immediately our room what is surprising And at leave they wanted to charge us 83 euros for bar which we did not use then she said that she sees that it was a mistake but that we have to pay 23 euros for coffee at the bar and so on And so on ,No Positive
277874,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Breakfast option expensive no nearby options to eat out at dinner , Very comfortable and extremely clean hotel lovely views of Barcelona from hotel room friendly staff very close to metro and tram 
277875,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Location was far from any restaurants taxi ride or metro into centre to get food Problem was in house Restaurant served poor overpriced food Approx 20 euros for a plain tomato pasta in a bowl , Comfortable recently renovated room Staff were nice Couldnt open the window though for fresh air Nice toiletries in bathroom shower small In room iron ironing board kettle teas etc safe Made getting ready easier and quicker 
277876,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, The rate I had to pay was more than I was informed by booking com the room turned out to be was 981 12 it would also be very helpful to inform us of the insurance we had to pay because it was 700 euros and the furniture especially the carpets is a little worn down, The lobby is beautiful
277877,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, The fascinating Starship like lobby key feature of the beauty of the place chanelsbthe sound of the lobby up to the rooms Take a suite so the separation door buffers the background sound, Such a high standard of customer care We had two minor issues with the room and they were but our side until the checkout including gifts and upgrade 100 stars for the staff dedication to make you happy
277878,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, The first room we stayed in was on the sixth floor and hadn t been refurbished it was very dated the carpets were faded and the light fitting was hanging off the wall When we complained we were moved to the forth floor and the room was lovely The only down side was the wasn t a dressing table and it was awkward getting ready , The hotel was beautifully styled
277879,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, The staff didn t abid to the booking commitments in the rate after a long discussion they give me the right rate also they didn t coordinate with each other and they really upset me, Building
277880,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Nothing to complain, Loved the view and the renovated rooms as well as the different breakfast choices and the excellent meeting and work out facilities
277881,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, The air conditioning was a little temperamental but they sent staff up immediately to fix it , I attended a conference here Nov 2016 and found the rooms wonderful and the bar lobby area really stylish with plenty of spaces to work socialise and have dinner The food was exceptionally good the rooms were very comfortable The hotel is undergoing renovations hidden well as you can t tell so ask for a recently renovated room upon arrival 
277882,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, It is unacceptable for the 5 hotel to limit the entry to the swimming pool and fitness area to ADULTS ONLY The hotel advertises its fitness and spa facilities as one of its kind allegedly the best in class It s partially true it is the only 5 star hotel that I know which misleads its guests in relation to one of the most basic features I was advised by the reception assistant to go to one of several sport clubs in the vicinity of the hotel The lady at the fitness club entrance didn t even try to come up with any idea How helpful isn t it The worst was of course my son s dissapointment One can say that you can survive without a pool for a weekend of course you can but guests should be openly informed about such limitations in advance especially in a 5 hotel , I stayed at this hotel for the 2nd time Recently with the group of friends parents with children enjoying both the quality of the hotel and its location This time I was alone with my 9y o son In general we had a great father son weekend though mainly out of the hotel The expected quality of the hotel was supposed to match the convenience related to watching the FC Barcelona game Location is still its best feature The hotel has unfortunately changed since we stayed here some time ago 
277883,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I,No Negative, Very nice and Modern Hotel with nice rooms and access to sport activities Quite away from the city center but very close of a Subway line going to the city center and directly to the airport
277884,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, We booked the new renovated room the furniture was good but didn t look new to me housekeeping needs improvement bed was not comfortable , Very nice and helpful door and reception staff it was my birthday so they upgraded our room and brought us cake and juice to celebrate I liked the design of the lobby hotel near l illa shopping mall and the football stadium
277885,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Room needed to be refurbished electricity hairdreyer bad functioning not fixed after a complaint Very noisy in the morning banging doors starting at 5 30 AM , Location Facilities especially garden and swimming pool 
277886,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, The shower door leaked onto the bathroom floor badly The room lights were a bit awkward to figure out There are 4 pre programmed settings with no on off for any one fixture The scrambled eggs for breakfast were terrible Use REAL eggs instead of the powdered ones please There s no nice sit down restaurant at this hotel but there is a lobby area with tables and chairs where food can be purchased as you enjoy your beverages from the bar , Situated just 15 20 minutes from the airport this hotel has stunning views of Barcelona from the upper rooms From our room we had a panoramic view of the Barcelona FC stadium National Museum of Art the Olympic stadium the airport and all the way to the Mediteranean Sea We even were treated to a nightly fireworks show All rooms are accessible via internal hallways that open to the lobby below Our room on the 9th floor was modern and nicely appointed The entire facility was new and very well maintained The staff could NOT have been more accommodating or nicer to work with Room service was prompt and very professional The food was excellent try the club sandwich or penne pasta we d had plenty of tapas while touring and wanted something more familiar There are plenty of elevators that operate quickly to get you from the upper floors to the lobby area and back Two of them give you a view of the expansive lobby as it climbs to your floor This is an excellent location for touring the city Taxis are lined up 24 hours a day Easy traveling to all the top sight seeing destinations within 20 30 minutes We felt safe on and around the grounds Not any traffic noise as this hotel isn t located in the super busy tourist area Even if the nightly rate is slightly more than other options in Barcelona give this hotel a try we didn t see any other hotel in or around the city we wish we d have chosen instead 
277887,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, n a, Everything was great as opposed to all the bad reviews food was amazing the pools and ambience of the hotel is soo good Our room was just as we requested and most of all the staff was amazing Everyone was very helpful sweet and friendly Well located just by the metro its location is beautiful Place is like a dream at night with all the beautiful lights being lit up
277888,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, The property is being renovated but for 230 euros you expect a 5 star room from fairmont not a 2 start worn out room When I spoke they upgraded me with a supplement of 30 euros per night So ask for renovated room only Staff are very helpful housekeeping needs to be better , Staff are warm and helpful 
277889,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Small room for price Room service expensive Sending breakfast to room feels like rip off 9 15 euro per person on top of having breakfast included Not very close to city center, Very friendly staff The breakfast good Next to Barcelona stadium walking distance Less people in shops near hotel compared to city center you can find seat in Starbucks 
277890,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, we got checked in a room just beneath a floor under renovation unbearably noisy this room should not have been allocated to anybody As a matter of fact we had to change rooms No extra pillows provided in the rooms , Exceptional architectural features of the inside building atrium Fantastic gardens ping pong table different pools one quiet one for kids inside pools Excellent C I by Bianca 
277891,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Breakfast pricing was out of line with the room cost I felt at an eye watering 29 although I was offered a deal and takeaway coffee at 5 50 a cup seemed very steep to me Still a very lovely place to stay though , Stylish modern hotel with beautiful well kept outdoor pools set in lush gardens with large gymnasium and many other comforts The hotel is currently upgrading rooms there is no sign of any building work or noise however and the amazing deals apply to guests staying in rooms which have yet to be upgraded I stayed in one such room and thought it was actually fantastic with lots of space and a beautiful spotless bathroom Staff were great and the hotel is a short walk from the metro the short and easy ride into town An oasis 
277892,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I,No Negative, We were a grandmother and grandson travelling around Europe together and our stay at this hotel was exceptional There is nothing that did not please us The Staff were exceptional polite courteous attentive and considerate The Hotel room was perfect and large and clean The pools were terrific and we can not say enough good reports It is ideally located within two minutes walk from the metro that takes one straight into the heart of the city It is about a twenty minute ride by metro to the city centre The Hotel is airy and whilst it is clearly designed for families in mind this was not a problem regarding a noise element The pool area was large and the playground for small children more than enough The weather was perfect and we cannot wait to return 
277893,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Receptionis give it to me wrong information about swimming pool open hours Which make me little bit upset coz we use swimming pool only 5 minutes Also rescuer on swimming pool was extremely rude After all General manager came to our room and apologies us Also make it discount of mini bar to make us more happy , Nice and very helpful stuff 
277894,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, At the moment nothing , I loved this place The hotel grounds are huge and a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city We chose this place purely because of the location and size Two amazing pools and an incredible gym The staff were amazing the check in process was fast Everything was easy I m definitely coming back Catching the metro is so easy too Just 5mins up the road and you are in the city in less than 10mins This is the perfect hotel in Barcelona Spend the day having fun in the city then retreat back to your quiet hotel full of cool things to do 
277895,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, The prices in the hotel were excessive 18 for a basic salad 6 for a soft drink , The room rates were great value and the hotel was nicely decorated 
277896,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Breakfast and drinks very pricey , Great ambiance exceptionally helpful and knowledgeable staff gym and pool facilities were excellent The hotel is located in a lovely area with lovely shopping facilities Five minute walk to nearest metro station and 10 min walk from Nou Camp Though we were there whilst the hotel is undergoing renovation these are being undertaken so sensitively that guests are unaware these are happening
277897,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, No welcome notes not even a free bottle of water in the room when checking in Shockingly slow expensive and rude service ordered a simply burger and club sandwich for my kids at 10 30 pm at the lobby bar Also some of the pool staff tall lifeguard very impolite The pools seem also be closed often due to private functions Hotel is quite isolated not close to anything at all , Gorgeous lobby and elevator nice big pool area Nice view to the city and a polo club my kids loved to see the horses training on the mornings 
277898,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, We would have eaten in the restaurant one or two nights and would certainly have had breakfast but at 20 Euro each for breakfast and a son who would have 2 slices of toast it just didn t make sense , The staff were extremely helpful and unobtrusive Frank on the concierge desk was especially helpful advising which sites it would be a good idea to book tickets for in advance The hotel has an beautiful lobby and lounge and the room we stayed in was extremely quiet which certainly can t be said of another supposedly 5 star we stayed at recently We stayed in one of the refurbished rooms overlooking the city towards the sea which again was faultless and had efficient and quiet air conditioning 
277899,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, I first got a twin room when I had booked a double they changed me after a lot of arguing and wanted to charge me extra The rooms are very dated for the spec of the building No tea or coffee , The building itself is amazing as well as the common areas the staff in the swimming pool area are very friendly everything was very clean 
277900,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I,No Negative, The place is absolutely amazing location design comfort All staff very friendly and helpful The Terace is just the perfect place for dinner In one word Anazing
277901,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Poor maintenance A C was not working properly No drinking water in the room Only shampoo and shower cap Can not make tea or coffee in the room , The size of the hotel and design 
277902,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Nothing, Staffs were polite and helpful and check in and chack out was fast the room view was exce lent and very delicious dinner i had at the restaurant near pool
277903,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, We were offered to use the executive lounge all day long for 80 euros where there would always be something to eat from breakfast till night But we were advised the food on offer will be a few minor options and snacks We tried this one day but we re very unimpressed by what was on offer and not having a staff member there present to help the customers only made the experience worse The staff were very professional and apologetic when we gave them feedback about it and they even refunded us the money as they acknowledged that a staff member should have been there but they were short staffed that day so the lounge was uncovered at times Also I would have liked a balcony on the room to allow smoking but none of the rooms seemed to have a balcony Having said that having a cigarette downstairs while enjoying the amazing green view of the garden and trees in front of the hotel was great, My wife and I stayed in Barcelona for our honeymoon where we stayed at Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos hotel The room was absolutely fantastic great view very spacious very large comfortable king bed and a very nice and comfy living room in the double executive room The staff were extremely friendly and sent us a bottle of champagne and a large desert complimentary when they found out we were on honeymoon and were very pleasant and professional throughout The pool and gym facility were really nice and with a very nice garden and restaurant outside Location was a bit of a distance from the sea and city centre but the nice and quoted surrounding was nice in the evenings and anyway so the metro station is just 5 min walk outside the hotel and in no more than 20 mins you will be in downtown for a very low cost on the metro Also for those of us who are football fans the hotel is a short walking distance from the Nou Camp Stadium Overall very satisfied in this luxurious trendy and comfortable hotel and would definitely highly recommend it
277904,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Shuttle bus that was listed like extra when i was doing the reservation but on arrival i was told that is no longer available , Very good location far from the noisy traffic and at the same time close to everything metro station is right about the corner One tip for the arrivals Easiest and fastest way from airport to hotel is with metro Just ask wich line is going to Zona Universitaria Staff is extremely kind and polite 
277905,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Staff at lunch time at the Terrace were a bit inattentive and chaotic which lead to an incorrect bill , Fitness spa and pool facilities were gorgeous Our room was very comfortable and spacious Food at the terrace was delightful and serving staff were wonderful in the evening 
277906,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Long way from the gothic quarter Traffic meant that it was quite a trek to get down to the Port for dinner Door key not brilliant and the door doesn t have an auto close mechanism so take care that the door shuts properly when you leave the room , Beautiful hotel newly decorated and equipped Gorgeous Grounds Pool and Gymnasium Close to Nou Camp great tour and the Polo Club Great views of the city from my room on floor 10 Great views of a really impressive atrium Incredibly helpful and polite staff A must 
277907,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, It was way too crowded on a Saturday night and understaffed It took over an hour to even be asked if we wanted something to drink Totally unacceptable when they knew we were coming It was not close to the downtown area Convenient to the university but not the tourist section , I like Fairmonts so that had it going for it 
277908,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, No kettle or tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms The prices inside the hotel were extortionate 8 for a bottle of water As there is nothing close by they get away with charging ridiculous prices for everything , Rooms were nice Hotel facilities were good

277916,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Isolated from shops and food outlets Only expensive food options No tea or coffee facilities in room No ironing board iron I didn t find out the bottle of water in the room was free until the last day bc priced at 6 in the restaurant , Close to the convention centre Silver service from friendly staff Style of room was classic formal not yet renovated and of a standard for high level politicians business people I guess The plans for renovations look nice Amazing views to city in distance and view to stadium of FC Barcelona close by 
277917,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I,No Negative, The staff was most attentive to our every need The concierge was very helpful in making suggestions He also made excellent arrangements for dinner and attractions we wanted to see 
277918,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, We stayed for 3 nights the first was without a mattress then asked the following morning for a mattress topper which i felt was more polite Definitely a waste of money and we felt it was a waste We have previously visited fairmount in canada and are aware of there normal high standards I don t normally review hotels as a rule but felt i had to on this occasion, staff where able to provide the basic amenities when asked but as a regular traveller these were very basic such as a mattress for the bed kettle and cups with sachets of tea and coffee also required an iron which was not steam and we were quite shocked as we thought with building work ongoing they would have pulled the stops on the contrary it was the opposite 
277919,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, There wasn t a kettle in the room The heating wasn t working I had to ask twice for an extra blanket, Very helpful receptionist Anna Handy for the conference Daily transport to la pedrera

277923,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Too busy not enough staff We waited 25 minutes in a long queue to book in When we went to dinner we waited 20 minutes and nobody approached us to give us a menu never mind a drink so we resorted to sandwiches in the buffet in the foyer All the items on the hot breakfast were cold The location was at least 20 minutes from the centre of Barcelona and was very isolated , The reception staff the cleaning staff and the manager of the concierge suite were all courteous and professional
277924,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Lobby toilets awful nasty smell and very old such hotel should spend money renewing all the rooms and facilities not only some, Great hotel overall friendly and helpful staff great view and big room comfy bed and good breakfast

277929,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, The above was supposed to be what I did not like I would not return to this hotel unless all the others were unavailable and I had nowhere else to sleep, Expect snobby staff pools for kids crowded dirty lawns for all day including dirty towels sigaret boxes ashtrays on individual sunbeds not cleaned off for the entire day Staff who will serve you only if you Spanish Not enough Sunbeds On the other hand the adult pool where kids are not allowed is clean and orderly with full staff and if you go with kids they whisk you off like a disease No kids play area unless you count one swing as such To call concierge will require at least 4 10 calls and no possibility to call the front desk Television channels only in Spanish and no pay channels available or maybe the option did not work in 2 rooms I booked Telephone had to be changed as it was broken but not before 1 full day The gym timing are ridiculous for international hotel as in weekends including Saturday closed until 9 or 10 am so if you want to do gym before breakfast which ends at 10 or if you have kids who want to go out totally forget it If you complain they will look at you like you crazy and spoiled and don t take the complaint On top of that the hotel is happy to entertain large groups of hairdressers who get totally wasted fueled by party in hotel kids pool until 4 30 am with loud music screaming etc so no one else can sleep but today the instant profit is No1 On top of that the shuttle bus to town has broken exhaust or such as the whole buss fills with exhaust fumes This is not just empty ranting I have travelled 35 years extensively and I would rate this hotel 3 stars NO more 
277930,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, For a five stars hotel there is no water and no kettle in the room The bed sheets were worned With the Deluxe rooms you don t have a free access to the lounge It s not a five stars hotel the best a four stars, The location
277931,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Housekeeping weren t very good with providing us with items we needed even after several calls The rooms are outdated and bathroom smelled very bad at night and we had to keep the door shut , I loved the pools out of everything Location great for shopping and away from tourist areas 
277932,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, Receptionists at the front disck were not so professional to deal with different nationalities and cultures I noticed during my stay they were always a long Waiting probably 10 to 15 minutes waiting for each client think more training should be done , Wonderful location facilities and entertainment for families
277933,Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos I, The only thing that I d caution someone on is that the hotel is a bit far a 30 minute metro ride from the city center and the prime tourist attractions The metro is close by and convenient so this wasn t an issue for me but if I was coming for tourism rather than business I would consider staying downtown One final note as with most business hotels the food on site is a bit pricey If you re willing to walk a bit there are a number of eateries that are not too far way to go to for lunch For dinner I would recommend taking the metro or a taxi to go somewhere in the city , I came to Barcelona for a conference and the site of our congress was a convenient walk from the hotel The room was clean and the staff were great They had a map of a running route that went through the university that was fun They also gave some great recommendations for restaurants Also I need to receive a package via post and it was delivered while I was there and was waiting in my room There is also a recreation center next door less than one minute that was quite pleasant Also if you re there for business the wireless works I didn t have much luck at other hotels in Barcelona with their WiFi All in all it was great experience
