193541,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, Nothing all of our needs were catered for , The staff couldn t have been more helpful I took my pet chihuahua with me they had made her a bed in our room and put bowls out ready for our arrival The hotel facilities are out of this world Went out in the evening and when we came back the staff had already changed our towels and brought us fresh bath robes We thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel 
193542,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, Mixup with payment that came in as an inconvenience that the staff was most helpful with Wharf side of the hotel is not livable to me it s overlooking ugly concrete constructions and supernoisy 24 7, Excellent staff very helpful indeed I was very disappointed when I realised I ve booked not the facing Thames view so the staff upgraded me to river view just to make me happy 
193543,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, No tea coffee making facilities Breakfast overpriced and indeed so was the room for what you got nowt Everything was priced 3 for pringles and 2 50 for a Snickers bar outrageous And a whopping 21 for a half bottle of so so Rioja Water wasn t even free disappointing Overall hotel had no personality or character , Location is good re overlooking the Thames but it s not all good re depending on which room you are in 302 the view is obscured by buildings in front Clean and comfortable room Customer Service was ok and efficient just not terribley customer friendly 
193544,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, It was very expensive we knew that when we booked but I expected a bit more Housekeeping did not remove empty glasses cold coffee cups from our room There was no tea making facilities in the room just a Nespresso machine I had to ask for our toiletries to be replenished as they left one small bottle of each for two people for 2 days The staff seemed bored and the hotel appeared empty It was soulless Not a place for families far more geared up for the business clientele Next time we go to London we will stay in the centre and try and find a hotel with some character , The reception staff were very friendly The view was nice but we had paid a lot for it 
193545,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, Mosty everything , 5 i think not I would not rate this hotel as 3 Only one robe provided for a deluxe suit for two No water provided Dirty sheets Prolonged room service No spa or pool on site as stated Secluded location within inner london Late night partys held within rooms with no respect given to working visitors Food not up to standard Drug use on the permises which is overlooked by staff Overall not an ideal hotel 
193546,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, The concierge did not book the taxi we asked for so we missed the start of our show on the West end The staff at breakfast were hopeless so we ate breakfast out of the hotel on our second morning , Lovely views of London and the Thames
193547,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, The hotel was soulless even though it was expensive and looked great it lacked character The key cards weren t working and we were locked out at midnight albeit they eventually sent someone up , Lovely hotel right on the river Thames with amazing views 
193548,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, I can honestly not think of anything that could be improved This is an absolute jewel of a hotel and we enjoyed every minute, This was truly 5 star service impeccable incredible room with panoramic view of the Thames wonderful terrace for drinks and the complimentary use of infinity pool hydrotherapy pools and gym all contributed to a fantastic experience The staff are incredibly professional friendly and efficient and the food is first class A truly special place in a wonderful location
193549,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, No negatives , I chose this based on location No complaints and what I would expect from a hotel of this price and rating The staff were helpful and posted some personal items I had left in my room They did this the same day 
193550,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, The only small change the shower s water stream wasn t great An overhead rainshower or multi way hand held overhead shower would be better, The view was fabulous and making window sests in the big picture window is a great idea Ferry to city centre is next door Good restaurants shops close by 
193551,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, Everything was fine A very great place to stay , The staff were very polite Rooms very clean The next morning we watched the British marathon from are bedrooms 
193552,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, Outdated electronics in the room Ipod iphone speaker only fits iphone 4 The tv was very outdated had limited channels, Room view was amazing great service from staff yummy room service 
193553,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, Couldn t fault the hotel or the staff, The staff were very friendly and attentive Especially Catalado the barman and the concierge on Saturday morning when we checked in 
193554,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, Staff at desk were sometimes a bit rude and patronising and didn t seem like they knew what they doing some times , Hotel was gorgeous room was amazing with a stunning view and modern feel and I asked for the romantic package and it was all set out for when me and my boyfriend arrived Had breakfast in restaurant was delicious and waitresses really nice Man at the door was so nice 
193555,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, The In Room Breakfast menu was very confusing as we only wanted a light breakfast asking for just eggs with toast and coffee and ended up with two full English breakfasts When we explained one English Breakfast was removed from the bill Very enjoyable breakfast in the end , Luxury hotel with excellent discreet friendly service Very good location with river views and suite very comfortable We really enjoyed our weekend 
193556,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, Bit expensive to use each time we visit London but then you get what you pay for as they say , Staff were super friendly and helpful Easy to get to 02 Spa facilities lovely 
193557,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, It was just right , Very helpful staff Great location generous sized room comfortable bed with lovely cotton bedclothes and a big bathroom with a bath Easy connection to the Thames Clipper service to and from the 02
193558,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, Breakfast was poor minimal choice items not replenished how can you run out of white bread My wife cannot eat brown bread as it makes her ill but was told only brown left and no more so she went without not the kind of response you expect from a 5 star hotel, Good location friendly staff
193559,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, In room hospitality charges were ridiculous 9 for a miniature JD 3 50 for water Also on the Saturday night boy racers seem to meet up in the road tunnels and rev their engines Was a bit like living at Silverstone Not hotels fault obviously and at least they seemed to get bored after an hour , Early check in Huge room with great facilities Wonderful comfortable bed Staff were very friendly Great location 
193560,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, There was a rugged welcome for my wife at the front desk as she had not made the reservation and I was not present , The view on the Thames is amazing 
193561,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, Nothing , Very friendly and helpful staff We were there very briefly as we had a ball to go to on the Saturday evening and then were up early to ride the RideLondon 100 It was a great location for the start of the ride and we were allowed to leave our car for the day at no extra charge Expensive for so few hours there but would stay there again next year and hopefully for longer next time 
193562,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, We were not happy that our 15 year old son could not use the swimming pool after 11am Despite having explained that he is a sensible teenager nearly six foot tall training to be a life guard Therefore quite able to look after himself , Room service was prompt and excellent nothing was too much trouble The travel phone provided was a welcome support around London Thank you
193563,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, Nothing, The hotel staff made our visit extra special as we were celebrating our son s 18th We would like to thank them for this and would come back again Best breakfast we have tasted in a hotel 
193564,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, The only gripe is we have to ask for the beverage tray on each check in as it isn t in the room as standard However it always arrives promptly , A wonderful hotel that feels luxurious spacious and with excellent service Staff are always attentive helpful and polite The gym and spa is beautiful with fantastic views across the river The food is stunning both breakfast the restaurant and room service too 
193565,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, uber could never find this hotel because there s a westferry overground station a westferry road and the hotel is on westferry circus an extra note for directions would be helpful , staff was so well mannered we were treated like royalty amazing view as well will be coming back 
193566,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, Nothing everything was perfect They couldn t have been more helpful, From the moment I arrived the hotel went out of there way to help The young lady behind reception was very helpful and made sure I had everything The room was brilliant the bed was perfect both bathroom stunning and the living room relaxing 
193567,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, Snacks like a sandwich a little bit expensive , Lovely staff very clean hotel an elegant place to stay Pool over looking the river Thames was fabulous

193569,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, Didn t get no sleep Fighting and banging crying women shouting for help Was a right funny old night , Hotel was spot on wanted a nice hotel and it was that
193570,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, The service of the staff at check in All though I ve stayed here before with no problems I had issues checking in because I didn t have photo ID once someone who knew what they were doing arrived there were no problems It s just a shame all the staff weren t as helpful , The location
193571,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, The price of room and breakfast , Nothing wrong with the room at all but very expensive for what it is it is all about the location and that river view 
193572,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, the only thing I could comment on was the price of parking which we felt was a lot to ask on top of the cost of the stay , The staff were all amazing from the greeting at the door the moment we arrived everything was taken care of and we were made to feel welcome valued and that they cared about the little things like where our car was parked and helping with the luggage which had been left in the car we had been unable to park outside the hotel due to a road closure nearby and massive of roadworks which totally confused the Satnav and had made finding the hotel at all quite stressful all taken care of and car moved for us so we didn t have to go back for the luggage luggage bought up to our room within minutes As it was my birthday the house sent up a beautiful cake that was a complete surprise We loved the staff they were all lovely and were genuinely interested in our plans and wanting to know if there was anything they could do to help us get the most out of our stay the room had a huge window with an amazing view of the river and The Shard The bay window seat allowed us to sit and take it all in as the light changed with the onset of evening loved it from start to finish and didn t want to leave 
193573,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, The bath handle showed rust or dirt underneath them the bathroom floor had dirty Staines like it hadn t been washed for awhile we was told at the check in that the breakfast charge was 14 a head but we were charged 23 , Nice comfortable big bed nice shower bath 
193574,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel,No Negative, Excellent staff spent a relaxing evening at the hotel for my partners birthday we also brought our dog with us They brought dog bowls and a dog bed to the room upon arrival all staff were super friendly and helpful Room service was amazing and the room was spotless being a clean freak I always find something wrong with the rooms however I did not here I fully recommend it Also amazing views
193575,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, The hotel is really tricky to find and there is no point typing the postcode in a sat nav as it doesn t work Best advice would be to ring the hotel and ask them to direct you they clearly get asked this question a lot so are quite good at it The other thing I found unusual is without advising me they took 65 off my card just in case we used any extras we didn t so then had to wait 5 days for the money to go back on my card Not the end of the world just an annoyance , This hotel had a very luxurious feel The rooms were large and the view was outstanding Definitely pay that little bit extra for the view it is so worth it Bathroom and tub is also large The bed was so comfy and definitely 5 This is a gorgeous hotel the staff were very welcoming and happy to help where they could The complimenatary use of the spa was fantastic The spa pools made it that little more special Would definitely return to this hotel 
193576,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, Staff breakfast stained sofas in the breakfast room just arrived no one helps with the luggage we booked a deluxe king room and were given a room of a lower category on the 2nd floor , Bed and amenities

193579,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, In room dining Very well organised but the food is poor No terraces in the hotel You feel stocked No upgrades or presents with a ten nights stay , Super comfortable beds Nice lighting of the rooms
193580,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, No tea or coffee making facilities in room which was disappointing given the price of the hotel , A lovely spacious room with a fantastic view unexpected as very kindly upgraded Luxury toiletries and an overall sense of comfort Friendly helpful staff Delicious food and drink from prompt and friendly room service staff Also the turn down service was great and much appreciated 
193581,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, All OK, Great location and we had a great river view Using the fast clipper service to central London was very good but at 6 50 each way for each person can get expensive
193582,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, Poor signage to the Virgin Health club which is just behind the Hotel but its hard to find the entrance, Great location near both Canary Wharf and Westferry Circus station and the Canary Wharf pier but if you are driving very hard to find they need more signs to point to the right entrance Also there are some good restaurants nearby by the river

193587,Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel, A bit remote from the City and the traffic is rather congested and slow 20mph in certain parts of the road It is a good spot for visitors who intend to stay in the East side of London but not for those who need to travel to the City frequently , A very nice hotel with friendly and helpful staff The room is spacious comfortable bright and clean The food room service we ordered is good and parking service is excellent The garden terrace with its quite and beautiful environment is a relaxing area for spending an afternoon cocktail Wifi is complimentary although a bit slow as compare with other hotels we had stayed
