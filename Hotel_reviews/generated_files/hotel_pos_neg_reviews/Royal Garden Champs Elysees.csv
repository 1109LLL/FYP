106483,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, I was honestly happy with my tray but the checkout could have been faster with just an extra person at the counter, Our family apartment was just the right size and space for my family of six I loved the wardrobes and that we had plenty if storage space for our stuff
106484,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, I didn t like the staff cleanliness access to the rooms bad smell lost info at front desk no AC made pay twice my mistake and locked the amount,No Positive
106485,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Really everything was great even the old elevator was kind of cool , The apartment was great We have our own terrace big bathroom clean and fabulous breakfast The walk from the hotel to places was about 10 minutes but totally worth it The staff very helpful and nice 
106486,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, The staff friendly but hotel is totally mis sold online it is dated and has no facilities also rooms not modern like pics and was still dirty no air con working a t v was broken not happy after paying 550 for two nights in my birthday, Staff
106487,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, They speak very poor English I stayed one night without AC No body works on Saturday and Sunday Everything freeze till Monday Internet is very bad and weak, Location is good Kids loved that we have 2 connecting rooms
106488,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Rooms and hallways didnt have enough lighting , Nightmare When we checked in the air conditioning was not working but they told us they are doing something about it The whole night was very uncomfortable Will never recommend it 
106489,Royal Garden Champs Elysees,No Negative, The weather was extremely hot when I arrived at this facility There was a very nice cooling unit in the room when I arrived and somehow when I returned later in the evening after meeting clients the cooling unit had disappeared from the room The staff could not tell me how this was removed In addition this hotel needs total renovation as the decor and accommodations are very smoky and old 
106490,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, The room It was loud as it was directly overlooking Rue Faubourg Saint Honor I d requested a quiet room It had a large disconnected mobile air conditioning unit taking up quite a lot of space The wifi was patchy in the room ok if you stood at the bedroom door The light coloured carpet was stained in a couple of places it looked dirty The furniture was certainly not of the quality level of a 4 star hotel Photos attached At breakfast the coffee cappucino was served in a small coffee pot pre sweetened without froth The fresh fruit salad was pre prepared in little glasses and other fresh fruit needed to be peeled and cut to be eaten messy and not practicable The scrambled eggs were so salty they were inedible At 166 euros for room and board this was no deal it was a decidedly bad deal I d advise giving this hotel a miss , The bed was comfortable The shower was quite powerful 
106491,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Bed broke while I was sleeping Sheets weren t changed in any of the 3 days Heat was broken They said they had a restaurant I had a menu in the bedroom but when I called to ask for room service they didn t know what I was talking about ,No Positive
106492,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, It was a very hot weekend in Paris during the time we stayed The AC was not available No worries though keep a window open and at night the room will cool down , Good location with free parking for genius members The underground parking is very tight and I recommend you ask for assistance from the staff before attempting to park I drive a Hyundai Sonata and was able to find a nice spot I also saw SUV s underground in the same area Its a short walk to the Arc de Triomphe and the metro The staff are very professional and friendly 
106493,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, The towels were terrible very dirty and smelly , The bed was very comfortable had a great night sleep The breakfast was nice The staff were very helpful
106494,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, First of all the four stars given to the property is deceiving The property does not look like a 4 star hotel at all The check in and check out was not swift and took a lot of time The furniture in the room was old There was a crack in the bathroom ceiling The coridors had a smoky smell and of damp ,No Positive
106495,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Bit smelly in the lift Doesn t have a restaurant to eat in at night , Bed was comfortable and the pillows and Doona Close to major attractions Great shuttle service to the airport Most staff very helpful 
106496,Royal Garden Champs Elysees,No Negative, The room was absolutely fine and clean The shower was a very good one The staff were exceptionally good and the location fantastic We eat in a very good but quite expensive restaurant opposite 
106497,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, The hotel reception were very dismissive and not accommodating at all Very much felt like the gentlemen did not want to talk to us or adhere to our request Very disappointed and felt quite discriminated At one point the gentleman had said we was disturbing him from doing his work and then mumbled under his breath As if paper work was more important than the customer in front of you awaiting check in ,No Positive
106498,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, The rooms are horrible Very old furniture Broken roof Bathroom facilities are old Towels are of poor material and conditions Pellows are uncomfortable at all No room service They offer you to order from restaurants that offer a delivery Definitely will not come again , The location which is few minutes walk away from the champs elysee
106499,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, The only complaint I have is the front desk forgot to give me a wake up call , The concierge was knowledgeable caring and extremely helpful The bed was comfortable and the room was nice and clean Extreme value for the money and great location The last hotel I stayed in was more money less of a location and not half the hotel as the Royal Garden Champs Elysees Paris 
106500,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, The furnishings were outdated making the bathroom look dirty but I think the tiles were just old and damaged The bed was really terrible One of the water bottles provided was half empty when we arrived , The location of the hotel was really great shops just around the corner and lots of great restaurants to choose from Staff were very friendly and helpful and breakfast was good too 
106501,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, It was dated looked old and dilapidated I was cold and no extra blankets Staff weren t very friendly or welcoming , It was clean and close to all the attractions
106502,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, It was very dated and shabby without the chic in need of a complete makeover and upgrade Hard to see how it has a 4 star rating , The location and size of the room were good and staff were charming
106503,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, I paid city tax by credit card and found the staff charged more Even though he returned the difference by cash his attitude was as if I should tell him earlier and didn t say sorry Mold in bathtub area not many restaurants nearby, Value for money Near to Arc de Triumph and public transport Room was warm in winter Had all necessary facilities bathtub fridge electric kettle and hair dryer which not mentioned in their description 
106504,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Guest toilet facility was a bit hidden at reception, Nice place to stay in the hearthh of Paris at a walking distance of the Champs Elyses Confort and staff very mannered 
106505,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, See above, There was a distinct smell of urine in the chambre near the toulet Rhis really needs to be corrected If I had stYed another day I would have insisted on a room without such a problem Management has to have been aware of this Absolutely not acceptable 
106506,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, very old and outdated room I took the classic room please don t It wasn t a star worth The heat couldn t be turned off in the bath room because it was broken It was like a sauna ,No Positive
106507,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Everything was very good, Staff is very cordial location is great rooms are good and the offer I got for less than one hundred euros per night was fantastic 
106508,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, The rooms lacked maintenance and the paint of the ceiling in the one bathroom was peeling off The wood paneling in the hotel is old and full of damage The place is far from Royal The TV service has NO English or Portuguese even though these are mentioned in the TV guide provided by the hotel When I asked about this they were very indignant and brushed it off The house keeping staff and service staff enter the rooms without knocking this was rather irritating and bloody rude I was sleeping and they just walked into the room , Location was correct rooms are big and spacious Towels and products provided are good Hair dryer in our worked but was damaged 
106509,Royal Garden Champs Elysees,No Negative, The staff are very friendly The hotel is located within 10 minute walk of the Arc de Triomphe where the Champs Elysees starts The hotel kept our luggage for six hours after we checked out The internet connection was not working properly when I complained to the reception staff they provided me with a portable router which I could take outside with me 
106510,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, There were several things lacking No refrigerator no microwave claimed to have internet but never worked even after contacting the front desk Room was nice and clean but pretty small They show many beautiful rooms on the internet but our room wasn t even half as nice as the pictured rooms , For the price the hotel was excellent 
106511,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, The kitchen facilities in our apartment were dreadful and totally inadequate for the number of people staying in the room At least one knife fork spoon and plate per person would be useful , Breakfast was fabulous All staff were superb 
106512,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, This hotel is a total dump The lobby was okay gave us hope after navigating the tiny garage but our room was so old broken down there was no heat and it was loud , The staff were the only good part about our stay
106513,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Room was dirty and looked like it was still under construction Couldn t get the refrigerator to work Also it said free parking but then we were charged for parking , The staff was very welcoming and nice It was in a great location to have access to many sites around as well as the metro 
106514,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Hotel couldn t give me the room I booked and charged me extra for an upgrade I didn t need No English TV channels not even CNN All channels are French The carpets in the hallways to the rooms could so with some updating or perhaps an airfreshner may help as well , The staff are excellent Very friendly and helpful Location is quite central even though there s not much of a view 
106515,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, They only serve breakfast room service was very limited , The location of the hotel is great Breakfast is the best I had in France so far I stayed in 4 different hotels Very helpful staff
106516,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, More items in the kitchen would be helpful , The location right near Champs lys e was ideal for the entire city There were two convenient metro stations nearby and bus stops Very close to Arc De Triomphe We had an apartment for the family of 4 The kitchen is not equipped to cook a meal just simple breakfast or snack The bathroom was nice as well except that the hairdryer mounted on the wall didn t work but they loaned me another one 
106517,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Broken bathroom door lock waited them to fix and they could not Left it dirty Poor wifi broken safe and hairdryer Dirty bathrobe and hair in bath Shabby bathroom Double bed was two pushed together , Lovely breakfast and very helpful staff Quiet location short walk to the metro 
106518,Royal Garden Champs Elysees,No Negative, The hotel has a spectacular location close to Champs Elysses and other sightseens There were no problems with staying with a dog The quality of food in room service was good for reasonable price

106520,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Internet free wifi was not usable once in the rooms breakfast was expensive if you wanted it Leaking bathroom fixtures made for interesting showers , Room was a little run down and old for a 4 star hotel however nothing terrible The beds were comfortable and the room spacious Location was amazing right in the heart of Paris 
106521,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, We had to wait over 40 minutes for our room to be assigned when we got there Once we were finally there the air conditioner didn t work phone didn t work WiFi didn t work Beds were noisy and walls definitely too thin , Location was OK 
106522,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Cold room No soundproof room heavy blanket bed moved easily which was not good hard to control a water basin s tap if i turned on hot water just little bit it was already very very hot , The hotel was close to the the Arc de Triomphe and nice staffs 
106523,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, The lobby area gives a nice impression and the breakfast room is welcoming quiet and relaxing But that s where it ends The room we had was quite poor badly painted terrible curtains that also couldn t be easily reached Noisy fan at night WIFI is very poor in most parts of the hotel although they do load a 4G dongle that works well , the location is great easy walk to various sights to the river and at this time of year the Xmas market Staff are also open friendly and do their best 
106524,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Poor wifi connection, Location Size of room Wardrobe mirrors Good bathroom Polite and helpful staff Cleaned daily with fresh towels Little noise
106525,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Tired hotel in need of an upgrade Saying it has free Wifi is ambitious 3 days stay I think I managed access for a total of 40 minutes , Staff were lovely location is excellent 
106526,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, I booked this hotel especially because it said on the website it had a shuttle Well it turns out that there is no shuttle but they arrange transfer for 55 euros to CDG equivalent to a taxi if you book 24h in advance , Location is great
106527,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Nothing, The whole experience was fantastic Excellent location Service etc I highly recommend and will be back I have recommended to Al my friends also

106529,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, First day first room very poor just a bed and tv no balcony the second room ugliest and dirty the second had a terrace sea full of mold cockroaches and spiders room dirty floor unwashed smell bad I spoke to the receptionist but he told me that I have to stay in that room until the next day I resisted until 12 at night I felt sick I could not breathe my tongue numb and feeling faint had to go there in another room or another hotel receptionist gave me another room better it had air conditioner so better on another day the staff from cleaning forgot to pass on my room to 5 30 pm Another day one of the staff originally from Sry Lanka with a gentleness invited me to go out with him for a coffee or a drink another staff asked me if i have to give him a cigarette when i left the hotel the receptionist said if i want taxi i have to pay 35 euro or the taxi it was 12 euro, good location

106533,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, This was suppose to be a 4 star first of all it was very old and under construction and it was not indicated the facility nothing was working every single person was staying there was complaining it was not worth the money at all it is more like a one star hotel , just a location was convenient 
106534,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, When I arrive I drop my league to by my self because the recipitist tell me we don t have some one to carry Then I discovered she lay Breakfast is very bad and poor Beds are hard and not comfortable and broke on my son Air conditioning is not working and leaking water from ceiling and no one to fix just tell me tomorrow they will fix every thing but until I leave nothing fixed, Nothing
106535,Royal Garden Champs Elysees,No Negative, This is a nice hotel It s got all you need and the staff are very helpful It s not a glamorous fancy establishment but it has lots of space and the rooms are either quote big or with a terrace The breakfast are is nice and the staff are really lovely who serve the breakfast It s really clean I really like to stay here 
106536,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, The rooms were grubby and worn in places One of the rooms did not have a hairdryer or tea coffee making facilities French doors in one room opened to a sheer drop with no safety barrier Access to the car park was very tight and not suitable for low profile cars We grounded one of our vehicles entering the car park , Close location to the Champs Elysees and Arc De Triomphe We booked three rooms and they were clean Secure parking Staff were polite and helpful 
106537,Royal Garden Champs Elysees,No Negative, The staff was great I had problems connecting to the hotel wi fi network so they provided me my own personal mini router so I not only enjoyed my stay as well as the great location but also managed to work 
106538,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, The beds were so squeaky that they woke us up at night every time we moved The wifi wasn t great we were given a booster for our room but it still wasn t great , Staff was very friendly and helpful even helped guide us down into the very tight garage 
106539,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, The service at reception was very poor wifi didn t connect properly and the reception man was very rude and not happy yo offer friendly good customer service The lightin my bathroom kept flashing , Bed was very tiny and no comfort at all
106540,Royal Garden Champs Elysees,No Negative, The staff were exceptional I had a large international party of friends and family over for a celebration and they all mentioned how great the staff were and how clean their apartments were It was the first time we d stayed in that part of Paris the hotel is well situated and has a beautiful park around the corner perfect for our picnic I highly recommend Royal Garden as price wise it s also very reasonable for the facilities and service provided I d certainly stay here again 
106541,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, please don t waste your money trust me you will be very disappointed horrible staff especially women at reception no facilities in room god nose how they got 4 stars very dated hotel need a lot doing its more like a bnb definitely not worth the money I feel like I was robbed, very good location
106542,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, The entrance of the hotel could do with some cosmetic repair but it is only a detail , Having read some reviews I was extremely worried about the hotel and the room but I was pleasantly surprised The executive room was very nice The bed was comfy and the bathroom was ok I could see the Eiffel Tower from my bedroom and had a small balcony The wifi worked very well The staff were very helpful and polite I did not eat there so could not comment on the food 5 minutes away from the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees 
106543,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Do not stay at this hotel The photos are completely misleading and it s not at all worth paying for The room we were given was completely outdated and disgusting Flooring was damaged panel under sink was coming off the wall and was very dirty smell of smoke throughout corridor COMPLETELY NOT SOUNDPROOF I could hear the rooms next to me as well as above me very clearly and barely slept a wink after a very long journey View from window was of broken trellis and below balcony which has rubbish on it including a dirty spoon Overall a very disappointing experience I would categorically never stay here again and would advise no one else to either , Staff were pleasant but clearly weren t proud of the quality of room service they were providing 
106544,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Our room was fine but the decor was worn There was nothing provided in the tiny kitchen but you could request utensils etc if you wanted Our kids shared the two bedrooms and we were on the sofa bed which was fine but not ideal comfortable for longer than a weekend The staff were courteous and helpful but not overly friendly , The location was excellent Walking distance to the Champs Elysees and nice restaurants The hotel was bright and clean but in need of renovation everywhere They had great coffee making facilities in the room and nice bath products though 
106545,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, 20 euros for parking night wasn t aware as thought it was already included in the price Asked for a double bed got two joined twin beds which were moving off in different directions Construction noise coming from the other side of the street from early morning hours , good location good size executive room clean wifi
106546,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Lack of basic facilities in the suite kitchen had a microwave dishwasher and hob but no crockery cutlery utensils or cooking equipment Electrics were hit and miss some plug sockets worked but others didn t Plumbing similar story one tap didn t work no plugs for sinks and bath plug didn t fit Wifi was very temperamental , Very spacious suite lots of room and storage Great balconies Friendly staff and great location Beds comfy and clean 
106547,Royal Garden Champs Elysees,No Negative, Great and extremely helpful personal very good and delicious breakfast clean service fast internet I would definitely recommend this hotel Thanks one more time to all workers of the hotel 
106548,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Standard of room average very tired looking and not of four star quality Attempted to connect to hotel Wi Fi without success Toilet appeared to have unpleasant odour the shower bath was very slow to drain so that you would be up to your ankles in water when showering When checking in were advised that breakfast was not included it actually was and was confirmed by this website at the time of booking hotel relented once challenged but a regrettable start to our stay , Close to the Arc de Triomphe and within reasonable walking distance of Charles de Gaulle toile Metro station Staff generally friendly especially those at breakfast who did appear make an effort to make us feel welcome 
106549,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, The property was below what the website has shown it was very poor facilities poor room equipment and certainly not 4 stars the bed moved a lot and made a lot of noise the heater was working and would t get switched off the bathroom sometimes had no warm water only very hot burning water I was shocked to know upon arrival that there was no room service and no mini bar the door was normally locked and I couldn t open it with the room card i had to call someone from the reception each time to open the door themselves , only the location was good
106550,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, The cocktail bar didn t live up to my expectations but so many great bars near by that didn t matter , What a fantastic location we were there for NYE and it was such a pleasant easy way to join in celebrations in Champs Elysees and enjoy all that Paris has to offer Surrounded by great bars and restaurants close to Metro easy walk to Eiffel Tower Breakfast was excellent staff were very helpful family apartment roomy and comfortable Great value for money 
106551,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, The staff repeatedly exaggerated the closeness to the Eiffel Tower it was no way 20 mins walk still liked walking to the Eiffel Tower with children , The apartment was quite big at least bigger than our anticipation excellent location and a space for parking 
106552,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Rooms require maintenance Looks as if they are saving money in advance of refurbishment, Location good and furnishings of high quality if a little shabby Room was quiet 
106553,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, I dint like the bedroom no light I had a small baby with me the hotel never provided a travel cot The photos shown on Internet are not the same what we find when we get there , I liked ether location the hotel is near by many attractions cafe restaurants and transport 
106554,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Internet in the room is so slow that practically unusable The room is small cold dark Windows in internal yard unpleasant view The good days of this hotel far in the past, Location breakfast is good enough
106555,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, It s a very average hotel with not very clean and not renovated facilities Internet connection is 50kb per second very slow Sound isolation is very poor I could hear everything in the corridor and next rooms Bathroom was dirty with mold and calc Not all power plugs were working in my room Bed has a very basic matrass , Location is the only thing that I liked about this hotel 
106556,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Teribble experience needed a twin room which they didn t provide until night 2 Toilet was blocked 3 people came to fix it and when getting to the Room they all turned around and refused to do anything because they don t do toilets and they charged me for 2 rooms which I am still trying to get a refund for, Not much
106557,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, No wifi at all even though stated free wifi throughout the hotel No hairdryer rang to request from reception twice and it never arrived Asked reception to ring a taxi had to ask twice before it was ordered for some reason waited 30 minutes and it never arrived , Excellent breakfast good location good value for Paris Main receptionist was very courteous 
106558,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Where to begin the other receptionist was horrendous she was rude unhelpful and did not care the advert stated there was a room safe there was none the wifi did not work when I asked the above receptionist she did not care and just said there was nothing she could do Room and bed was from the 70 s uncomfortable, One receptionist was very helpful 
106559,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Hotel Room is old and dirty Staff was not friendly The wifi password did not work and the staff acted like I did it wrong turns out the wifi password expired and they didn t even say sorry , Only the location was decent
106560,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Old furniture Old bathroom fittings they claim having Internet which is not true You can never access it and I had to buy my own 3G Modem to get internet access in the hotel Very few varieties for breakfast , It has a good location the room space is good 
106561,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, I booked a twin room depending on the furniture on the pictures However what I got is really different old furniture the room I booked is sounds proof but what I got is really bad its like staying in a hustle I could hear the next room talking and using the toilet the air condition isn t working the internet is really slow and sometimes doesn t work I asked for a tissue and they told me they are out of stock 4 stars hotel and they answered me like this 2 days later they knocked on my door and they give me a tissue they brought it from another room The business centre has only one computer and really slow overall I don t know how this hotel got 4 stars , Location Only 
106562,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, Do not stay in this hotel This hotel is the worst hotel I ever been Totally ruin it my trip in Paris No internet for the first day slow wifi that I can t work during my trip I ve told them many times and they don t fix it the service is terrible with really bad attitude Our dryer was broken and have strange noise We are fighting with the service every day and night and no one will help you This hotel does not worth any ,No Positive

106566,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, This is not a 4 star hotel More a 3 Quite old and needs renovating Cracks chips and run down in places The toilet was very small but bathroom was large Wifi was free but slow didnt work But for a short 1 2 night stay for those not wanting to spend a lot this is good especially for the location , I stayed here for 1 night Great value for money Good location 10 15 euros in a taxi to Eiffel Tower eurostar station Staff helpful and polite but didn t really give much information about the area no concierge Stayed in the 2 bed apartment which was clean very large and comfortable Hot shower Big beds Breakfast was good for price paid 
106567,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, I didn t find my reservation as I did it the reserved apartment with fan not AC I took about 3 hrs to check in even I arrived 10 pm The reception employee was non cooperative and can t solve any problem the case was solved by my suggestion to give me 2 rooms instead of the apartment but one only was with AC and the other with fan so I am totally disappointed and never tell any one about this bad hotel, I liked the location only
106568,Royal Garden Champs Elysees, We only stayed one night in the two bedroom family room to celebrate Bastille Day before heading to Disneyland however it was very outdated and desperately in need of renovation There were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room There was a decent sized kitchen with dishwasher but no crockery or cutlery Air conditioning wasn t working in all rooms Main bedroom had a glass bay window into lounge room there was no curtain or blind for privacy , Comfortable but not 4 star quality Location was good and checkout at 12 noon was great as we were out late celebrating Bastille Day and were able to sleep in a little later
