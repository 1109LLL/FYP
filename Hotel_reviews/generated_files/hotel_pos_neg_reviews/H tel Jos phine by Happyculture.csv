230360,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture,No Negative, Staff was super friendly and helpful Also free wine tasting at their partner hotel across the street and free absinthe every night from 6 8 pm The hotel was so comfortable and chic with great restaurants within walking distance About 1 2 miles from tourist destinations but the walk is very easy and enjoyable 
230361,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Air conditioning was not working Also had problems with accepting my bank cards but we managed all issues with smile , This is cozy small hotel The location is very good as it is close to the metro station and it is very easy to navigate in the rue Blanche Despite the location is close to the Mulen Rouge and rue de Clichy it was quiet safe My room was small but very clean and nicely decorated Very nice and pleasant staff ready to solve your small problems in a very polite and agreeable manner Big thanks for additional cooler to my room I was staying probably the hottest night this summer and of course old building and old systems are not ready to cope with this heat Reception managed me a cooler to the room so I was lucky enough and had good sleep Big plus of Happyculture chain free of charge coffee and water in the lobby This already 3rd hotel of the chain I am staying I like it 
230362,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, We had a room 306 May 12 14 The cleaning wasn t great , Many thanks to the lady at reseption who did our check out yesterday morning 14 05 Everything was great 
230363,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Lighting in our room had dark areas We couldn t understand how to work the coffee maker in the room , All staff were exceptionally welcoming and helpful We also loved the quirky but attractive accommodation 
230364,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, This is a small hotel so doesn t have too many staff Not all staff spoke english either so I had to wait to check in for an english speaking member of staff I waited for close to an hour after being told I could check in at 2pm It was a little frustrating after a morning of travel Staff were eager to please but don t expect the exceptional service you might get from a bit chain I guess that is why you choose this place Lots of character fabulous location and very easy to access and all the perks of a small boutique hotel Just misses that polish you get from some very well oiled hotels I d stay there again namely for the location and proximity to everything ,No Positive
230365,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, The toilet seat was not clean A small portable mirror in daylight would have been nice for the lady the light in the bathrooom and in the whoel room is just too dark and there could be a little bit more closet space, breakfast was nice whole interior design was very nice rooms were very quiet no street noise was noticable
230366,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, I was told there s no room for me after confirmed my resevation a day before Even you have my contact no email no phonecall nothing How would you like if you travel one hours train and half hour taxi only want to rest and when you arrive your hotel no room Are you just expecting me enjoy the way you welcome and enjoy your happy culture Thank you for paying a taxi to take me to another hotel but this wont make me comfortable anymore Hope you can do better ,No Positive
230367,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Tiny bathroom very small Some works going on on the hall to the rooms Definitly this is not a 4 star hotel , Breakfast and comfortable beds Nice staff Excelent location considering our purpose Molin Rouge show 
230368,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, The breakfast was standard for the money And my neighbours were smashing their doors , The location is perfect quiet and central The staff is really friendly The rooms are lovely and clean There are supermarkets nearby and lot of boulangeries In this hotel your experience in Paris will be greater 
230369,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Cannot think of anything if there was I would say, Comfortable stay nice lounge area staff lovely the lady at breakfast time chat and helpful loved it all
230370,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture,No Negative, My son was sick in Paris I was in Australia and I found this hotel on the internet at an hour notice The lovely receptionist found a doctor during a public holiday had the doctor at the hotel within an hour of him arriving I couldn t rate this hotel any higher for caring 
230371,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, The location wasn t great on the backstreets of moulin rouge you were kept awake all night by the constant whistling of the women in the building facing Rooms were tiny and even though we booked a twin room only a double bed was provided and even though it was only 5 in the afternoon we were told all the waiting staff had went home so we had to do this ourself We asked for extra bedding 6 times and only on the 6th time did they actually bring us it , The hotel itself was quite nice the staff seemed perplexed at a lot of the basic questions we asked Where to go shopping what metro to get to famous sites ect 
230372,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, No aircondition well sure there is a panel but does not work we averaged a 25 5C temperature in our room No minibar Plastic carpets in the whole room Soundproofed rooms What a laugh never been in a louder hotel room 4 star hotel Try 2 at best , Location is great for Theaters Concert venues etc 
230373,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture,No Negative, We loved H tel Jos phine Far from a cookie cutter hotel this unique little haven was a joy to stay in Everything you need is there with comfort cleanliness helpful staff and all with a lashing of imagination and beautiful boutique style It is also in an excellent location for transport Pigalle Metro is only a few minutes walk 
230374,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Did not like being put in a room where the air conditioning did not work especially since it was so hot and humid out They did move us once we complained Another couple travelling with us had the exact same experience , The young woman at the front desk was the best aspect of Hotel Josephine She was extremely friendly and helpful 
230375,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, the air con was struggling with a very hot July, funky rooms lovely staff small so felt very friendly good location close to the tube and some decent places to eat locally and just a short walk to rue des Martyrs where we discovered the best ice cream shop in Paris Glaces Glazed 
230376,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Air con not working but fan provided Work was being done and would start very early in the morning , Staff were very friendly and eager to help It s right next to the moulin rouge if you are seeing a show it s very handy Lovely decor 
230377,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture,No Negative, staff was very helpful we had a great time and could travel late at nite and not be afraid to walk back alone as it was close by to the metro we were 3 women 
230378,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Some areas were a little shabby and could needed redecoration Room especially the bathroom was very small but adequate Corridors were very narrow and smelt quite stale The exterior of the building was covered in scaffolding so obviously they are starting with the modernisation I feel they should have started with the inside rather than the outside , Very different very french Comfortable bed and lovely breakfast both hot and cold food Staff were very pleasant and helpful Liked the happy hour with free drinks in the evening 
230379,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Scaffolding on the hotel when we visited additional taxes that we weren t overly aware of when we booked, Good location friendly and helpful staff decent breakfast
230380,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Room is too small Wifi connection poor Works outside the building which you can see people walking right outside your window Room is bit cold even though had a electric heater, Five mins walk to Lafayette and 2 mins to moulin rouge good location hot and power shower
230381,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, You can see that it just passed as a 4 star hotel Okay 4 star good 3 star hotel I could hear construction and people above me , Staff friendly check in was quick Overall okay 
230382,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Better to have a real Coffee machine in the room, The staff are very Friendly and the room are very clean The location is great near to the metro station Place de Clichy and the rooms are very quiet I like this position 
230383,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Staff could not have been more helpful breakfast was great location excellent and good value for money as travelling with two teenage boys and mother in law we needed three rooms so it soon becomes dear We had a double and two connecting family rooms it was great ,No Positive
230384,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Scaffolding up outside hotel Staff told us they were painting but woken up at 9 00 by workmen hammering and walking past window on scaffolding Had to shut curtains when they on balcony chipping away at concrete Shame , lovely hotel with character
230385,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Very small room The hotel is renovated but not entirely through my room door you could see the aisle the heating system is incredibly old etc Breakfast is very poor with the exception of the freshly squeezed orange juice , Friendly staff and modern bathrooms Not bad for Paris 
230386,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Building work woke us up on 3 of our 4 mornings Scaffolding right outside the window with workers walking along mean lack of privacy , Breakfast was great Proximity to metro also great 
230387,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Nothing , Staff friendly and helpful Breakfast excellent Free coffee was welcome Decor was quirky and fun The atmosphere was welcoming and very pleasant I would happily return 
230388,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, The bed is really hard SUPER LOUD if you are facing the street I woke up every hour The room is very worn paint chipping on the walls everywhere shower leaking ceiling pealing etc , The lobby is beautiful Staff really friendly 
230389,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Only downside was there was obviously some maintenance work going on as scaffolding was being put up from very early every day , The hotel was fab felt quite safe as a solo female traveller Rooms were compact but clean with comfy large beds Also well equipped with hairdryer coffee machine safe etc Staff were all really helpful and friendly would definitely recommend staying at this hotel 
230390,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture,No Negative, Most helpful friendly staff Monica and Rafaelle were a warm smile on a cold and wet day on our arrival The hair dryer that was found for our daughter s wet hair without request by reception after arriving early from the airport to drop our bags was indicative of the staff intention to go above and beyond Excellent Breakfast Vibey Location short walk from transport services and Moulin Rouge 
230391,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture,No Negative, Very friendly staff great location Room was clean and everything worked Great all around French hotel 2 blocks from the Moulin Rouge and Blanche Metro stop 
230392,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Small room Very small toilet No room in bathroom or by the sink for toothbrush cosmetics etc very hot in room central heating on 24 hours without the possibility to turn it off or set it differently, Great location Lovely staff Good breakfast Nice happy hour All very gentle and generous 
230393,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, The walls are thin so you can hear other guests if they are loud , Location is brilliant Right near Moulin Rouge and excellent travel links The room was huge and the staff were very helpful They also have a serve yourself bar and free cocktails between 6pm and 8pm which was pretty unique 
230394,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture,No Negative, The staff is professional and helpful The room is comfortable and well decorated I really enjoy the fresh orange juice in the breakfast and coffee in the mini bar everyday 
230395,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, As usual in Paris rooms are pretty small The staff at reception was not the most professional one both during the night of my arrival and the morning of my departure , Modern clean and comfortable Breakfast includes freshly squezzed orange juice that made my day 
230396,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Room was insufferably hot AC totally ineffective even in November with rads off Room has no shower although has a deep bath , good location good breakfast helpful staff 
230397,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, The two connecting rooms were both very small I guess this is Paris but still , 1 Breakfast was unexpectedly good unexpectedly goes to say that in such category hotels you get a decent breakfast but you don t expect wonders Without wanting to overstate things this was really a good to very good breakfast proposition Important parameter you can press your own fresh orange juice That to me speaks volumes a you don t get this even in some higher rated hotels 2 Bathrooms were recently renovated and are at a very good standard better than the rest of the room 3 Staff were very helpful when we needed to call a doctor for our daughter they called themselves as it was impossible for us to go over the phone through the french menu of SOS Medecin Doctors SOS and ask for a doctor to come to the hotel Thank you gents 
230398,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, The wifi is a real pain one of the worst I ever experienced complicated to log in having to re log in again and again irregular frequently cutting It s unbelievable that they don t fix it If you need wifi for work pass your way this isn t your place , Good location between Montmartre and St Lazare Bus stop right in front of the hotel Good breakfast for the price fresh orange for juice fresh fruits different yoghurts varieties of tea and pastries cheese and ham eggs and sausages cereals etc Good restaurants nearby Very kind and professional personal 
230399,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, The bar in the lobby You can help yourselves to drinks which is a lovely idea but the prices are twice the price of a bar where they would be serving you the drink No water at this bar that was complimentary even though Tap water is drinkable I had to drink from at tap in the toilet to take some medication Or go all the way back to my room Not such a bad thing but it Just annoyed me , The decor of the hotel and rooms The location was perfect for us Our AC didn t work and we were visiting in the heatwave they gave us a different room and it was all good The main receptionist was brilliant and very helpful 
230400,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture, Although room was big there was a distinct lack of shelving or storage for clothes Wifi was extremely slow to the point of being unusable , Good location near to Monmartre and the Blanche Metro so easy to get anywhere in the city Room was a really good size with aircon Breakfast was good value when paid for at the hotel 
230401,H tel Jos phine by Happyculture,No Negative, Great hotel in great location less than 5 minutes from Blanche Metro around 20 from Gare du Nord Staff were super friendly breakfast good value for money free absynthe cocktail was a bonus Would 100 recommend a 100 go back We had a top floor room bed v comfy all really clean The complementary bathroom bits were also ace
