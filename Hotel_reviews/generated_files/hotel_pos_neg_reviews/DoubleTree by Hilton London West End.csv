261077,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The room that I booked turned out to be horrible and I insisted on a transfer After some haggling I agreed to pay ten British pounds more for a better room The bed in that room was awful I couldn t believe I was going to complain again but I did the alternative was to pay the one night room cost and move to a better hotel The staff graciously moved me to a better room and told me they even added a pilot option so I would be more comfortable , It was a full breakfast and good value
261078,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, A few cobwebs in the room , Friendly staff breakfast was lovely Location was brilliant with just a 15min walk into Covent Garden perfect location for a night at the theatre 
261079,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Very small wardrobe and little space in my first room for couple of days OK but for 2 weeks uncomfortable Fortunately I changed this room soon , I stayed at this hotel 14nights and I really appreciate comfortable king size bed quite corridor polite and very helpful staff receptionists especially Nina and young receptionist man from Italy sorry I do not remember his name tasty breakfast and friendly staff in the restaurant
261080,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Small bathrooms and small elevators A little bit too expensive for the size of the rooms and bathrooms but I guess that is London for you , The breakfast was excellent Rooms were cozy but a little small The bathrooms were the smallest I have ever seen 
261081,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Rooms need to be upgraded Old bathrooms Pillows were useless The 2 bedroom apartment has very steep stairs which is a safety issue for young children or elderly people The apartment roller shutters couldn t close so expect 4am sunlight right in your face , Location was good
261082,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The room was quite small and dark and smelled a little bit musty I think the hotel is a bit over priced for what it offers, The hotel is reasonably well placed close to Holborn tube station There are quite a few restaurants nearby The breakfast was good 
261083,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Hotel was good but just to comment some minor problems It was supposed to be double bed but we got two beds together Except connection between them very comfortable and big Shower bulkhead too small Water was spilled all the time , Good location If you like to walk it is 35 minutes walk from all of the main atractions in the center of London and 200 m from British Museum Furthermore 5 minutes walk to metro and bus We were in a deluxe room big and comfortable Delicious chocolate cookies 
261084,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Small room very low ceiling claustrophobic room view to a outdoor staircase no sky like being in a submarine but we were not even in the basement Very low value for a very high price most skimpy 4 stars hotel we ever visited ,No Positive

261086,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The room was tiny double bed pushed against one wall not enough room for two people to move around bathroom tiny very expensive for room size, Breakfast excellent location superb
261087,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Bearing in mind that this hotel costs over 300 per night including breakfast guests are entitled to expect excellent service and standards The delux room was satisfactory for a hotel of this standard but not exceptional The only extras provided were two small warm bottles of water It was very hot weather Some staff were a bit off hand Breakfast was satisfactory but scrambled eggs cold choice and quality about average No choice of coffees Check in is late at 3pm and we arrived hot and tired at 1pm and could not access our room Again for this quality of hotel this is poor , The hotel is comfortable the reception bar and dining areas are spacious and comfortable The room was reasonably spacious and comfortable The location is good and lively with easy access to the centre of London

261090,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Dinner was ok but service very slow and our choices got confused in translation Not a big deal as what we had was very nice , Room was ok although a bit small two people couldn t pass at any one time Breakfast was very good lots of choice 
261091,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Booked a normal double small and dated with little light and noisy generator next to it so upgraded to a premier room that was 3x the size and much nicer , Upgraded to a premier room much better 
261092,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Room too small and aircon wouldn t cool down , Staff really friendly hotel in a fantastic location Room was really small and too warm Had to ask for clean crockery as they were dirty 
261093,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The lifts are a bit small and there is no fridge in the room The hotel doesn t have a drop off site You will take risk of parking outside of the hotel even for a couple of minutes , Locate at the centre of Holburn

261097,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Nothing like the level of cleanliness renovation fixtures fittings and comfort you would expect at this price point Lift size capacity speed and noise suggesting imminent breakdown Worn paneling in the bathroom no toilet brush Communicating with some staff in English was not so easy , The location is great for the British museum and central London in general The first impression when entering the foyer reception area is positive Friendly staff 
261098,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The bathroom was falling apart The shower didn t work properly and was dirty The basin was loose and the taps for the basin were not attached correctly so when you try to turn them on or off the whole unit turned The room has very little sound proofing and therefore all the noise from the street kept me awake most of the night I definitely felt like I was staying in a cheap 2 or less star hotel and definitly was not a 280 per night room sorry DoubleTree but I felt a little ripped off and would have been better off staying in a travelidge or premier inn instead Don t let guests stay in rooms that are in need of repair and sort the noise levels out in the rooms that are street facing and perhaps the rating would be better consider charging a more reasonable price for a standard room , Great welcome from the reception staff overall cleanliness and location 
261099,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Rooms a bit small but better than many in London and air con ok but not brilliant , Quite close to tube stations and sights of central London Staff always cheery and helpful Lovely old staircase leading to floors but pity they replaced last flight to ground level Rooms reasonably comfortable and decent breakfast

261140,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, I know that hotels in London usually have small rooms But my room was more like a cabin on a small boat They compensated this with an extra small bed I am 6 3 and the both my feet were hanging out of the bed the bed felt more like and extra bed it was very hard and my shoulders streched pretty much all across it one of the windows had a crack all across it and the slightest wind made it slam all night There was abolutely no pressure in the shower so soap and shampoo took forever to get off I mentioned this when checking out but not really any response was given I am sure that they have nice rooms aswell but considering such a price at a in general nice chain this was way under my expectations , Clean hotel in a good location

261160,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Our 2 bedroom suite was boiling hot clearly there was an issue with the thermostat not safe to put two kids in I was shown an identical boiling hot room on the same floor and told that it was my imagination it was not habitable either We were eventually put into a smaller suite with a dirty toilet and stained sheets The management were prompt and polite housekeeping arrived to fix the problem but I was charged the whole full rate and the only compensation was when we checked out I was given the manager s card and ensured an upgrade next time No thanks , It is in a very good central location with access to a secure and fairly reasonable car park Bloomsbury placed and Holborn Tube both a 2 minute walk from the hotel

261172,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Bedroom fitted cabinets were battered and the door to the mini bar door was hanging loose but re hung quickly when reported however The room was cramped and the layout not so good but I d guess this is a function of the original building, Sandra on duty at breakfasts was most helpful and friendly and even remembered our names
261173,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, I paid extra for a deluxe suit but I found it could have been better the lampshade next to the bed was really stained I also left a message saying it was for a 50th birthday but that was ignored and no fuss made, Lovely hotel friendly staff

261178,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, I was given the room reserved for disabled guests and the room had twin beds which I did not request The carpet near the desk was also soaking wet It was an awful room I didn t take the time to complain as my time was very limited but I am surprised I was allocated this room , The location

261195,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, No bell service room was as big the single bed The space is so tight that I had to walk sideways to get around I can hear the people in the hall as if they were inside the room My college dorm room was bigger I complained and was asked to pay more to get a normal sized room I checked out the next day with a complaint the staff told me that I should have complained to get the room changed and that is what they always do this hotel has a nice lobby but the rooms are more like a 1 star motel For the same price you can stay at nicer 4 star hotels in the area DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME WITH THIS PLACE Just as a mention I was offered breakfast for my complaint and they said they will do more After I accepted the breakfast they told me that they can t do anything because I accepted the breakfast , Lobby was ok

261203,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The room was tiny compared to what it looked like on the pictures there was a lot of things in the room that needed fixing like wholes in the curtains and the ceiling had bubbled and cracked Also the TV didn t work , The location was amazing right near everything we needed for our trip 
261204,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Toileteries not replaced care line on phone didn t work so I called to the desk on my way out thinking it could be done before I got back But I was handed them from a box under the desk and they only had 3 of the 4 , Lovely hotel Nice room and bathoom Chain on door Hot Cookie on arrival Great location Three lifts

261211,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, No parking at the hotel Nearest parking is a few blocks away and at 6 pounds an hour extremely pricey Lucky for us we were planning to ditch the rental car anyway and use buses and the tube which we would highly recommend for anyone coming to stay in the city , The staff were very helpful friendly and professional at all times Response to requests for assistance were immediate Breakfast buffet was exceptional in very way Food in the restaurant was also exceptional Our room was remarkably quiet and although we could have wished for a wee bit more space in our room we know that hotel rooms in BIG cities are usually very compact We also LOVED the central location of this hotel We were ideally situated for the buses and or taking the tube and steps away from a number of fabulous pubs and restaurants a lovely park and even a few major landmarks and museums 
261212,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, No smoking terrace for guests your out side on the pavement I m afraid, Fantastic location bus tour company pick up straight out side the hotel there s also an underground car park across the road which you can receive 50 discount when staying in the Hilton amazing breakfast customer service 100 
261213,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, In view of my like comments I would like to think that all the rooms irrelevant of the style are cleaned to the same standard We will be staying again in October in twin rooms and hope that the visit is as excellent at this time, We have stayed here before in a family room and i wasnt impressed with the cleanliness This time we stayed in an executive room and it was so much better no faults at all 
261214,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Not really impressed with the position of the room with all the heating and ventilation plant outside the window Felt the room was cramped for the cost , Great location and really friendly and helpful staff
261215,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The price was a bit over the top for the type of room we got which was a deluxe double but not really deluxe you are paying for the location more than anything also the afternoon tea was quite cheaply made for the price 35 the cakes were just small sponges and not like advertise Sandwiches were very small and scones were dry even with the butter and jam on My wife enjoyed it though so maybe I was just being a bit picky apart from that breakfast was fantastic and plenty of choice I love the table service in the bar area too that was a good touch overall fantastic place just go elsewhere for afternoon tea , Location was great and ideal for most attractions within a short bus ride or walk
261216,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The room was VERY bijou for 288 but I supposed you can argue it s London would I find anywhere else cheaper , Property was very clean staff were really polite the cup of tea which is by far the most important was lovely and a really convenient location 
261217,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Tiny room and 20 cost for breakfast is a bit laughable unless it s golden slices of bacon and serves with diamond beans, The hotel staff could not have been more courteous looking after our stuff before and after our check in out timesome the rooms were tidy and our requests iron and bucket of ice were dealt wit has quickly and politely
261218,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Our bedroom not so big with small slightly shabby bathroom Our kids rooms was nice tho , Bed was very comfy as it was my birthday they sent a bottle of fizz to both our rooms very nice gesture so did pre drinks in room before heading to the theatre Breakfast was very good staff very friendly and helpful

261229,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Tiny tiny bathroom which wasn t as clean as i would have liked but to be honest the cleaner probably couldn t have got inside sufficiently to clean it No room service menu ect in the room , Excellent location one tube ride from kings cross perfect for single mum to take 12 year old to theatre we walked to see Charlie and the chocolate factory and felt safe the whole time We opted out of breakfast to save money and there were lots of cheaper options on our doorstep 
261230,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, We were supposedly upgraded to a better room as it was our Anniversary however the room we were given was quite small and closely resembled a cabin on a cruise ship Made us think what size would our room have been had we not been upgraded , Very helpful staff that made you feel welcome Room service choices were good and of good quality when they arrived Close to a lot of theatre locations in West End 
261231,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Only there one night and spent limited time in hotel as out and about so nothing to dislike , THE LOCATION WAS GREAT AND THE PRICE OF THE ACCOMMODATION IT WAS A GOOD SIZE ROOM FOR THREE ADULTS AND THE BEDS WERE VERY COMFORTABLE

261257,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, We were very shocked that the bar in the hotel was closing at 12 30 on a weekend night we came back after having a nice meal to have a quiet drink before retiring to bed but could only have 1 drink as the bar was closing but our room was lovely and breakfast was very tasty, The staff was very helpful and was always asking us if we needed anything else our original room was not suitable for us because of mine and my friends disabilities so we were offered different rooms of which they showed us first to make sure we were happy
261258,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, we had a couple of staff at the receptionists that weren t helpful whatsoever although having said that the first time we checked in we were greeted by a really friendly receptionist and then we had to check out to go out of london when we returned for the second part of our stay we had a poor reception which was a downer , the location is gold it s so easy to catch the tube or bus to central london

261263,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Staff on my first time checking in was really friendly and I was fortunate to have a slightly larger room on the Hilton HHonors floor and then I checked out to go out of town and came back 2 days later and had a rather impolite receptionist at the desk checking me in Came in early from Brighton and wasn t aware of the late check out time and so we weren t allowed to go to our room and receptionist her name I remember was Luiza was in no way apologetic about the situation but told me flat in the face that room is not available until 3pm such a complete contrast to the first time when I was greeted by a really polite and helpful receptionist by the name of Cristina And of course I didn t realise check out time was 11am and someone from reception actually came up to our room and knocked on the door and said check out time is 11am thank goodness we were packed and ready to leave the room anyways but the receptionist could have perhaps called to our room and told us it would have been less intrusive perhaps , Like that the location is close to central London
261264,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The mattress on the bed was a bit too hard for my liking but my partner loved it so not a real negative overall , In prime location with Covent Garden and shopping within a small walk away plenty of options for food nearby also

261268,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The staff couldn t tell me where to park and ended up driving around London to only find a ridiculous priced car park the room was crammed although clean But we hardly slept due to the traffic outside and childish drivers honking the horns continously , Clean room
261269,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End,No Negative, With so much to do in London we ran out of time so were very happy to discover that when we returned to the hotel at around 10 45pm we were still able to dine in the bar There was a good choice on the menu Our food arrived quickly and we enjoyed it very much Following a great night s sleep breakfast was of the highest standard with a range and quality of food that would be hard to beat Staff in all departments were most welcoming and helpful Ideally situated between King s Cross and Covent Garden this is a hotel that we have visited before and would not hesitate to do so again 
261270,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, We booked a family room that was hardly sized for a family The convertible sofa was a twin size and the room provided almost zero storage My clothes and the children s clothing did not fit anywhere There was not one dresser in the whole family room And there was space for one just under the TV in the sofa area We were forced to live out of our suitcases for an entire week which left our clothes wrinkled and difficult to find , Luisa at the front desk was wonderful to me and my parents and my two small children The tea in the lobby restaurant was lovely The cookies were a nice touch

261279,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Nothing special but if I tell you small thing shower pressure was bit weak , The receptionists were so kind and felt proffesional hospitality It s unusual at London hotel Specially Maria who helped me when checked in was the best receptionist I had ever met She tried to meet my requests as much as possible when I asked her upgrage my room with specil discount rate I was so touched by her hospitality I d like to say thank you to her using this opportunity Other staffs are all helpful and friendly as well I will definitely stay this hotel again

261317,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, I had said when booking the hotel it was our anniversary and feel free to do anything to make Katie s stay special So if we arrived and flowers or chocolates had been left on the bed on our arrival or two glasses of wine to make it feel that little bit special then I would have paid the cost of this but no nothing was done , The bed was absolutely what the doctor ordered after walking around London all day A foot spa would have been perfect

261321,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, There was a problem throughout our stay with the hot water No type of refund or perhaps a dinner voucher was offered We stayed 3 nights 3 out of the four showers I got were ice cold There was a notification on our tv to run the water an extra ten mins but this only catered for one shower Having a massive throat and chest infection at the time the cold showers only prolonged my recovery , The location was superb and the staff especially at the buffet breakfast that greeted us were extremely friendly and helpful

261328,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Room 231 heating air conditioning didn t work at all not at all good for the rateing of the hotel This should be checked before guests arrive I can only presume our room was above kitchen as you could hear quite a bit of noise from below from quite early Desk in room had been turned round as drawers were missing Lights on the right hand side of the bed were hit miss, Location
261329,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Noisy generators directly outside the room window The view from the window of both rooms was disappointing but it did not impact on our overall enjoyment , The staff were so helpful and kind Luisa on reception was amazingly helpful to us as were all staff They couldn t do enough for us

261333,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, No hot water engineer turned up at 6pm on night 2 of 2 Great timing considering most people are out during the day Rooms are tiny Some lifts not working Doors have no acoustic insulation making it very noisy , The bar area is nice

261340,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, We were a little disappointed that there was no cocktails available, The staff within the hotel were there at every opportunity to cater for your needs so happy friendly and helpful The variety and quality of food for breakfast was faultless We also got room service which was presented in no time at all

261344,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, I was VERY dissapointed with the room for the price i payed travelodge rooms are bigger just as comfortable with a bigger bed and they are cheaper if you get what you pay for im going to travelodge next time i stay in London overall feeling of being charged 156 for 1 night and nearly 40 for 2 breakfasts because they could and not because they are special even though they are a Hilton hotel i will NOT stay in any hilton hotels again and i would not recommend them either, The warm friendly welcoming staff and the delicious warm cookies

261396,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Bathroom had mildew in the shower cubical shower draw was broken and when we used the shower there was an awful smell from the drain, Staff were wonderful breakfast was fantastic
261397,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Restaurant serving staff did not seem very well organised or trained Wrong food was brought to my table Took a long time trying to get their attention to order another drink and dessert , Very comfortable Bed very quite 
261398,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Bathroom no selves our toilet bags had to sit on the floor no hot water toilet too near door Sandwiches served in the Bar were tasteless, Room was OK but not worth the money Breakfast was very good 
261399,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, We stayed in a deluxe room After staying in a normal double room in this hotel before I was very disappointed The room was not as impressive as I had hoped and was not worth the 400 I paid for a 2 night stay The room was average size with all the same facilities of any other room the bathroom tiles were cracked in some places and the shower flooded the room every time it was used no matter how careful we were The room it s self was very dull and could use a lick of paint and maybe some colour to make it less depressing Would have preferred to have stayed in a premier inn as the Hilton was not worth the amount of money that I paid for it ,No Positive
261400,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, poor service from reception staff Room service spilt a whole glass of wine in my room and left me to clean it up with a towel from the bathroom Was asked go to reception to put a credit card in to enable me to order room service when I said I was not happy to get dressed had just had a bath and go down to reception to do this they quickly just took the money from the card I had booked the room with so why the fuss about it Not the sort of service I would expect from a Hilton just another mediocre hotel Room very smal with tired decor , Breakfast was good
261401,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Awful room Just by the lift which made a racket all night every time the doors opened Air conditioning didn t work Bed so short I couldn t lie down straight ,No Positive
261402,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Our room therostat did not operate it took 2 days to get it to operate properly The electric shaver point in the bathroom did not work , Very friendly staff Great Choc Cookies 
261403,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, We were less than 12h at the hotel The room and toilet were rather small and there was dust when we closed the curtains , Friendly staff Very good welcome cooking Breakfast was rather decent 
261404,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Our room was a double but a little small one side was against the wall which was awkward getting in and out for the poor person who got that side of the bed my husband lol , We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis which proved a good choice as the breakfast was really good All the staff we friendly and helpful from the cleaning staff waiting staff and reception Walking distance from Euston station and the theatre 
261405,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The fact that I had to call the reception every time I had to get into my room as the key card didnt always work That s quite frustratiing after a long work day , The room was warm clean and comfortable
261406,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Nothing if being picky bar service was a little slow, Staff very welcoming even brought cake to our room for my daughter s birthday Lovely touch Will definitely stay again 
261407,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, We were a little disappointed with the room as it was quite small We had booked a deluxe double and cannot see that we got what we ordered We are not sure of the difference and didn t query this as the room was only being used as a base for 1 night but if we had booked a longer stay we would have been very disappointed , Staff were very helpful Location was good and facilities good also 
261408,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Ran out of my favourite drink at the bar Amaretto very minor point though , Excellent clean accommodation Friendly staff very pleasant experience 
261409,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The housekeeping staff was slow to clean the room one day it didn t get cleaned until after 5 30 in the afternoon , The location could not have been better for us 
261410,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The double room I booked was smaller expected based on previous visits almost a single with a double bed fitted it to the same space The price was also some 50 60 more I don t know why , The location is ideal for my needs Easy walking distance from restaurants and transport connections
261411,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The room seemed smaller than the stated size No drawer space and overall the decor and furniture was more tired than I expected v the price paid , Breakfast was excellent All staff polite and helpful 
261412,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Bland and business like no wow factor and staff although efficient are not very engaging , We were pleased with the location and the fact that they acknowledged our anniversary with a card some bubbly and cake The hotel was clean 
261413,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Initial room offered was too small and not what I would call a double deluxe but after speaking to receptionist she moved us very quickly without any problem ,No Positive
261414,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Our experience was spoilt by the room temperature The room thermostat was turned to its lowest level of 17 c But the air conditioning was not ever reaching the desired temperature For 2 nights me and my wife didn t sleep so ultimately spoilt our stay as we were tired throughout the day We requested a fan which was supplied to us which worked for a short period until it was generally blowing the warm air around the room Very uncomfortable 2 days stay Were not usually ones to complain but the room temperature spoilt our mini vacation ,No Positive
261415,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Discretionary 12 5 service charge, The staff were exceptionally helpful when we asked for a better room than the one that had been allocated to us and we weren t charged for the upgrade
261416,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, We decided to upgrade from a double to deluxe double and were severely disappointed Not only was the deluxe room one of the smallest we ve stayed at in this country it was also unclean There were 2 quite big coffee I hope it was anyway stains on the carpet and bath sealant missing mouldy We complained to reception and were told they could not move us because the hotel was full After much negotiation they finally knocked some money off but the size of the room for a Hilton was small , Henri at reception was polite helpful Breakfast was good 
261417,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The rooms our old and dated with stained carpeting There was only one hook to hang our wet towels after a shower concierge booked a trip to stone henge for us and the bus ended up dumping us off on the other side of the city where we had to pay 25 Euro to get back to our hotel I complained to the concierge and they said someone would contact me It has been almost a month and no one has , The staff was friendly and helpful The lobby was very nice and updated I also liked the location as it is walking distance to Starbucks and the British Museum
261418,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, We didn t get rooms together on the same floor Rooms weren t ready till check in I know that s the policy but I have been in some hotels that will have them ready early , Our executive room was excellent Liked the free apple service Breakfast 
261419,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Staff did not know the area when we asked questions which bus to take were to eat etc when checking out i was not asked if our stay was ok or did we have any problems just took my money and said good bye never once asked if we were happy with everything, Location room
261420,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, We booked three deluxe doubles one of which was half the size of the other rooms this was a small double at best with a faulty door lock no fridge and a safe that didn t work we are very disappointed with the room , The location was great as was the breakfast
261421,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Paid for a upgrade ended up with a noisy next to busy thoroughfare room with broken air conditioning, Staff were friendly and helpful location was good
261422,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, I have no complains at all , Staff were very friendly and helpful The room and hotel were great They were both very clean and tidy at all times I would and have reccommended 
261423,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, I had a poor experience at check in I was not told where breakfast would be served or where the gym was On check out there was a complication on gaining a receipt for room service This took 3 weeks to be resolved , The location was excellent near plenty of good restaurant and very close to many of London s attractions My stay was very comfortable and the room and hotel was spotless In general staff where polite 
261424,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, My toilet kept blocking up and service was slow to fix it It was not resolved properly during my stay , Bed was comfortable and the breakfasts were lovely The location was brilliant 
261425,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Rooms could use a refurbish especially the bathroom had some mold wear and tear marks , Great staff especially very helpful receptionist Pantelis doing his best to accommodate our needs Nice room and good size for London standards Great location close to the tube and city center 
261426,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Room condition Very small with a double bed pushed up to the wall Decor required attention Curtains would not close and hung off the window needed hooks and putting on runners Windows require attention seals This would also reduce room noise, Front of house staff helpful
261427,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The lifts were very small and we struggled to fit two of us and a bag in The shower just dribbled out which was a little frustrating , The reception staff on arrival were excellent The beds were amazingly comfortable Check out process was very easy 
261428,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The room is very small for the price Bathroom is also small I don t know what s London hotels are like but for a four star hotel I expect everything to be provided There are no bedroom slippers no bathrobes no toothbrush and no toothpaste The shower screen doesn t prevent floors from flooding , I like that the staff were friendly and helpful It s also in the middle of two tube stations The cookies given were warm and delicious Beds and pillows were comfortable Soaps and shampoos provided were great albeit small in amount 
261429,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The rooms are a little cramped and can develop a bit of a dank smell if the air conditioning is turned off for long The wi fi seems to break down quite often , The location is great within a short walk of the British Museum and the theatre district 
261430,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Lower ground room meant below ground so a concrete wall immediately outside the window Zero view and quite claustrophobic Smell of drains not pleasant either Could hear tube trains from the room but not enough to reply disturb , Clean Good location for West end and Covent Garden Short walk to Holborn tube
261431,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End,No Negative, very clean brilliant location for exploring centre of London no more than 20 mins from anything Excellent service Had a problem with a shirt not being returned from Laundry in time for Afternoon tea at the Ritz Hotel not only arranged but also paid for another shirt to be brought to my room Great service 
261432,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Really small rooms and the shower has terrible water pressure which makes it difficult to wash long hair , The staff was very friendly and the lobby bar is comfortable to work and relax Location of the hotel is fine 
261433,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, We have stayed at this hotel several times and always been very pleased but on this occasion it was a complete disaster We paid for an upgraded Deluxe Double Room with a bath and asked for a ground floor room if possible We were told on arrival that we were to have a further complimentary upgrade but were then put in a horrible attic room with no bath The glass shower door was off its runners and fell on me while in the shower very dangerous There was mould in the shower and no slip mat The air conditioning did not work properly There was no hot water on the first evening The chambermaid forgot to clean the room and after two complaints we only got access to it at 4 45 pm on the second day One of the receptionists spoke very little English so communication was nearly impossible The bar ran out of gin I pursued all of my complaints on Checkout and was given a credit for one night s bar bill I get the impression that the problem is bad overall management of what is essentially a good hotel , Ambiance and location very good Food excellent 
261434,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The pillows were feather and as a Agatha suffer I ended up with a bad chest The quilts were double bed size double over on a single bed which made them to heavy and to hot, The staff were lovely
261435,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End,No Negative, Work was being carried out in the room next door very noisy When we mentioned it to the front desk we were immediately moved to an upgraded room Service without question excellent 
261436,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, I liked it all No issues , The staff were ever so friendly The hotel was just great i had no issues with any of it Very clean very comfortable too Would definitely come again and would recommend to anyone 
261437,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Room was supposed to be available from 3pm but not ready when arriving at 3 30pm We had to wait until 5 30pm 2 hours eventhough we told reception we had a theatre booking we needed to get ready for which was at 7pm very rushed to get ready and not relaxing at all Shower wasn t very good Double bed was two singles put together which was uncomfortable No late check out availability eventhough we weren t allowed into our room until 5 30pm we even requested this a week or so before on booking com so felt this wasn t good enough In the morning we had a 9am knock on the door which woke us up to check if we had left already or not so cleaners could clean the room we didn t have to be out of our room until 11am again felt rushed out of our room , Good location Nice hotel reception Nice looking room 
261438,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Extremely noisy as it is in a main road 2 mornings we had no hot water for a shower They forgot to mention when booking that they take 150 off you as a guarantee Also staff let themselves in our room without knocking at 7pm when we were getting ready to go out to see if the maids had cleaned the room No apology for just walking in Our room was very small and meant to be a deluxe double room so would hate to be in a standard room Nice hotel and good location but definitely not worth the money they charge , Very good location and very good breakfast 
261439,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The room might of been a little bit bigger as the double bed was in the corner so I had to crawl the length of it to go to the bathroom , I thought that the room although small was extremely well designed Also we both loved the delicious breakfast 
261440,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Bed wasn t ready on arrival When we returned at 6 it still wasn t ready It was rectified quickly There could be a map indicating location of the hotel and local area, Room was small but adequate We didn t have breakfast although did have room service pizza which was nice

261443,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Room keys had to be changed 3 times as they wouldn t work consistently which was frustrating Some of the staff later in the day and at breakfast weren t as pleasant or helpful as the first gentleman I think this was due to the hotel being very busy, Great location Hotel was clean spacious and modern We had an executive double room which was a great size and extremely comfortable for our weekend city break One of our rooms was ready for us to check in early and the gentleman on reception who first received us Extremely great value for money
261444,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, Check out at 10am is pretty steep but becoming the norm all over, We were celebrating our anniversary and were given an upgrade Excellent male receptionist checked us in and was professional welcoming and nice 
261445,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, We had no normal tea bags in our room just fruit teas Clumps of hair on the carpet in the room not very clean We did mention this at reception on checking out but just said sorry Disappointed , Nice reception area bar etc Breakfast was lovely

261449,DoubleTree by Hilton London West End, The first room we were in was the newest refurb in the hotel so looked fantastic Sadly it was backed on to the service lift and as such was running from the early hours until 23 20 at night great room bad placing didnt expect this given it was an executive room , Hotel was great across the board the staff were excellent and even more so with changing the room when asked
