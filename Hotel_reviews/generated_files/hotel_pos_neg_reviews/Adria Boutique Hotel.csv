257339,Adria Boutique Hotel, We stayed here a year ago and were very happy with this hotel We were disappointed this time round The service was not quite so good and both kettles provided to us in the room were broken We were assigned one of the disabled rooms where the bathroom facilities were at too low a height to use comfortably , Location very good and room clean and generally comfortable
257340,Adria Boutique Hotel, The hotel ran extra holds on my card after I had left meaning that my account had a pending transaction for several hundred pound despite having already paid the full amount for the room Staff were incredibly unhelpful in resolving this and on several occasions offered blatantly wrong information The air conditioning in the room didn t work The room was quite noisy and traffic trains can be heard at all hours There was no tea making facilities in the room and the selection for breakfast was quite poor Overall very poor value for money , Wonderful location right in the heart of Kensington Easy to get to with Tube shops restaurants within walking distance Bed was one of the most comfortable I ve ever slept in Room was cleaned quite well every day 
257341,Adria Boutique Hotel, No bar , The rooms were very comfortable and spacious with all the necessary amenities Bathrooms large and well equipped Staff friendly and helpful 
257342,Adria Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Chic design and quality furniture and material Elegant and subtle butler service and staff Soft drinks complimentary Spacial bathroom Tranquil neat convenient and safe neighborhood 
257343,Adria Boutique Hotel, The organisation was a little haphazard check is process wasn t explained There was no alcohol served which was not a problem but could have been noted when booking The breakfast was not well staffed As a single female having breakfast alone I was ignored and felt it was because I wasn t accompanied There strog traditional vibe , Decor was beautiful Common areas were comfy 
257344,Adria Boutique Hotel, Room very very small Not much room to move Service lift running from very early in the morning and loads of noise from above all through the night Told receptionist on check out about the noise and basically told us it was impossible for there to be noise from that time No apology or anything Would have went back if the receptionist had at least been sympathetic , Bathroom was really nice Loved the heated marble flooring 
257345,Adria Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Room staff and service was excellent Bed and high thread count sheets felt amazing after a long day of sigh seeing Shower and deep soaking tub were equally as grand Water soft drinks and nespresso provided free of cost was a great bonus The best and most helpful perk was the complimentary smart phone in the room that we were able to use at any time to make calls within the U K and to the USA for free We could also take the phone with us to use as a map and guide to navigate around the city This was incredibly useful Would highly recommend this hotel 
257346,Adria Boutique Hotel, I did not find the hotel staff particularly nice and welcome They could arrange the check in procedure to be a bit more personal Also they are not very clear on specifics , I have stayed at this hotel before the room are always lovely This time it was very quiet as requested which was brilliant The previous time was right on the main street and it was quite noisy at night
257347,Adria Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Really helpful and polite staff Lovely room with super comfy bed and soft sheets The hotel only has off street parking which I didn t realise but for us that was fine and they don t serve alcohol this wasn t an issue for us and you could provide your own if you wanted to The mini bar was stocked with lovely soft drinks coffee machine and water all free of charge We asked for a kettle and we re brought tea bags and fresh milk within minutes They d even boiled the kettle for us ready for making the baby milk Really thoughtful 
257348,Adria Boutique Hotel, The shower was poorly designed and water overflowed into the bathroom When we complained staff suggested rolling up a towel and putting it against the shower door It worked but clearly this is a longstanding problem A promised visit by the maintenance man failed to eventuate One of the reasons we booked the Adria was that the website lists airport shuttle We assumed this meant a shuttle is provided to Heathrow It isn t it means staff will ring you a taxi , The hotel is centrally located It s about five minutes walk from two tube stations and close to major attractions like the Natural History Museum the Victoria and Albert Museum and Hyde Park The staff were very welcoming and pleasant The hotel decor is beautiful the bed was comfortable and the air con was excellent 
257349,Adria Boutique Hotel, I didn t like the fact that you have to ring the reception eveytime you enter the hotel, The location is great and the decoration is rather elegant Breakfast is good value for the money
257350,Adria Boutique Hotel, Much as I hate to say it the breakfast left a lot to be desired something that Adria should work on If you are hung up on the traditional English breakfast all you need do is take a short walk down the road But apart from this absolutely delightful , The gracious people the design the large rooms the elaborate bathrooms the exquisite furniture the array of delightful knick nacks in the room and the attention to detail create an ambience that was just superb For once I looked forward to coming back to my room in the evening to relax to read to write and to walk around the spacious room as I made my phone calls on the excellent WiFi while the lovely London summer breezed in through the large windows of my room called Harrods 
257351,Adria Boutique Hotel, There was no information book in the room regarding facilities eg the spa how to use the Tv in the bathroom the nearest tube etc I am sure it would have been resolved if we had spoken to reception about it , Location great for 2x tube stations bars cafes bakeries Stayed on a Friday but traffic not noisy Slight rumble on tube underground but not intrusive at all Decor beautiful expensive plush well maintained no chipped paint etc Room exactly like the photo Bed huge and extremely comfortable Duvet light and warm Air con very effective Butler service excellent Couldn t fault it 
257352,Adria Boutique Hotel, The staff didn t let me into my room as my husband had booked it there was no one to greet me at the door and I had to ring on the bell many times to be let in I ordered drinks to my room that never came , The room was beautiful
257353,Adria Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Great location in south Kensington Close to public transport and maybe tourist locations but at the same time in a quieter area so there was no worry about noise
257354,Adria Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location for the Royal Albert Hall Science Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum The nearest tube station is Gloucester Road five minute walk Lots of places to eat The single room was small and compact and needed a towel rack 
257355,Adria Boutique Hotel, Wifi was slow and cumbersome Wouldn t recommend if you need to work in your hotel room , Comfortable bed and little extras in the room were very pleasant
257356,Adria Boutique Hotel, pillow cases and sheets were not smell clean and main door was not confortable to enter you have to ring the bell and wait, complimentary drinks in the room
257357,Adria Boutique Hotel, In one of the smallest rooms one easily bumped one s for on the sliding door rail but I still give a 100 position reviews, Liked everything The design fabulous with the best high end everything the staff is impeccable Everyone of them They contributes grately to my overall enjoyment of the hotel 
257358,Adria Boutique Hotel, Definitely a hotel aimed at business customers rather than leisure There is no bar or alcohol on the premises which is absolutely fine but this should be made more obvious in the hotel description prior to booking , Lovely spacious room and bathroom
257359,Adria Boutique Hotel, 1 Staff was very unprofessional Although some tried to be service minded it did not come natural Some were just plain rude In the 4 days we spent at the hotel there was no supervisor or manager present so I guess staff was mainly lost at what to do On the third day they were still asking for our breakfast preferences while there were only few guests 2 The room was very very small The hotel website itself doesn t mention the m2 of the rooms booking com does in London rooms are generally small but at this price 3 At some point the airco did not work and it got very warm in the room 26 degrees Celsius According to reviews this is a regular problem but staff started discussion in front of me how to solve this 5 stars it took a while and several discussions with staff and I lost faith but after some persuasion the maintenance guy solved it 4 There are several nicely decorated communal rooms suitable to escape a very small hotelroom If only they were not playing Arab music all the time Also no alcohol is being served Out of respect to the Arab culture is hidden somewhere on the website We have stayed in several muslim owned 4 and 5 star hotels in Asia and alcohol was usually served out of respect to the multicultural world citizens We saw no one using these rooms anyway , Location was great close to tube and plenty of bars and restaurants Breakfast was a only small buffet but a complete choice fresh and reasonable priced Beds were comfortable though short 
257360,Adria Boutique Hotel, You could hear the street noise I would recommend replacing the existing windows with some noise insulating ones The staff who welcomed me could have been warmer and friendlier There were few things not functioning in the room e g bathroom heating safer and alarm clock when I mentioned it at the reception they immediately fixed everything however it would have been nicer if they would have checked before my arrival, The room was so lovely I really liked the design one of the best I have seen in London If it wasn t for the street noise I would 100 stay there again 
257361,Adria Boutique Hotel, As usual the lighting in the bathroom was insufficient to use the mirror and too far away Actually the bathroom could ve been better designed altogether The temperature in the room was way too hot and the thermostat didn t work Resorted to leaving the window wide open , Very attractively decorated but our bedroom was very small and mostly filled with a massive comfy bed Very helpful staff Good location for both South Ken and Gloucester Road areas 
257362,Adria Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Elegant compact intimate hotel Offered cappuccino upon arrival Tea served to our room when we were tired Receptionist staff booked our cabs and took very good care of us Every part of the hotel was clean and beautifully decorated The food served was delicious 
257363,Adria Boutique Hotel, I would have liked the heated bathroom floor but it was too hot to stand on without something on my feet It would have been good to have an armchair in the room to sit on rather than have to use the bed, The hotel location is excellent there s plenty to do locally plus it s easy to get travel around from there The room was generally very nice with the bed being very comfortable The staff were very helpful
257364,Adria Boutique Hotel, There was very little to not to like about this facility the actual Hotel happens to be situated over a well below the ground tube track it took a day or two not to notice the distant whiz noise of a tube train coming and going and it really didn t have any impact on our stay , The hotel staff were very accommodating and did all they could to make sure our stay was super enjoyable 
257365,Adria Boutique Hotel,No Negative, This is a beautiful small hotel which is immaculate throughout the room was very comfortable the bathroom perfect This place could be exceptional it just needs something more from the ethos and routines the staff are friendly and efficient but there is not much soul or warmth in the place If the owners could recognise and change this this would be a go to stay for me in London
257366,Adria Boutique Hotel, 1 for a business trip I expect efficiency at London it was very slow and very long waiting 2 the room has no heating only air con very old 3 the room is at the main street just very noisy always, location was good
257367,Adria Boutique Hotel, Quatari owned hotel No alcohol Arab atmosphere not English Electrical problems A C very difficult to set , Comfort of bed Friendly staff 
257368,Adria Boutique Hotel, Level of service was not in keeping with its star rating The welcome was perfunctory and at one time we called reception with an enquiry and no one turned up Staff could have made more of an effort especially with the prices asked , Room was excellent and well furnished The location was very good close to the underground and the rest of London 
257369,Adria Boutique Hotel,No Negative, The decor was lovely the bathroom had nice features like a walk in show plus a separate tub and the location is good as well and the bed was really comfortable 
257370,Adria Boutique Hotel, We had no hot water the first night and then the following morning we had no electricity but they did provide us with another room to get ready for our wedding reception and also complimentary breakfast , The room was very nice and we were there for our wedding night They sent us a platter of fruit and hot chocolate 
257371,Adria Boutique Hotel, You can hear the Tube which is fine during the night but they start fairly early in the morning Didn t bother me but some people might not like it , The hotel itself was great The location was great The staff were really friendly The bed was extremely comfortable Excellent price Would definitely recommend it 
257372,Adria Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Quite nicely decorated rooms Cute lounges with a fireplace give a homey feeling Also the hair dryer was excellent unlike the usual hotel dryers It was one of those professional ones 
257373,Adria Boutique Hotel, No problems at all , Great place in a superb location Adria is perfectly located in Chelsea the neighbourhood is fantastic of course and the hotel is within walking distance to all Chelsea South Kensington attractions The hotel itself is beautiful the staff helpful and kind I stayed in a relatively small room but it was conveniently arranged and furnished Sitting rooms on the ground floor are good for meeting friends or visitors if the space in the room is not enough mine wasn t but the communal areas are still very private and nice I didn t have enough time to use the sauna but it is good to know that one is available 
257374,Adria Boutique Hotel, That i had to leave, Everything Tha staff were so polite and friendly The hotel was beautiful and in such a good spot to go to lots of areas of london by tube or walking
257375,Adria Boutique Hotel, The shower water leaked out the door bc the door didn t close Heard the metro rumbling constantly below the room and the guests above walking around at odd hours of the night Breakfast was good but expensive for continental , Great bathrobes and amenities furnishings and decor Helpful staff although service could ve been faster Not sure where they had to go to get hot water maybe downstairs to the basement 
257376,Adria Boutique Hotel, The staff post check in did not make me feel welcomed The bathroom in my single room had no hooks or towel bars Unsure if there was an accessible entrance but there are stairs to the front entrance which makes arriving with luggage cumbersom especially since I never saw a doorman or bellhop , The overall style of this hotel was classy The staff at check in were very pleasant The complimentary mobile was an unexpected perk 
257377,Adria Boutique Hotel, No warm dishes in the continental breakfast Shower cabin leaks water Some small details no electrical plug near the bed no hooks in the shower , A hotel with a flair of luxury An exciting stay 
257378,Adria Boutique Hotel, The shower in the single room is tiny There is not much to move in it Overall even though the room is small there is room to move around , Friendly staff Great location and decore Would definitely stay here again 
257379,Adria Boutique Hotel, Only 3 coffee pods are provided in the room Was told by Karen that extra pods had to be purchased When I objected I got some more pods Hot breakfast not available, Very friendly staff Well appointed and spacious rooms
257380,Adria Boutique Hotel, I wouldn t say this is a problem but if you want to relax with a glass of wine this hotel serves no alcohol None of the details about this hotel state this so if you re planning a romantic weekend and a bottle of champagne you ll be disappointed , The hotel is beautiful the staff lovely the rooms beautiful The hotel is quiet and stylish and perfectly located 
257381,Adria Boutique Hotel, nothing, Quiet location but perfect for our concert in the RAH and close to underground station free mobil phone during our stay 2 TV in the bathroom We really hope we can stay there again in the future 
257382,Adria Boutique Hotel, The television in the bathroom unfortunately did not work and there was a lack of coffee provided however overall was still a great experience , The bedroom was amazing with a top bathroom Very modern and very posh The whole look of the room was sublime 
257383,Adria Boutique Hotel, Needed a towel rack in the compact single room , The staff was exceptionally helpful Decor was very appealing with custom light fixtures furniture and artwork Great neighborhood near to Victoria and Albert Museum and Natural History Museum lots of restaurants and a few blocks from several tube stations 
257384,Adria Boutique Hotel, 1 The bed sheets were not changed everyday which I was fine with On one occasion I did have food stains on the sheets and the house keeping seemed least bothered to replace the sheets with new ones 2 I did complain a few times about how bad the Internet was It was beyond standard Internet you get at any other hotel The 6 nights I stayed there I could not work unfortunately I shall attach a picture of the Speed test I did after they claimed to have fixed it , The location of the hotel is great Walking distance to Central London Room layout was nice even though I had the smallest room in the hotel I did not enjoy my stay with them but I would give the hotel 1 last try if they sort out the issues I had 
257385,Adria Boutique Hotel, The room was totaly small We had rarely space to walk around the bed We did not have enough space for 2 small suitcases May be it is the smallest room they have In this case I would suggest to reduce roomrate We paid the same price like the rooms we saw on the pictures a those rooms look pretty large We couldn t close the bathroom window and it was getting cold Help was promised but nothing happened We were not unhappy to stay only one night ,No Positive
257386,Adria Boutique Hotel, Nothing really if I really had to search hard to find a fault I d say they could do with towel hooks in the bathroom , So many lovely little touches from the complimentary soft drink mini bar underfloor heating at the touch of a button beautiful finishes to the rooms and lovely lounge rooms on the ground floor 
257387,Adria Boutique Hotel, my room was the smallest in the hotel would like to see the other rooms next time , Quintessentially London boutique hotel 2 minute walk to south Kensington tube station plenty of cafes for breakfast on the go and restaurants for dinner after a day in the office Staff were informative efficient and welcoming Delightfully designed also Would definitely stay again 
257388,Adria Boutique Hotel, The air conditioning in the room fluctuated from very cold to warm despite it being kept at the same constant temperature , The staff are helpful and friendly Ms Karen particularly made our stay memorable 
257389,Adria Boutique Hotel, The check out is 11 and the check in is 15 pm and they have one house keeping for the hotel in addition the hotel give 2 keys and they charge me for lost one of the keys around 25 and when i book the hotel again i get my room with one key and i ask thrm where is other key they evade the answer , Nice hotel for family they re too quite nice Qatari food for the lunch not far away from knightsbridge about 10 min walking or less
257390,Adria Boutique Hotel, 1 Hotel Manager is rude and not professional at all 2 Hotel tries to get extra charges on your room bill as much as they can 3 I don t recommend this hotel due to security issues as well as you don t feel safe in this hotel at all I was a victim to stay in this hotel, Nothing
257391,Adria Boutique Hotel, Hot food was average Smaller sized rooms , Lovely reception rooms Pleasing atmosphere Nice new rooms and bathroom Luxury touches like free mobile wireless phone use Nice continental cold breakfast Complimentary mini bar was classy 
257392,Adria Boutique Hotel, The 10 breakfast is below average for such kind of hotel I would prefer to have my breakfast at a nearby caf instead , Free coffee and mini bar Great location in South Kensington Good service 
257393,Adria Boutique Hotel, Nothing , Fantastic room spotlessly clean comfortable and spacious Staff especially Mercy were wonderful and could not have been more helpful or accommodating Beautiful breakfast as well We ll stay here next time we are in London absolutely brilliant place and thank you so much again for everything 
257394,Adria Boutique Hotel, nothing, The bed was very comfortable the room a good size and the bathroom excellent My partner had her best night s sleep in weeks when we stayed here 
257395,Adria Boutique Hotel, An iron in the room would have been good It was too dark to see in the full length mirror, Lovely luxurious decor Comfy bed and pillow Nice view Friendly courteous staff and a good location
257396,Adria Boutique Hotel, Staff very poor Very rude Don t know what you need to make a cup of tea You may need a cup , I liked the decor and the comfort of the hotel silent room 
257397,Adria Boutique Hotel, Slight noise from traffic outside But staff helped me with ear plugs No issue further, I loved this hotel Outstanding decorations and staff were of the best in the business The rooms were warming and very comfortable I wish my bed at home felt as good 10 10
257398,Adria Boutique Hotel, Coffee facilities are provided with an option of tea via the butler It really would help if tea facilities were provided as a matter of course , The Hotel is decorated and appointed to a very high standard and the room and bathroom facilities are superb Staff are very pleasant and accommodating and breakfast really good 
257399,Adria Boutique Hotel, The wifi is weak and slow There is no tea making facilities in the room but a note beside coffee machine has said that if the guests want to drink tea they could ask for it However we were charged for the tea boiled with tea bags If it is not for free I think the hotel should let the guests know , Fresh juice and delicious dates Good location A middle east style hotel 
257400,Adria Boutique Hotel, The bathroom sink leaked the shower water was cold the first night and if someone walked upstairs it sounded as if the roof was coming down Also beware that there is no alcohol served in this hotel , Friendly and accomodating staff Great features such as a warm welcome with some complimentary beverages The price of food was very readonable Beautifully designed spaces Huge bonus They provide a free smart phone with free calls to the US and a few other countries and free internet for the length if your stay The mini bar is also complementary 
257401,Adria Boutique Hotel, They could do a full English breakfast Whilst the breakfast is good simple I am British this is London We need bacon and eggs , Very Nice Hotel Staff were very helpful and the general feel is really good Great value for money considering 
257402,Adria Boutique Hotel, Room was a touch too small and had to step over my cases stayed in Fortnum No blow dryer in the room , Bed was comfortable Bathroom was lovely General decor was very nice The hotel had personality Great location
257403,Adria Boutique Hotel, The WiFi is the biggest issue it was very slow Breakfast was not included and wasn t very good the hot breakfast arrived cold and the poached eggs were overcooked , The attention to detail at the hotel was amazing The bed was really comfy the decor throughout the hotel was lovely turndown service was great and complementary drinks on arrival well received 
257404,Adria Boutique Hotel, Worst ever hotel experience in London after 20 years going regularly The room was so small it didn t even have space to fit the taps in the toilet believe or not Just a bed no room for a little table or a little chair And all that for 200 ,No Positive
257405,Adria Boutique Hotel, Staff not well trained and not always visible Frustrating when in a hurry as we were given a theatre visit When we returned we said we d like tea in the lounge it took fully 15 min for someone to come to take our order and when asked to bring some biscuits we were told it wasn t possible , Beautiful property stylishly appointed Nice beds ok continental breakfast
257406,Adria Boutique Hotel, Not a problem for me but some would say the room is small if you are traveling as a couple This is typical of the area though , The property was very cosy and pretty with deep red carpets and personalized room names The staff were lovely and showed me around the facilities and the check in out was super quick and easy The bathroom was beautiful and all marble The bed was super comfortable and there were good movie channels Very reasonably priced I stayed in Knightsbridge for 3nights before at more than double the price and only regret not staying there the whole time 
257407,Adria Boutique Hotel, My small single room had a couple small annoyances like cramped shower and awkward bathroom layout and AC that didn t work too well Not a big deal though, Very nice location Kensington Service is very attentive If you re into a queit relaxed atmosphere look no further Also extremely clean and really well decorated space
257408,Adria Boutique Hotel, The lighting in the room was poor and difficult to adjust The underfloor heating in the bathroom was far too hot and we were unable to turn it off at all which made the room uncomfortably warm , The hotel staff were lovely really helpful and accommodating The bed was extremely comfortable and the rooms lovely and quiet 
257409,Adria Boutique Hotel, The communication with the hotel staff before arrival trying to arrange spa treatments and an early check in was very cold not a good start to the stay but when there the staff couldn t do more to help , The hotel we thought was very comfortable and luxurious the number of rooms to relax in outside of your room made it feel like staying with friends 
257410,Adria Boutique Hotel, Small details that should be fixed e g a shower head that sprayed the floor a window blind that let in a lot of light We stayed in the Mini room so small that my husband and I could not pass each other on one side of the bed , The staff was uniformly welcoming and helpful The physical facilities were lovely and many little extras were included such as the Handy similar to a cell to use while a guest The breakfast not included for us was very good 
257411,Adria Boutique Hotel, Poor breakfast Visit any of the amazing breakfast spots in the area , The location of the hotel is perfect South Kensington is a very lively area The amenities and the comfort are perfect 
257412,Adria Boutique Hotel, The room was very very very small which made very uncomfortable for two people to move around Lighting was poor and too dimmed There was no shaving mirror Main mirror in bathroom was too far to see properly for make up or shaving Bath was quite difficult to get in and out, Hotel is very well decorated
257413,Adria Boutique Hotel, Nothing could have been better Superb , Incredibly comfortable and relaxing hotel All the staff were truly great with nothing seeming too much trouble We stayed for a concert at the Albert Hall as its only a short 10 minute walk away Will definitely be back in the future Thanks to Mercy and the team 
257414,Adria Boutique Hotel, no complaints, small and luxurious boutique hotel with in room nespresso coffee machine beautiful lobby rooms and room great design everything looks very new
257415,Adria Boutique Hotel, However the experience was not as good as it seemed The facilities didn t deliver heating in the room was not working And for a 5 star the staff was very rookie in handling the situation I had first reported the problem right after check in and had to push for a follow up until I went to sleep at which point there still was no sound solution a non working extra heater and extra layers of cover at 12am when I pushed for it At checkout they did not know about the issue and when pointed they did apologize which I appreciate however that did not make up for freezing at night , The building facilities and rooms look very nice And the hotel is located in my favorite neighborhood in London 
257416,Adria Boutique Hotel, It would have been nice to have a room with a view, The staff were helpful and friendly any requests were delt with quickly and efficiently The hotel was exactly what I expected after reading other reviews A thoroughly enjoyable experience 
257417,Adria Boutique Hotel, Because of the quiet location you can just about hear the distant rumble of the tube trains In a noisier hotel this would probably be lost , Very comfortable well appointed rooms
257418,Adria Boutique Hotel, We stayed in the umbrella The bed was far too soft I am not an overly heavy person and the bed sank drastically, Excellent service and fantastic facilities
257419,Adria Boutique Hotel, Room and en suite rather cramped No where to hang towels , Very courteous staff Well finished decoration Good breakfast Very close to South Kensington tube and museums 
257420,Adria Boutique Hotel,No Negative, The staff was excellent The comfortable and relaxed quiet atmosphere was exactly what was needed after a long flight I would recommend this hotel It s close to the museum row Royal Albert Hall and the tube I would stay here again without a doubt very pleasant stay 
257421,Adria Boutique Hotel, Would have loved some tea and tea cups rather than just espresso making facilities , A beautiful hotel very comfortable Staff very friendly and helpful Quiet apart from the occasional rumble from the tube but not intrusive Excellent location a few minutes walk to NHM and V A
257422,Adria Boutique Hotel, Didn t realise it was a dry hotel but they still offered us an ice bucket and glasses for champagne we had brought which was very kind, Staff were really attentive and welcoming especially when we arrived a couple hours early for check in there was no issues at all Room was lovely and the shower was awesome The hotel in general seemed really quiet and seemed like you had the place to yourself even though it was fully booked 
257423,Adria Boutique Hotel, Seating in room could be improved Lighting was poor in both bedroom and bathroom , Great location to Hyde Park and shopping Comfortable bed Quiet location 
257424,Adria Boutique Hotel, Room was very small On the first night we decided to order a bit of room service which included a cheese board The crackers were soft therefore we barely touched the plate Mentioned this only on departure but still had to pay for it The speaker for the tv in the bathroom was faulty For a 5 star hotel I guess I expected more there is just nothing remarkable to say about the place Won t be returning , Comfy bed lovely bathroom with underfloor heating free soft drinks in the mini bar an espresso machine Staff on arrival were really nice the room was cleaned to perfection 
257425,Adria Boutique Hotel, The shower in the bathroom leaked out onto the floor abit that was our only downfall apart from the hotel was beautiful we both loved our stay , Very welcoming staff they were beautiful like the location all in all a very enjoyable stay thank you very much
257426,Adria Boutique Hotel,No Negative, I was upgraded to a bigger room with a symbolic surcharge despite my booking mistake the bed was small for me Miss Jessica was very understanding and helpfull My new favorite hotel in London where I will stay on my frequent future visits 
257427,Adria Boutique Hotel, Quite pricey even though with a lot of pleasant things The conditioning system si somehow designed the way that the moment you leave the room it switches back to the initial set up which was pretty chilly for me , The hotel is very nice and stylish Great to have the floors in the bathroom heated Complimentary drinks are very much appreciated The staff is extremely polite and helpful Even the TV in the shower Many small elements are adding to the great experience 
257428,Adria Boutique Hotel,No Negative, A lovely boutique hotel with a very intimate feel Fantastic for a romantic getaway The customer lift was out of order so we d been upgraded when we checked in There is a staff lift so it wasn t a big issue Photo is of the Elizabeth Jr Suite 
257429,Adria Boutique Hotel, Can t think of anything I didn t like oh the shower leaked when you had the pressure on high, great room plenty of space wonderful bed People were always helpful and available 
257430,Adria Boutique Hotel, The staff were pleasant enough but not a wealth of knowledge about restaurants and pubs We made our own bookings The hotel lacked atmosphere and seemed very quiet and serious , The hotel is very beautiful and in a wonderful location Our room was very compact probably too compact for our taste 
257431,Adria Boutique Hotel, Our room Tea Room Level 2 too small for the room rating Definitely not 5 star , Very helpful staff and wonderful shared facilities Great location 
257432,Adria Boutique Hotel, If you open the window be aware that some bugs might enter the room, 1 excellent location with two nearby tube stations 2 quite neighborhood with cafes and restaurants 3 clean bathroom and bed sheets 4 comfy beds 5 junior suite was good and spacious6 underfloor heating was perfect especially in autumn cold weather 
257433,Adria Boutique Hotel, That in the rooms their were minimal Coffee making pods for machine provided Also nothing was provided in the room if you did not like Coffee You would think a hotel of this caliber Would give guests the choice of both and this service would be included in the room price As it is in most other hotels of this rating We also had real problems with the air conditioning With our room being very warm We reported it twice but nothing was done about it , Fantastic location Lovely friendly staff Beautiful rooms fixtures fittings 
257434,Adria Boutique Hotel,No Negative, My friend and I arrived in a very tired state after separate red eye flights and were greeted in a very welcoming yet professional manner It was too early to check in but our luggage was collected and we were shown to the dining room where we could partake of the buffet or order breakfast During our week s stay the entire staff was very helpful and most gracious We are coming back 
257435,Adria Boutique Hotel, two payments taken from my account Did try and tell lady on reception that payment already made however she insisted on taken payment again therefore I am not very happy about this No breakfast despite when I originally booked it said free breakfast Didn t pay as poor breakfast package went to cafe round the corner cafe forum and breakfast was great and good price Felt the staff were a little awkward , clean comfortable room Underfloor heating Bath robes and plenty of towels in room
257436,Adria Boutique Hotel, One of the butlers had a body odour problem , Staff were accommodating of all requests small offerings like free mini bar drinks and coffee were much appreciated I loved the option of spending time in the various drawing rooms feeling like I was in someone s beautiful home rather than a hotel 
257437,Adria Boutique Hotel, Breakfast was nice We ate at the hotel one evening as we had to get to a show We waited over an hour for the food as it was being freshly prepared Hotel don t seem geared up for a quick turnaround , The staff were very pleasant helpful and professional The hotel was like home from home We were upgraded into a junior suite which was lovely Room was clean spacious and had lots of lovely featured Location was good with the underground tubes very near by 
257438,Adria Boutique Hotel, It was a little too warm in the some of the lounges and the breakfast room , The exceptional service of the staff They were very welcoming and very helpful Nothing was too much The different lounges meant you were able to have a room to yourself to chat and drink tea from lovely china tea sets 
257439,Adria Boutique Hotel, We did not have hot water in the shower despite attempts by the hotel to make repairs however we did have warm water so it wasn t too much of a problem and we were compensated with free breakfasts, The staff were professional very friendly and extremely helpful the hotel is quiet and restful with stylish decor location is excellent with 2 nearby tube stations and many restaurants our room was upgraded on arrival and was very comfortable wi fi availability excellent breakfasts gorgeous flower arrangements on exterior
257440,Adria Boutique Hotel, Only one minor negative was that room temperature was difficult to control and heating set a little too hot for our comfort , Staff outstanding extremely helpful and warm Genuine hospitality in a gracious boutique setting Location wonderful Close to many attractions and very convenient for transport and access to airports 
257441,Adria Boutique Hotel, The room and the shower area are really small In the bathroom there are no where to hang clothes or towels Quality of Wi Fi in the room was poor had not used Wi Fi in public areas so cannot comment, Good location very clean room cozy decor Most members of the staff are friendly and helpful 
257442,Adria Boutique Hotel, The first room was dirty They changed the room but in the new room it was a problem with hot water in 5 stars hotel the answer of the manager the hot water have difficulties to rich 4th flour The last night we arrive to the room at about 1730 the cleaning ladies were in the room We wanted to take quick bath to go to a musical But we had to wait And we had to explain the manager What are standards of 5 stars hotel we didn t like the fact that all day they played Arabic music in the public places dining room lobby we came to England not to arabic country ,No Positive

257444,Adria Boutique Hotel, My room was on the first floor and the trains ran directly below I did not like that they put me there as a first time guest My bed creaked a lot And the robes and towels were very dingy for a luxury hotel So was a bit weary of using them Breakfast although complimentary was not brilliant and at room service dinner they did not have s lot of the teas and some of the starters they have on the menu I also didn t realize they did not serve alcohol on the premises which wasn t crucial to me but nowhere did I see that on the site , I appreciated the they upgraded me to a beautiful suite but since I had no idea what my junior suite was I didn t know if it was a significant upgrade But the rooms were lovely I loved the fresh flowers 
257445,Adria Boutique Hotel, The single room is a strange shape This meant that the bathroom sink was tiny not big enough to wash your face deep enough to shave I actually missed when spitting out my toothpaste and spit on the floor The shower stall leaked flooding the bathroom There was nowhere to hang your towel The desk was taken up as a tv stand so I had to work at my bed There is a kitchenette which I didn t need but if someone wanted to use it there were no cups cutlery plates It s there for show It seemed like the room was trying to look impressive rather than be really functional , Staff are extremely attentive and helpful 
257446,Adria Boutique Hotel, As the website honestly shows the small single is really small but keeps its standard as a luxury boutique hotel Good enough for a single business traveller Some may feel slight sound coming from the tube a bit uncomfortable in particular when taking a nap , The atomosphere is classic British but with Arabic flavour Good enough for having relaxed time with gorgeous feeling The staff are full of customer first spirits
