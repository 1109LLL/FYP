372810,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, The pictures did not represent the real rooms The bathroom was small and uncomfortable The fan was not working Thus I will not use booking com again as this is the 3rd time it has let me down,No Positive
372811,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel,No Negative, The Hotel itself was immaculate nice warm welcoming with very friendly staff I proposed to my partner on the weekend and they made the stay extra special and has left us with perfect memories we will be back Couldn t fault this hotel at all 
372812,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, Prices were extortionate even by Londons standards Breakfast 30 each I was charged nearly 40 for one straight drink in the bar There is a tray in the room with a few goodies on which is part of the minibar but some friend thought this was complimentary as it was next to the tea and coffee facility and were charged the earth for it very misleading We stay in London often and have stayed in 4 5 hotels and never been ripped of like this before in fact we usually receive complimentaries expected more from a Jumeriah Room was small for a 5 property check in process was ridiculously long and the front desk puts 100 block on your debit card on arrival to cover extras given the appauling costs of the extras its easy to see why , Room was nice
372813,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel,No Negative, Helpfulness was excellent from all the staff we met at reception restaurant and room service quite a few of the team had worked for the company for 9years and were proud to do so Also enjoyed the garden terrace very much and a great lunch 
372814,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, i have asked for a meeting room they said it was not available but when i had my meeting in the hotel restaurant there was a meeting room just next to it and it was completely empty and we could see inside because the door was open during my meeting time but the property did not offered it to me which i think it was very poor from their side ,No Positive
372815,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, The gym was on a different hotel Walking distance but different building , Excellent location shoos coffee shops walking distance from the tube and the park Love the terrace the people are absolutely fantastic All of them 
372816,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, That I didn t stay longer The only negative which really wasn t a big deal at all was that the paint on the doors in the room was peeling and or missing This could be updated but other than that nothing negative , The staff went out of their way to make our stay absolutely amazing They were all incredibly friendly and were so helpful in organizing anything we wanted It was my birthday and they brought us flowers and chocolates and waved our room service charges Absolutely so much more than we ever expected Made us feel like absolute royalty 
372817,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, Stayed in a room near the lifts although not noisy we were a little put off with the room location , Staff and customer service some of the best we have had in London really pleased Location perfect for us for a walk to a restaurant around the South Kensington area and then a concert at the Royal albert Hall Really good underground links to the rest of London from the Knightsbridge area Shopping on the doorstep of this hotel in Sloane St Facilities in the room Excellent Coffee machine Dressing Gowns Slippers Toiletries and turn down service at night Concierge staff and housekeeping Excellent when I requested an iron and Ironing Board Keep up the good Work 
372818,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, Read above Windows windows staff talking outside the main doors , We did not get any sleep due to night staff talking out side the main doors which our room append to be right above And the local super duper sports cars using our road as a speeding track sadly I would highly recommend the windows are renewed to a latest standed of double glazing 
372819,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, The foyer ground floor restaurant area and stairs if you don t use the lift are a bit tired and in need of updating, Thank you to Jumeirah s Doorman he directed me to a Q car park a short distance away cheapest option too Good Continental breakfast 
372820,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, Reception area was under staffed had to wait and queue every time we need to talk to reception as only 1 person was working , Great location good value for money very clean fab breakfast 
372821,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, the continental breakfast is very low in selection and very expensive compared to other hotels served with no eggs or beans or sausage if you will have an omelet they will charge 30 pounds the rooms are very small i had a twin room and barely could move around ,No Positive
372822,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable The staff were very pleasant Great location 5 mins walk from Harrods and the underground I would love to stay here again 
372823,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel,No Negative, great boutique style hotel based on a quiet street ROOM A little tired needs a refresh of paint decor Great staff friendly helpful
372824,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, I was disappointed to find a bathrobe in the the wardrobe on arrival with old chocolate stuck to the back off it Eventhough I placed it on the floor with the dirty towels twice it was hung back without checking and not removed until I personally complained at reception Staff where apologetic and offered a full complimentary breakfast as opposed to our included continental breakfast which was sufficient However I cant help but wonder if it is actually normal practice to not wash bathrobes in between guests , Great location easy walking access to all major tourist attractions
372825,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel,No Negative, Amazing hotel the staff were very friendly and catered to our every need The hotel is in the best location it s walking distance from harrods and 2 minutes from Sloane street Would definitely recommend stay here 
372826,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel,No Negative, Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel is home away from home I frequently travel alone and this hotel is always my choice as they always look after my needs The staff is very friendly and they always do their best to accommodate every requirement any time of the day night The food isn t bad too The bed is comfortable and the little bottles of shampoo and conditioner are amazing and of a good quality 
372827,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, All good, The staff were very helpful I got a great night s sleep since the bed was really comfortable and and the shower was good so I felt ready for my meeting the next morning The coffee in the room was excellent I ll come back for another stay when I can 
372828,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, No gym in the same building You need to access to the neighbour jumeirah hotel , The location is very good and close to all major attractions within London with easy connection to the tube 
372829,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, It was very noisy in the middle of the night with the neighbors party in the next room I had to at 4am the call reception to complained about the noise,No Positive
372830,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, A gym in the building would have been great but I happily accessed the gym at their partner hotel which was wonderful 2 minute walk away from hotel , Great bar and restaurant Very comforable rooms 
372831,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, Rooms are small even the so called superior ones just 17 square metres I think The others are just 15 m2 apparently Didn t eat there nor used the bar Really annoying fridge one of those ones that if you move something off it s pad you could end up being charged for it unless you tell reception you didn t use it No room to put in even your own small bottle of milk or a sandwich without removing bottles Take care , Nice location convenient if you want to be in around Knightsbridge Clean comfortable rooms but only really ideal for one person 2 people would find it a chore sidestepping each other 
372832,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, No where in the booking information or hotel information was there any mention of a security deposit requirement Luckily for us this wasn t an issue but definitely something which should have been made clear prior to our stay There is noise from the outside until about 11pm mainly people driving their super cars up and down the road but there s an iPod dock in the room which can help drown out the noise , Very attentive staff Excellent location literally on the doorstep of Sloane St and 3min walk 5min in heels from Hyde Park Nespresso coffee machine in the toom is a nice touch Plenty of wardrobe space to keep luggage and room size was fairly decent which was a concern to me after reading a few reviews beforehand saying the rooms were too small You also get robes and slippers and an umbrella for that typically British weather in your wardrobe 
372833,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, Couldn t pick anything We enjoyed it better than the Dorchester or Ritz , Breakfast was brilliant wide variety on the menu or buffet table All of the staff went out of their way to make our experience at the Jumeriah Lowdnes comfortable 
372834,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, Room service were extremely rude Refused to take my breakfast order Wanted me to write it down in a paper and leave it on the door knob House keeping disgusting Saw the people cleaning my room and got disgusted when I saw the woman clean my bathroom She literally grabbed everything I had creams contact lenses tooth paste etc placed next to sink and just dumped them in the sink so she can clean the the sink counter Yuck Plus the towels smell , Location is great
372835,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, the rooms are small and the bathroom door if you lock it doesn t open and its kind of expensive of a small room like that Thank you, location and stuff
372836,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, Housekeeping not brilliant Needed to call the to ask for Englush breakfast tea that they did not replace and the same evening they did not even turn up to prepare room for the evening , Friendly staff Location of hotel 
372837,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, The hotel needs an update much better standard of cleanliness, The staff is super friendly the facilities of the sister hotel Jumeirah Carlton towers are excellent
372838,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, I m a Muslim it will be nice to offer prayer mattress and washing flush in some room next to the toilet seats The breakfast needs more options since I don t eat cheese or eggs , I liked the staff and the locations and Service
372839,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, Everything was fine, Comfortable bed and well appointed room Ideally located just a walk from Sloane street and Harrods Good breakfast Friendly helpful staff Enjoyed my stay will go back 
372840,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, Not a lot of atmosphere in bar area but then it s probably more of a business hotel across in Carlton tower much busier, Breakfast cooked fresh Staff friendly and helpful
372841,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, Only issue the gym is not located in the same building its a short walk away about 5min max , Nice rooms bit small But clean Friendly staff and helpfull Was a nice stay 
372842,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, Had to ask for complimentary water Charged me a different price as to was was offered on booking com Expensive rooms and room service Felt more like a 4 star hotel than 5 star , Staff are helpful and kind Rooms spacious and very clean You can use the swimming pool and other facilities at the next door Jumeirah Carlton Doorman was very friendly and a highlight of the hotel 
372843,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, Small rooms but most disappointing was the lack of swimming pool It s photographed on their home page but it s actually in the small print around the corner and across the road in their sister hotel ,No Positive

372845,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, Expensive bar drinks All bars closed at approx 12 midnight including sister hotels bar at carlton towers , Fab location Great staff BOOKING COM had cancelled my rooms even after I had rang the hotel direct and preauthorised my credit card payment
372846,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, The staff was not very polite other then the womens and washing ladies were very kind and polite The restaurant is very small and also the bar Had to go out of the hotel and move to another hotel to use the spa and gym which should have been a bit more information about We were looking forward for the spa but had no information about prices etc And its quite misguidence when you order a hotel which they give pictures and information about a spa but the hotel dosent even have a spa And food was not good , The hotel rooms are nice and clean quite comfortabel 
372847,Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel, Overpriced for the type of building type of room and absence of view from the building The bathroom was also very small, Nespresso machine in the room
