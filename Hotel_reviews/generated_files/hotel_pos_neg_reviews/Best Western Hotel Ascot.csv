480134,Best Western Hotel Ascot, The breakfast was horrible They charged us a lot for the laundry The water was very expensive Air conditioning was not working good Mosquitoes were there on the room Overall the stay was not comfortable It takes 100 euroes to reach this place from the airport , The location was good Walking distance to the center There was a good restaurant near by 
480135,Best Western Hotel Ascot, The room and the whole hotel is a bit old fashioned , Great location since it is walking distance to the Dome and the central square Very friendly staff

480137,Best Western Hotel Ascot, The room did not look like the pictures Water flow from the shower was really weak Only one power socket in the room had to unplug the TV to charge my phone and camera at the same time The air conditioning wasn t doing much , Great location within walking distance from the metro station Staff was friendly and helpful 
480138,Best Western Hotel Ascot,No Negative, Staff was really friendly the bathroom was a bit broken water was not draining and the hair dryer was reallyyyyy old Not working properlybut the rest was ok and Massimo from reception was a very friendly and helpful dude Breakfast was good too

480140,Best Western Hotel Ascot, AC was not very cold, Location was great close to the Duomo Room Was large with King size bed and it had a bathtub which mean large bathroom It was clean Breakfast was good Restaurants close by were excellent
480141,Best Western Hotel Ascot, The staff could be more helpful except Patrizio who was super helpful Breakfast was also not the best This is an overpriced 3 star hotel , The location is excellent very close to the Missori metro station and a couple of tram stops The Cathedral is of walking distance The room was clean internet was fast 
480142,Best Western Hotel Ascot, no bottled water for our stay although its usually the case for hotels in Europe no toothbrush and other amenities too I asked for a toothbrush from the housekeeper but she say it can only be provided if I speak to the reception 1st She don t speak English well enough so we are not sure if it means you ll need to pay for it it will be nice if amenities be can provided in the booking , bed is too hard for me but my friend likes it so it really depends on personal preference staff is friendly 
480143,Best Western Hotel Ascot, The hotel had all we required maybe we are easy pleased It is just a hotel for God sake , There was a partial public transport strike during on stay in Milan The staff were most helpful in assisting us in overcoming this challenge 
480144,Best Western Hotel Ascot, I loved everything, Excellent place Service is great the breakfast is a little bit on the down side but it s ok As for location wise it s 500m from Duomo so pretty much in the center of the city 
480145,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Impossible to boil water in kettle as the plug does not fit the socket what a surprise Fortunately phone charger fit well, Location is good just few minutes by foot from touristic area Check out time till 12 00
480146,Best Western Hotel Ascot, The room was a bit musty and the decor was stale The breakfast was ok but the bacon was not cooked and the coffee was terrible , location and the staff were very friendly
480147,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Wi fi was terrible you have to enter username and password in every 3 minutes There is no carpark at the hotel You have to pay 22 for the car for a night for a carpark near the hotel , Rooms was ok breakfast was good 
480148,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Hotel is rather old I would say it s a three star hotel not four Breakfast was quite ordinary and simple , Staff was very welcoming and friendly Always smiling and ready to help Placement of hotel is great Close to Milan university
480149,Best Western Hotel Ascot, We had urine left on our toilet The cleaner came to correct this but we were not apologised to No milk is supplied with tea and coffee making facilities We rang reception to be told we do not supply this but then 10 mins later someone came up with a little jug Twice when we rang reception we found staff very rude answering the phone The tv in the room had no English channels and no hotel staff wanted to help us Breakfast is continental with bacon egg and hotdog sausage But there is no beans tomatoes mushrooms etc to complete a full English so don t expect this Food is very nice though , The room was lovely beautiful bathroom windows open nice and wide good amount of wardrobe space safety deposit box beds nice and comfortable Found extra pillows and duvet in the wardrobe Tea and coffee making facilities Hotel nice and clean Breakfast was lovely Nice quiet environment Not rushed Food nice and hot Reception staff mainly friendly and 1 was extremely helpful 
480150,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Mediocre breakfast with sludgy coffee Bath with no plug so whirlpool wasn t an option Advertised airport shuttle doesn t exist and never has A little too far away from the centre and between metro stops , Large airy room well decorated and lit comfortable bed wifi that actually worked throughout the hotel 
480151,Best Western Hotel Ascot, The reception staff had to provide cups for the bedroom coffee facitities and sufficient toilet roll that the maid had forgotten to supply The bathroom smelt as if it had been inadequately cleaned rather like a public toilet We were offered a change of room which we declined because we liked the quietness of the room and we expected them to address the problem which did not happen , The room was quiet at night The beds were comfy with extra pillows provided The sound proofing was good 
480152,Best Western Hotel Ascot,No Negative, Quiet Street good sized rooms and bathrooms very good beds good breakfast walking distance to some of the main sights some good Restaurants nearby friendly personel good value for money
480153,Best Western Hotel Ascot, One of the staff was speaking sharply and giving short answers with no smiley face at all and dominant behaviour Others were all kind and helpful Another problem was that there is a kettle and some courtesy tea coffee bags however the kettle does not fit to the plug so you cannot use quite clever This is why I guess there was a thick amount of dust on the kettle nobody could use it before The last problem is that there were not many restaurants nearby , The room and bathroom were large enough It is in a silent district and not far from metro station The whole property is new tidy and quite Breakfast was good 
480154,Best Western Hotel Ascot, WiFi speed could be improved Hygene is comparable to other hotels in Milano in this price range but could be improved Some rooms don t have a 2 person bed but 1 bed only Not a problem if you re travelling alone but don t expect a large roomy room with a king sixe bed if you make a single person reservation There is limited parking space for taxi s in front of hotel so sometimes a bit dangerous to get out of the taxi , Rooms are not overly large but sufficient WiFi is free and a bit depending on which room you are in of normal speed No premium WiFi avail Hotel personel is very friendly efficient check in and check out Since the hotel doesn t use a digital key there is always 230V power in your room allowing you to charge devices while out of the room Easy walking distance if Duomo and central area of Milan Low noise levels in hotel 
480155,Best Western Hotel Ascot, wifi didn t work in the room unless at some very strange spots It was a bit hot in the room but no problem opening the window , Rich breakfast central spot very helpful and kind staff nice room
480156,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Small cramped room the shower cubicle was so small that I had to lean on the wall so I could wet my legs cannot be rated as a 4 star hotel, Staff Patrice was very helpful he made the difference to otherwise ordinary hotel
480157,Best Western Hotel Ascot, In the bathroom found marks of the previous guest and the washbasin was almost stuck , Good location quite street and walking distance from duomo close to metro Nice breakfast Good English spoken at reception 
480158,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Staff could be friendly it helps especially after you have spent 12 hours at Orly airport due to the terror alert , Location was good The breakfast was scrumptious and wonderful Spacious room clean and roomy bathroom 
480159,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Wi Fi was poor Weak signal on 4th floor Had to keep signing in Tea and coffee making facilities in room but no cups and saucers Local tax was 5 per person per day day which made the price higher than expected , Comfortable hotel in central position 
480160,Best Western Hotel Ascot, The shower needed a more careful cleaning as there was some mildew at the join of the base to the walls, The buffet breakfast had a good selection of items
480161,Best Western Hotel Ascot, The room was not what we paid for judging by the images on the website while booking especially the bathroom which was horrible And of course they denied getting us another room The staff was not friendly at all for the exception of maybe one person from the bar and they did not even know English which was bothersome The worst part was that there was WiFi technically but I could not connect to it from a higher floor at all so I had to sit at the reception to get some work done It was not a pleasant experience at all , The food wasn t that bad but there was no diversity The only good thing about this hotel is probably its location a 15 min walk from Duomo 
480162,Best Western Hotel Ascot, The only thing that was a bit annoying was having to log into the wifi constantly however not a big issue , It was easy to find and there is a parking garage in front of the hotel Nice room and good breakfast 
480163,Best Western Hotel Ascot, They had a problem with the heating water machine so in the morning there was no hot water and it was impossible to take a shower The staff was visibly sorry and appologized and offered me another room so I could try a warmer water but it was cold anyway By the afternoon they had solved the problem but for me it was check out time It was really annoying a day without a shower I was really disturbed by this Won t go back there , Staff very friendly and helpful 
480164,Best Western Hotel Ascot, There not a lot happening in the immediate vicinity but it s a short walk from restaurants etc , The room was spacious by European standards and the shower was nice and hot with great water pressure 
480165,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Not modern room design and bad hairdryer , Great location only 10 min walk from Duomo Very friendly and helpful staff especially the receptionists Parking garage available right in front of the hotel very easy to find Good breakfast offer I will recommend to friends and come back 
480166,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Location is very close to city centre and shopping, Good location nearto city centre and very close to private parking hotel has 20 discount for the parking per day is 22 euro before discount
480167,Best Western Hotel Ascot, the most annoying hotel maids ever They just entering the room to clean all the time without even knocking the door Very rude Also no respect in the morning they just making so much noise outside my room I couldn t sleep Unacceptable for a hotel ,No Positive
480168,Best Western Hotel Ascot, The rooom was a tad dark faced onto a busy road secondary glazing helped with noise reduction but made the room warm the air con wasn t working , Staff were super friendly the location was so convenient 10 minute walk to Duomo The breakfast was good lots of options Bed was comfortable the shower was AMAZING epic water pressure 
480169,Best Western Hotel Ascot, On weekdays the small street before the Hotel can be very noisy and you can hear it very well at least from the 2nd floor where we stayed Breakfast was decent but not by any chance a 4 star hotel breakfast However it was satisfactory The worst part was the wifi though If an internet connection is imperative to you try a different hotel No wifi here in spite of what the say , Very good location Ten minutes walk from Duomo and five minutes from the nearest metro station Also 15 to 20 minutes walk from Naviglio Grande Satisfying price for a Milano Hotel Very clean Good choice if you re travelling to Milan for a few days 
480170,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Only spot in hotel with wifi was the lobby and as we had travelled from Australia and only had crappy Vodafone sims from the UK it was extreemly inconvenient ,No Positive
480171,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Furniture and carpet in bedroom was shoddy and tired Wi fi worked fine in the lobby but not at all in the bedroom Bathroom shower screen hadn t been cleaned properly on the inside , Bed was comfortable and linens were good There was a good variety of foods for breakfast Location is good for accessing Duomo and M3 metro line 
480172,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Wifi not available from some rooms Flourescent light bulbs with mercury , Friendly helpful staff Large rooms Great small market 1 blk away public transportaion very close lots of beautiful interesting sightseeing shopping restaurants within walking distance Planning to go back 
480173,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Absolutely terrible breakfast Also we sat through breakfast watching the waiter flicking crumbs etc off tables onto the floor and resetting the table for new guests Yuck , The housekeeping staff and the female breakfast staff were really attentive and lovely people 
480174,Best Western Hotel Ascot, AC not cooling room hot Shower falling off Toilet bidet strong smell Room smell when entering Can t compare to a best western in Australia Breakfast served at a non dining area Worst sliced bread, Helpful directions
480175,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Since I am tall would have preferred a larger room but it was good as Milano usual size , Very helpful staff Location is great as its a 10 min walk from Duomo and a 5 min walk from Missori metro subway station 
480176,Best Western Hotel Ascot, breakfast variety and staff Sheets of bed have smell Had a non smoking room but I can smell smoke from rooms above or below from the bathroom ventilation , Location value for money and the reception staff 
480177,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Breakfast is very simple and the same everyday we stayed for a week so it was hard to enjoy breakfast after day 3 and the biggest fault of the breakfast is they dont offer any veg No tomatoes or cucumber Also one of the breakfast staff was very rude one day by coming up to me and embarrassing in front of the whole restourant telling me off for making a sandwich to go as apparently it s not allowed to take anything out of the restaurant BUT i had a very early trip so simply didn t have time to eat my breakfast at the hotel They either need to state it very clearly that these are the rules or need to be more descteeet if they want to make a comment to a customer Also that same waighter was very loud when making up tables where as others were very careful not to desturb the customers , Great location for visiting the centre Duomo and also walking distance to the restourant district Reception staff very helpfull and responsive 
480178,Best Western Hotel Ascot, The rooms are a bit dated and the bathroom could really use a fix up but hey you are on a city visit everyone should be out and about not in the room , Very easy walking distance from Duomo 5mins The staff is super attentive they even noticed my wife s birthday and surprised us with a bottle of prosecco not a standard you could expect from a 3star Very good value for money Great parking garage across the street if u are with a car 
480179,Best Western Hotel Ascot, A bit old fashioned and run down breakfast was VERY basic, Good location close to Duomo but nice quiet location public secure parking across the road
480180,Best Western Hotel Ascot, reception should be more customer friendly As Milan is expensive anyway in relation to what you get this hotel is no different , Location of this hotel is its best aspect Also we were staying in one of the appartments of the hotel and it was spacious and clean
480181,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Firstly they did not put us in the hotel section but dumped us in a dodgy apartment which included their hotel supplies After complaining they moved us into the hotel into a better suite , The breakfast was good with lots of variety including fresh fruit juices yoghurts cereals breads and pastries 
480182,Best Western Hotel Ascot,No Negative, Great location not too far from Metro Clean spacious lovely room with excellent choice for breakfast included in price and the staff were very pleasant and helpful Happy to book this hotel again 
480183,Best Western Hotel Ascot, No resturent in the hotel The room I got was prepared for handicap person so the bathroom was without bathtub the WC was so high When ever you come back to room you have to input the WiFi user name and password again All TV channels were in Italy no English channels There is no coffee machine in room or at least a hot water Usually all hotels i visit provide daily free bottle of water or two but here daily i have to buy which cost more, The location is perfect stuff are friendly rooms are big
480184,Best Western Hotel Ascot, AC is not good Hot in the room , Location good 5 min walk to metro Nice reception recommended good restaurant and helped check availability in late night 
480185,Best Western Hotel Ascot, WiFi didn t work in our room throughout our stay Bathroom door latch was faulty and they could not repair it , Walking distance 10 15 mins from Duomo
480186,Best Western Hotel Ascot, you need to ask for a new wi fi password everyday however it s not a big deal , Helpful stuff clean rooms and good accommodation for a reasonable price
480187,Best Western Hotel Ascot, A better AC The first day it was amazing then it becomes less good the AC I don t know why , Ts really nice and really good hotel I 100 recommend it 
480188,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Quibble quibble quibble Honestly where does this negative energy direct one other than a roller coaster ride to the road to nowhere To improve and enhance is an ordainment but let us also not take those gestures of kindness as our birth right Listen to that voice from within This universe of ours along with its myriad imperfections will seem a celebration then Italy is one such place as is Spain That Latino spirit with seemingly endless dimension enough to embrace eternity within its fold , The night before my departure to Milan Torino wreathed in mist and drizzle wore a magical air The enchantment refused to subside as I reclaimed each cherished spot bidding the city goodbye with promises to return The five night introduction to the much undervalued terrain of Piemonte had been wonderful The train for Milano Centrale was poised to depart from Torino Porta Nuova at the dot of 07 00 am Ania had booked a taxi in my name which was to deposit me at the latter juncture from the Loger Confort The FrecciaBianca journey traversing the capital cities of Piemonte and Lombardia was smooth and efficient The bustling Milano Centrale was before the traveller within an hour and a half A taxi ride to Via Lentasio and the Best Western Ascot followed in quick succession It was to be my second stay at the property after 2014 albeit a much shorter one Check in was instant The booked double room seemed small upon first sight although very comfortable After a quick bath I brought this aspect to Graziano s attention who promised me of remedial action The very next morning I was given a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite The space was vast with amenities aplenty as was the luxuriously appointed bathroom The remainder of time simply flew and I felt like a much indulged in monarch The breakfast was good as always excellent cafe lattes and cappuccinos prepared on the spot and the walking distance to the Centro Storico struck me as more manageable than before Graziano s amazingly generous gesture along with my old pal Massimo s bonhomie ensured a great return stay 
480189,Best Western Hotel Ascot, It was OK for what we wanted to attend a family wedding but the rooms and hotel need a little updating , It was near to the city centre A good basic breakfast Rooms cleaned every day linen towels changed 
480190,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Couldn t connect with wi fi neither in the room nor in the lobby Breakfast was very poor some of the products didn t seem fresh cornflakes the smell at the stairs was repulsive room was very dark and small the bathroom wasn t cleaned properly Price inadequate to the quality overall the hotel deserves three stars maximum , location was the only positive thing about this hotel
480191,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Staff not very friendly air conditioning not working properly safe of my room was not working, Location good restaurant nearby L Isola del Tesoro breakfast
480192,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Nothing to complain about but if you are coming by rail it is a long way from Milan central You need to catch a taxi , Staff were very helpful and polite Room spacious and well equipped with mini bar and hospitality tray Breakfast was included with a good choice of food including scrambled eggs and sausages cold meats and the usual continental offering of rolls croissants jam etc Also good choice of fruit Very close to the Duomo and galleria for shopping 
480193,Best Western Hotel Ascot, It s very expensive and does not worth it Of course I was at the weekend of the champions league final but I would say that I could save staying away and gerting taxis all the time and would be cheaper As it was my first time I d not recommend, breakfast good and beds as well Location just 10 min from the piazza duomo Staff friendly and always supporting and giving great advice
480194,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Common areas need re redecorating Breakfast was of low quality, Rooms were OK clean and tidy The communal areas are run down and need a make over Location is good only 10 min walk from the Duomo 
480195,Best Western Hotel Ascot, WiFi was allowed for only a couple of devices Even with that it was spotty and the connection dropped repeatedly , Comfortable room Good breakfast Walking distance from Duomo 
480196,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Breakfast is indeed as the other reviews say But at the end of the day it doesn t really matter that much as we were happy to head out to the city to discover new little cafes Certainly no dealbreaker , Great location and easy metro access We went for a weekend trip and couldn t complain about the place 
480197,Best Western Hotel Ascot, The net curtain in our room kept falling down and the safe did not work A, The room was of a reasonable size The large bed was extremely comfortable The water was hot and a bath very welcome after a day s sightseeing There was a good selection for breakfast and the breakfast room was apeaceful place to start the day 
480198,Best Western Hotel Ascot, The rooms are a bit old fashioned At my arrival a face towel in the bathroom was missing and the hotel itself in general is definitely not a 4 hotel , The hotel is well located close to M3 tube station and 10 minutes walking to the Duomo

480201,Best Western Hotel Ascot, Always be aware of the city tax which is 5 euro per person per night in Milan what is not included booking via booking com And too bad we did not get the room with the bath but later we realized the room was so big and with shower because it was handicap room, My first experience with the Best Western hotel really good location near the city center by metro yet very quiet area Big classic and luxurious room very comfortable bed good wifi connection free toiletries If you can afford this hotel I d really recommend it Really luxurious breakfast too
480202,Best Western Hotel Ascot, The property is very old All the furniture are very unlike and the design of the room looks like in mid ages The door of toilet was really damage and unpainted The toilet and the room spells really bad I paid around 370 euro for one night for my myself my wife and my son And what i got was really far from this price,No Positive
