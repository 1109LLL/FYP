254458,Hotel 82 London, No kettle in room No mirror in room Breakfast terrible Morning receptionist not friendly, Friendly receptionist on arrival Good size room modern and clean
254459,Hotel 82 London, With a Booking com rating of 8 4 I thought I was going to be staying in quite a nice little boutique hotel but ended up in a closet I had a room with no natural daylight or fresh air The one window that opened had an internal fire escape next to it so I had to sleep with it closed The air conditioning which didn t work to begin with was noisy The minibar didn t work at all The hairdryer was one of those old hot air boxes with corrugated wide bore tubing The curtain rail was missing a finial Maybe the double rooms are better but this little single was way over priced compared to other London hotels Breakfast was included but I just wanted to get out into fresh clean air in the mornings So glad I only booked 2 nights , The linen was nice the little bed was comfortable and I liked the wood flooring Even with the curtains opened the room was pitch black during the day so there was certainly no problems from light pollution at night 
254460,Hotel 82 London, No negative comments , Everything was spot on Room more than adequate for three guests Spotlessly clean lovely bedding Bed comfy Microwave etc provided Ideal for a stay of more than a few days Location brilliant to tube station All staff friendly could not do enough for you Had basement room really quiet as was all the hotel Did not pay for breakfast but complimentary breakfast offered Although no kettle in room there was a FREE coffee lounge Well worth price Would recommend and without a doubt stay there again 
254461,Hotel 82 London, Bed was a king size but it left very few space in the room to move Breakfast was quite limited They offers the english breakfast but when we asked for it they ve run out of eggs , Location and very friendly staff Easy to reach from main London airports 
254462,Hotel 82 London, It didn t bother us but the lift was tiny one person 1 suitcase or 2 people We didn t bother with lift , The triple room made central London affordable It was about 4 minutes walk to Baker St stop of National Express bus from Luton and Stansted and when returning to airport bus stop was only 2 minutes away with stop on Gloucester place Baker St being one way at this section The breakfast buffet had more variety than expected for this price the cooked breakfast set us up for several hours Wifi was pretty fast Apart from kettle there was a microwave 2 ring stove and fridge in room if someone wanted to get provisions from nearby grocery shop 
254463,Hotel 82 London, The staff was rude the hotel untidy and the air conditioning not working I had one of the most horrible experience at this hotel, I did not like any thing
254464,Hotel 82 London, Two twin beds pushed together i d expect better for 90 a night The most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in springs feel like they re broken and dig into your back Shower pressure was terrible Bathroom very grimy needs a good scrub or replacing Cups had bits of tissue paper stuck to the inside obviously where they d been dried with loo roll , Staff were friendly Hotel is in a great location for Baker Street Marble Arch and the tube station
254465,Hotel 82 London, The mattresses were quite soft and uncomfortable and could use an upgrade The decor of the rooms were also quite outdated The hotel didn t provide things found at other hotels of the same category like complimentary water bottles cups in the bathroom etc The air conditioning in the room was not cooling as much as it should have Overall we expected more value for the price we paid , The location was the best part of this hotel but it wasn t the value we were expecting for our money 
254466,Hotel 82 London, The pictures are probably photoshopped I was disappointed plus arrived after a long day and didn t have hot water went to the reception and she just didn t do anything except making a call This was unacceptable I was provided by a mail to send a complaint great service And we paid over 200 pounds for a night I think I could have gone instead to a decent hostel , The location of the property was amazing really close to everything

254470,Hotel 82 London, The breakfast was awful cold Hot buffet not much of a cold selection unless you like supermarket bought biscuits We ended up with just toast but with a two piece toaster this took forever to cook The cost of breakfast was certainly not worth it as we then went for a coffee and pastry when we left our hotel The shower in our room was old and had quite a lot of mould Our room looked out to an open space brick wall and the noise shouting from the apartment block at the back went on until 3am , There was not much I liked about this hotel
254471,Hotel 82 London, This is a budget hotel first and foremost Do not expect any frills for all your money Well overpriced for what it is London has a great hotel stock you can find better Would be about ok at 70 a night There is no phone in the room So if you want to call reception you have to google the number and call using your own phone That was a first for me The beds really were uncomfy Old and soft you could really feel the springs Gave me a bad back and neck The two single beds kept parting slightly too The room light switches are not wired correctly into a multiway ring If the switch by the bed is off the switch by the door does not turn the lights on It took us ages to turn the lights on after we entered the room If only there was a phone to call reception I actually walked down to reception to ask how to turn the lights on and was told to put my key card in the wall slot There is no wall slot have the reception staff actually been inside the rooms The shower was warm but not hot However to be fair this was fixed once we reported it Of the 2 shower heads only 1 of them worked One of the 3 light fittings was missing a bulb Staff half way through a conversation with me just picked up a ringing phone without even saying excuse me Breakfast was really not worth the effort of walking all the way to the basement wifi was slow ended up just tethering from my mobile to stay online , Location Aircon Room was cleaned after first night 
254472,Hotel 82 London, Fancy shower but no pressure on the water so we could barely take an ordinary shower Very small room well it s in central London Very small elevator ,No Positive
254473,Hotel 82 London, unfriendly staff asked about gluten and vegan free options at the breakfast were assured this was available When we arrived there were no vegan substitutes The room had ripped wallpaper marked walls not as advertised cost over 120 per night Unacceptable for this price, good location
254474,Hotel 82 London,No Negative, Location was fabulous between Marylebone and Baker Street underground and the overland train to Wembley to see a show was brilliant Walking distance if you able to and like walking to oxford street and Regent s Park but also on good bus routes if you tired Room was very modern and ideal for weekend Stay for a couple or single traveller
254475,Hotel 82 London, The bathroom smelt due to blocked slow draining sink There was no plug Shower didn t work properly of three options only one worked which was the rain shower which was very low pressured Breakfast was very poor Cooked buffet was tepid uht milk and instant coffee , The room was nice and had air conditioning The location was very good Staff were friendly 
254476,Hotel 82 London, Staff not tentertive don t really care about the customers staying over beds not great at all Bathroom was dirty no curtain over the window wife got an electric shock from the plug socket in the public lounge area Just not good enough Much better hotels to stay at in London Don t bother with this one AVOID , Breakfast
254477,Hotel 82 London, Double bed was in fact 2 singles pushed together so not very comfortable Shower involved pulling screen out over floor to get in and turn shower on which had a very poor jet of water difficult to get too wet under Breakfast finished at 10am we arrived at 9 30am and there was not enough space for us to sit at a table We waited for a while then the waitress said she d let us know when there was a table ready We eventually returned at 9 55 still no space so waited until a table was available The staff were ok to serve us but there was not much available to eat by then We didn t bother the next morning , Location of Hotel and staff were friendly
254478,Hotel 82 London, We requested 2 single beds and got 1 small double bed The room was very small and the air conditioning didn t work It looked nothing like the photos I seen on the website and there is no way it should be classed as a 4 star hotel It was without doubt the worst value for money I ve ever got when paying for a hotel ,No Positive
254479,Hotel 82 London, The mattress was too soft and the room was very noisy if you stay there request to not stay on the ground floor , The location was brilliant just moments from Marylebone High Street and Baker Street 
254480,Hotel 82 London, on the other side my room was on the basement so it felt like it hasn t seen some fresh air in a long time it was clean but I got a bit allergic at first later I got used the main problem was the toilet it seemed nice but it was one of the worst toilet seats ever it was broken and although it was clean it had steins on it and seemed terrible, I had mix feelings abt the hotel The staff was really nice and helpful so points to that Plus the bed and towels were good and the deco of my room as well 
254481,Hotel 82 London, The breakfast is quite restricted however tastefull for those who seek a British breakfast every morning , The hotel is well located near downtown and tube stations The staff nice and helpfull The room was cozy and functional with an astonashing shower They have baggage locker for your luggage after the check out 
254482,Hotel 82 London, Basic breakfast strange design on taps that were hard to work Hairdryer didn t work then replacement one given did not have a UK plug Staff were helpful but you often had to wait for them to return to reception Lift is tiny Quite a lot of traffic noise, Location is great lots of places to eat nearby and close to tube station
254483,Hotel 82 London, In my room windows were blocked and you could not open it , I love this place because there was a kettle to make a hot tea in the room This is a base of my existance place was fantastic very near Oxford street Lovely breakfast eggs bacon and all stuff you never eat in Italy in the morning Yummy 3
254484,Hotel 82 London, Black mould in bathroom obvious hair and dirt on floor in both room and bathroom Poor lighting and in room facilities Damp smell , Getting out and about in Marylebone 
254485,Hotel 82 London, To tell th truth the hotel is not worth living in it kindly speaking My colleagues have arrived on a business trip with the expectations to work in the hotel as the hotel says that wifi works properly but my colleagues had no possibilities to work there as this wi fi was extremely slow in all public areas But this is not the only problem The air conditioning in the room did not work as it shoul and that s why it was extremely cold in the room do you imagine the situation when you arrive exhausted after work and are afraid of catching the cold beacause you can not turn off the air conditioning And then you see that the ventilation aperture was plugged with dust and dirt which is very bad for health And one more problem the window curtains were awfully dirty That s not the condiotions which could be offered by the 4star hotel The rooms we have booked should have been 18 but in fact they were too small and my colleagues didn t even have possibility to place their luggage In addition to all these problems there is no lobby in the hotel and as the consequence no place to work in Also there are no sockets to plug in a standard European plug neither there is a plug adopters we could borrow at the reception The 4 hotel in London shouldn t have this kind of problems We highly do not recommend this hotel and looking forward for the refund because the money we have paid do not correspond to the level of the service of the hotel ,No Positive
254486,Hotel 82 London, I really didn t like the room it sounds silly but there wasn t a proper curtain which meant I couldn t block out the light on an evening I also had no hot water one day , I chose the hotel because of it s location to where I needed to be 
254487,Hotel 82 London, The shower cubicle was not really clean The mattress was really hard and uncomforable , Great location easy to reach by bus or underground The room was nice staff was very helpful The breakfast buffet was Ok 
254488,Hotel 82 London, the breakfast was strange they offered a cooked breakfast just no meat , location was excellent really close to Baker Street station food places lined the street to and from the hotel to the station so plenty of food options 
254489,Hotel 82 London, Bathroom very old and very uncomorfotable for tall persons Breakfast very ordinary nothing special starting serving at 7 30 It could be at 7 00 like all hotels Not a value for money choice, Room was cozy and as descripted The location is very good near to underground stations and Oxford street The reception personnel was very polite and helpfull
254490,Hotel 82 London, Wifi not working in the bedroom not solved during the stay for several days No solution proposed by the reception only one recommandation from the staff please come at the reception on the couch to get connected Strong humidity smell in the bedroom due to the lack of ventilation in the bathroom I did not tried the breakfast included in the fare since the 1st day the room was complete with no table available I was asked to wait or come back later I simply left , Good location in London Not so far from Marble Arch or Baker Street Well equipped fridge ironing material 
254491,Hotel 82 London, One night is enough in a windowless room well there were windows but they looked out over a dark stairwell No chair in room no space couldn t do any work in there When i arrived there was no one on reception and anyone could access the property I had to telephone a number for attention It was explained to me that there were CCTV cameras but even so at a time of heightened security alerts this did worry me, It was a very clean and well equipped room with iron ironing board hairdryer flat screen TV fridge and very decent shower The breakfast was well cooked It was quiet at night 
254492,Hotel 82 London, Booked as a deluxe room so paid extra tiny bathroom with fixtures and fittings loose and wobbly Taps shower fixings toilet seat impossibly cramped and loose Shower was warm at best and a very cheap look Shower cubicle too small for anyone over 6 ft tall Room itself smallest hotel room I ve ever stayed in Room door hits bed as you open it Bed itself appeared nice and well presented but soon realise it s two singles pushed together that seperate easily on the polished plastic looking floor No desk or dresser one very small wardrobe the room was in the basement and laid out like an average student Bedsit No phone to reception Hotel boasts room service which is actually log in to a website and order from a local takeaway thats signed up to the website IF they are open a cycle courier delivers I did try thos and it was ok but flatters the hotel Breakfast was poor on selection and the dining room was tiny cramped and little effort put into service Had to help myself to hotplate buffet style which limited food I think there was staff in the room but there was a constant smell of smokers from the kitchen which seemed to fill the whole basement Throughout the stay staff were either smoking in the kitchens not even making eye contact or in the case of the receptionist on arrival just not there had to phone to get checked in reception is not a lot more than a booth in the wall Overall I have stayed in hotels around London and can call them hotels with their plus and minus points I have also stayed in hostels around the country This place had the feel of a hostel but just spruced up with modern plush looking decor and furniture I booked and thought I d paid for a smart London hotel for my partner and I to enjoy a west end show We loved the show and our time in the city but sadly the hotel part took away that aspect and I am extremely impressed , Smart interior and the room look was modern and appeared well presented on first impression
254493,Hotel 82 London, Booking process once at the hotel was a bit of a shambles Room was booked with a business credit card to which they needed a signed authorisation form from the card holder in advance The request for this form was sent out of office hours making the process on arrival very difficult The room eventually had to be booked with another credit card and photos of proof of ID signature and the authorisation form had to be emailed over before the booking was accepted Wasn t ideal on a Sunday evening after travelling to the hotel The room was also at the front of the hotel on a busy and very loud road The outer window was open and it didn t seem like it could be accessed through the inner window , Good breakfast and wifi was good Bed was comfy TV in room and bathroom facilities good 
254494,Hotel 82 London, The room was small all was bed with tiny place to move around which was quite different than the pictures I guess it was bad luck Cleaning was ok but under the bed was full of dust The power of the shower was very low and we did not have hot water on the morning So it was fine for a weekend but could have been better Thanks, The location is very good
254495,Hotel 82 London, Though previous times had been quite good this time the bathroom flooded due to rain coming through a fan on the ceiling Couldn t believe it when came back late in the evening Went downstairs as there is no phone in the room The receptionist said she couldn t do anything as the person who could fix it was not able to come at 11 pm She said had never happened before which I don t believe as in London rains every other day The blind wouldn t work so the light woke me up at 6 am and was freezing cold as one window wouldn t shut Horrible night, Location is superb as I like anything near Baker Street tube station as I has 5 lines as well as Marylebone neighbourhood for me is handy I also like the fact that is new well and old house totally refurbished and has the comfort
254496,Hotel 82 London, Uncomfortable bed dirty bathroom no replenishment of drinks facilities very poor breakfast very noisy all night felt like I was sleeping in reception, Location
254497,Hotel 82 London, room in the basement never the best place to stay Very stuffy Some people bigger than me are unlikely to fit into the shower cubicle I am only 5 8 and weigh 78 kg Receptionist never bothered to look anywhere when I asked Could I borrow an umbrella for a couple of hours Straight answer was Nope we dont have any , Good breakfast Clean rooms AC console on wall in room but no actual AC There was a separate heater though it was too warm for me as I had walked a fair bit to get here Good Sony TV with most responsive remote I have witnessed in any Hotel room 
254498,Hotel 82 London, It is impossible to sleep They gave me a room in the front of the main street with a lot of traffic during all the night Windows are old and does not repair from noise they no have elettricity adaptateur nor shower soap in room breakfast poor ,No Positive
254499,Hotel 82 London, Where can I start The staff were only interested in getting our money of us the moment we walked in other than that they were completely absent The shower was cold and dirty The chambermaid didn t clean anything The breakfast was poor quality For 255 I expected basic cleanliness and decent service didn t get either , The location is very central
254500,Hotel 82 London, Not clean, Overrated for a 4 star Not clean We found a number of hairs in the sheets and we had to have the bed redone Very Little soap in the rooms for washing 
254501,Hotel 82 London, Breakfast only started at 7 30am and I had to leave the hotel for 7am yet I had paid for breakfast they didn t make this clear that it started so late they are not suitable for business travellers The Wi Fi didn t work the kettle was missing from my room there were no glasses a light fitting was hanging off the wall the mattress was sunk and in desperate need of replacing the floor was dusty and dirty the secondary double glazing was broken so there was a gap which made it sound like the window was open despite wearing ear plugs I didn t sleep a wink The room was freezing and the heater was placed by the window which is normal I guess but had drapes over the top of them so when the heater was turned on there was a burning smell The blind was broken Reception wasn t particularly friendly in the morning when I left didn t even ask if I had good stay Will never stay here again , The location was good
254502,Hotel 82 London, Where to start The receptionists that were creating more problems than solving them Many little things just did not work toilet paper rationed lights bulps burned disgusting muck in bathroom floors stayd 3 nights had to change keys 2 times warm breakfast but no bacon loud tv in breakfast room tables and area not really fitting 3 people all 3 person rooms in the basement without any view from the window Good god I would totally automize the whole reception and spend the money in fixing things and housekeeping , Location services and restaurants in the nearby area
254503,Hotel 82 London, It was advertised four star the breakfast menu was basic no bacon or sausage tinned food The shower was dated old and did not work properly The storage area for bags was poorly secure If a 3star i would have accepted a little more, Ease of the booking process
254504,Hotel 82 London, The woman in the reception when I checked in was totally unfriendly it was like I killed her mother and I came to ask for a room bad Wi Fi problem with my tv that I solve it myself because they didn t care even I mention it two times The cleaning wasn t very good in general No value for money , A good place to stay close to tube breakfast ok almost the same every day staff friendly and the room had enough space 
254505,Hotel 82 London, Some problems with the blinds blackout The blind could not be adjusted and did not cover the bottom of the window Hence a dependence on artificial light , Well located but a little noisy Rooms well equipped and staff were helpful and friendly
254506,Hotel 82 London, although the bathroom was really clean the shower lacked pressure to be really comfortable 7 30 is a bit late for breakfast in a hotel, the room was big enough for the price nice closet to put your clothes in the bed was quite ok I ve had worse for this price great location with lots of good restaurants at walking distance
254507,Hotel 82 London, The bed was not double bed but only two single beds pushed together Quality of the matraces was shocking Got back ache from them Overall cleanliness wasn t good Dust everywhere Also hotel is using cellar tape to put up signs in the room Not clear whenow to check out as two signs in the room saying one check out at 11am and another one saying check out at 12pm ,No Positive
254508,Hotel 82 London, Bedroom curtains so thin that the lights in the fire escape stairs outside kept me awake Weak water pressure in showers of upstairs bedrooms Not enough tables in breakfast room for all guests Lumpy pillows some rooms only had one pillow Wifi access was cut off before I had checked out , Friendly and helpful staff Good location close to buses tube stations and some attractions Free wifi breakfast included 
254509,Hotel 82 London, I was a bit disappointed this time with the shower which was luke warm They sent an engineer to fix it right away and it appeared to be fixed But the next morning was the same It might just be that one room though 202 , Very good place I ve stayed here before 
254510,Hotel 82 London, When we came in there wasn t a cot for my daughter The next day they put one in and it was too small besides the fact that they didn t prepare the cot She ended up sleeping with us the whole time They insisted in giving 2 towels when we were 3 No cleaning services and the bath was more a cat bath than a real bath no water pressure at all , The reception team Michael and Alina and Rita from breakfast were 5 The hotel is really well located and the room had good space 
254511,Hotel 82 London, Breakfast Room limited in size so get down to it early to secure a table Otherwise a good place to stay with good access to Baker Street Tube and therefore the Jubilee Line which is quick to get you around the sites, Good size room and good ensuite facilities
254512,Hotel 82 London, Lift was very small Room was on 4th floor Lift slow Location was very good for Marylebone Station but we needed taxis for our theatre and exhibition trips , Good towels plenty of hot water Staff friendly and pleasant 
254513,Hotel 82 London, Unfortunately on this occasion I was given a single room on the side of the hotel which was beside a noisy ventilation shaft and access stairway The air conditioning was difficult to control and achieve a comfortable temperature in the room , The hotel is only 300 or so metres from Baker Street tube station and 100m from bus stops for the west east There was a reasonable choice for the hotel breakfast and plenty of it The hotel is very close to a number of good traditional London pubs most serving food 
254514,Hotel 82 London, Not sure how this compares with other hotels in London as have only ever have spent nights in two of them But I found the room very small and basic The shower could use a thorough clean with descaler the sink was clogged when we arrived got fixed immediately I have to say The curtains were flimsy and torn the fridge was wedged awkwardly in the wardrobe There was an odd discrepancy between nice and clean linen for example and a relatively new floor but other bits that were in need of upkeep , The location and the friendliness of the staff Perhaps as London rates go especially in the Marathon weekend it was on the more affordable side But I can t really judge that 
254515,Hotel 82 London, Matteress needed replacing room 404 2 singles used as a double One had large dip in middle Functions on shower didn t work Bath tap didn t function so you need shower to fill up bath Mouldy shower head attachment Towel rail hanging off wall seal in shower screen hanging off and mouldy Photos too follow Sash window wouldn t stay open as the mechanism broken could be potentially fatal Waited 20 minutes to be seated for breakfast was appalled by the amount of extension leads hanging from tables too accommodate high use of warming plates used surely a health safely issue Only had a 2 slice toaster in breakfast room for 15 people Major issue we had 2 large windows in our so called l superior room only one window had a blind so very bright come am, Food was ok
254516,Hotel 82 London, The room was dark with very little natural light It was badly maintained with a number of knobs missing off the cupboards and two bedside lamps with no plugs The bathroom was dirty and there was no plug in the sink and it was slow to drain The breakfast was dreadful Everything was tinned even the sausages hot dog sausage for breakfast is a new one on me , It was a very convenient location close to my meeting and other amenities 
254517,Hotel 82 London, The room needed some attention Firstly there were only voile window dressings fine during the day but in the evening when trying to sleep let light in from the street lamp outside the window and also when the sun rose so did we The room we had also faced the busy street and without decent double glazing the street noise combined with the lack of curtains meant we didn t get much sleep The bathroom while clean on the surface need a make over chipped items a tap that needed repairing and lots of limescale on the shower doors and around the taps etc and mould in the shower on the grouting There were wall lamps in the room that didn t work and the bedside lamps had USB leads but only one USB socket to plug it into So that s the room then onto breakfast Quite an experience and not in a positive way The hot food well the eggs and hash browns were OK but the sausages were tinned hot dog sausages the mushrooms were insipid and there wasn t any bacon at all Continental breakfast consisted of some plastic cheese squares slide cucumber and tomato and bizarrely egg mayonnaise sandwiches There were only two seat tables in the breakfast room which was in the basement difficult for the family of three that turned up while we were eating breakfast Coffee and tea were served from thermos flasks and orange juice and milk room temperature from jugs left on the side So overall not a great experience Overseas visitors please note not all UK hotels are like this , The location was ok 10 mins stroll from Baker St tube and not far from Marble Arch and Oxford Street The receptionist that greeted us was warm and friendly 
254518,Hotel 82 London, I had only one complaint on my visit to Hotel 82 I had requested twin beds on the booking form because my daughter who lives outside London was staying with me after a show in the city The request was not picked up and I had to push my request at the reception desk to get the twin beds , The location was perfect the room was clean and efficient and good value for money breakfast was in the basement and it was nicely presented 
254519,Hotel 82 London, The shower had a very low water flow rate I was on the second floor and there were 2 floors above me Maybe they could invest in a shower pump s , Location was great and staff friendly and helpful 
254520,Hotel 82 London, Shower very little water pressure Breakfast ok for a one night stay but wouldn t recommend it if you stay for more than 2 nights, Great central location Close to public transport links Reasonable sized room which was surprisingly quiet 
254521,Hotel 82 London, I am really fed up of these types of hotels that charge as if they are really good but they are actually cr p The sink was blocked the shower was so slow that it took a full half an hour to use the bed had a huge indentation in the mattress so that you couldn t actually sleep without getting a back ache the breakfast was awful people fighting over the small amounts on offer Avoid this hotel , Good location 
254522,Hotel 82 London, The bathroom was not clean and the shower was very calcified It was disgusting for me I regret that I didn t took myflipflops with me The breakfast wasn t delicious and fresh too little choice and not good presented The breakfast room is too small old fashioned and was not so clean , The bed was big an comfortable and the position of the hotel is very good The staff was friendly and the reception was open 24 h 
254523,Hotel 82 London, It was me and my partners first hotel so we didn t really know what we were doing and there was no welcome pack explaining things which would of been helpful Also it said on the door that for the reception dial 0 but there was no phone to do that with in the room so if we had a problem it would of been interesting The breakfast room was a little cramped , The staff we re really friendly and helpful The bed was really comfortable but the room was smaller than I thought it was going to be but it wasn t bad for what it was 
254524,Hotel 82 London, No toiletries in room on arrival No tea bags on second day to replace the ones I d used on first night and nothing to stir tea coffee with The shower door didn t close or seal properly resulting in the whole bathroom floor flooding The only window in the room was onto what I believed was an internal stairwell of the hotel so there was no window to open for fresh air As the stairwell was lit all night this left the room pretty much lit up too as the curtain was so thin , It was clean and the bed was comfortable Staff were friendly and did sort out the toiletries when asked 
254525,Hotel 82 London, The breakfast was good but it was served far to late 7 30 is to late most hotel start serving breakfast at 6 00 even 6 30 would do The last morning I had to leave the hotel by latest 7 30 so had to go without breakfast which is really annoying if it is included in the price when I arrived the lady at the reception was very unfriendly The bathroom was dirty the room tiny the internet did not work there was not a drinking glas the bedside lamp did not work I had asked for a room on an upper floor but was put in a room at the ground floor I think I can say it was the worst hotel I have ever been in the only good thing was the location ,No Positive
254526,Hotel 82 London, Very poor value for money and inaccurate inflated pricing on booking com in order to offer a high discount Rooms were fitted with cheap furnishings and very poorly maintained Hotel also had a smell from the kitchen , Location is positive as well as receptions staff however service ended there 
254527,Hotel 82 London, No real window in the room therefore very bad air no blinds at the so called windows to bright at night, Very good breakfast very friendly personnel clean rooms
254528,Hotel 82 London, Although this is not hotel s fault if you stay in a room next to the road there is a lot of traffic and other noise Just to give the heads up for those who appreciate silence request a room at the back of the hotel Slight maintenance can be done in room bathroom , Great location Small nice hotel few rooms simple cozy Friendly staff Good for a weekend stay in London Simple breakfast but contains everything 
254529,Hotel 82 London, Some fresh fruit at breakfast would have been nice There was no bar I didn t have a glass in my room The shower was a bit weak , The room was tastefully decorated The bed was comfortable and the breakfast good the location was excellent and at 81 for B B in central London I thought it was very good value for money 
254530,Hotel 82 London, The rooms have not dark curtains You sleep with the daylight Bathrooms are not nice The shower is poor the heating in the bathroom was not working The blanket on the bed is very light I suffered the cold Breakfast is basic The area is very nice but all the rest should be improved Bad quality price ratio ,No Positive
254531,Hotel 82 London, Strange room no phone to contact reception 2 doors onto balcony 1 blocked by bed the other without an opening key no fan in bathroom no drinking glasses Breakfast is also a strange affair some hot food but no meat We had to keep asking for more hash browns or eggs to be cooked as they weren t topped up We left our cases after check out so that we could explore London We went back to the hotel that evening to collect them and the receptionist didn t even look up They were in an unlocked cupboard and anyone could ve accessed them , Amazing location 
254532,Hotel 82 London, Secondary glazing inadequate given road noise Towel rail did not work even after reporting Shower worked though head looked dirty and bath tap did not work as whole thing seemed locked into one position Bedding had not been aired on arrival Only 1 tea bag each per day No biscuits Bed has seen better days and creaked at the end though we did manage to get some sleep Lift is 2 person but anyone of a more rounded disposition would have to use it alone as it was very tight Breakfast was suspect only skimmed milk cereals of uncertain origin and no warming plates for cooked food such as pancakes but toast was good and the room a little cramped if all the guests were there together , Location to meeting place very good TV worked fine Hot water available when needed 
254533,Hotel 82 London, I believe that this is a general problem of London but also applicable to this location Cleanness could be better Found old piece of soap at top of shower Shower had three options but only one was functioning change knob was not available and although change was requested shower had not been fixed as whished Room was generally clean Some equipment needed renovation as wallpaper and the shower equipment , This is a very good and non expensive location to be within London Baker Street is just next door so restaurant Pub and also small shop in short walking distance Super Room has been made on daily basis towels have been exchanged as wished Room is equipped with hair dryer water boiler and fridge English Breakfast was good normal days two variants of toast on sunday scoon 
254534,Hotel 82 London, Many things in the room were unfunctional or broken No light bulbs hard to open windows poor wifi on the 2nd floor The beds were unstable and of poor quality , Pretty good breakfast kind staff 
254535,Hotel 82 London, It s a wierd one there s so much potential but cleanliness was really poor the room hadn t been dusted in weeks and I found someone s false nail in the wardrobe The sheets also smelt of chlorine and some areas are in need of a face lift The worst bit was breakfast it was a crammed room dingy and poor quality food Definitely not worth the price I paid, It s a pretty hotel with good decor and a nice receptionist
254536,Hotel 82 London, No one in the straff was really unfriendly but they were not really interested in thier guests och could not give ANY advice about anything Location resturants taxi how to get to the airport etc They kind a looked bored of their job One guy working the night shift was very friendly fun and helpful thoug , I absolutley loved the simple british breakfast Rooms was good size been to much smaller rooms in London before this room was perfect for the price Location was good 
254537,Hotel 82 London, we didn t manage to get up in time for breakfast so no review on that but the only they that I would say desperately needs changing is the lift we struggled to get two of us in and our two bags although four floors is not far to walk up and down after a long day of travelling and carrying belongings the lift was needed , for the price of the room and the short stay we went for the size on the room was just right some would probably say small but there was plenty or room for all of our stuff and room to get ready super clean super comfy super location staff we lovely very welcoming and made checking in easy 
254538,Hotel 82 London, No instructions for the shower so many buttons to press, Needed an affordable room to stay in central London didn t disappoint Staff were welcoming and room was nice
254539,Hotel 82 London, Room was not made over on second day although towels were replenished This may have been due to a misunderstanding as I was working in room when domestic staff came round and I think they didn t understand what I said to them language problem Wifi in room was a slow connection that kept failing Indifferent breakfast no bacon cheap and unpleasant sausages and baked beans , Basement room was very quiet and peaceful Bed was large and comfortable Our room and public areas in the hotel were spotlessly clean Receptionist friendly and helpful 
254540,Hotel 82 London, The cleaners left the window open letting in the rain and wind thus the room was wet and cold when I arrived it was difficult to get it warm The curtains did not block out the light The secondary glazing did not block out the street noise The shower control was stuck so I could not have a bath to warm up The towel radiator did not work Some of the lights did not work Its no good starting breakfast at 7 30 when you have business clientele who need an early start , The hapless girl on reception was trying to be helpful Breakfast was adequate 
254541,Hotel 82 London, Breakfast room is rather cramped however plenty of choice Lift was very small room for one person and a case or 2 people no cases Use the stairs , The room was clean and tidy the reception staff were welcoming and knowledgeable about the area Great for Madame Toussards and Oxford Street walking distance 
254542,Hotel 82 London, Very tiny rooms Breakfast very basic poor selection tasty coffee helped , Clean daily serviced room Great location Good value if you are able to get a special offer 
254543,Hotel 82 London, 1 Really small room 2 The bed for two people is actually made of two small beds 3 Mattress was broken 4 If you don t specify they may also give you basement room , British breakfast offered 
254544,Hotel 82 London, The sink was filthy the water wouldn t go down and brought up a lot of disgusting smelling gunk from the pipe Our bin in the bathroom hadn t been emptied before our stay Finally we didn t get any sleep whatsoever due to a loud banging noise which continued all night We couldn t find where it was coming from during the night and when asked about it in the morning the man at the front desk seemed to know exactly what we were talking about Incredibly disappointed , The hotel was in a good location 
254545,Hotel 82 London, There was no information that singe room does not have a window If I knew it at the moment of reservation I would book double room and make sure that it has a window This the only problem I had with the hotel but for me it was actually huge disadvantage , Location good breakfast small but comfortable room nice staff
254546,Hotel 82 London, Breakfast was a bit strange Expected English breakfast but there was no bacon and there were some halved chipolata tinned sausages and crepes were cold , The bed was extremely comfortable with great pillows Regarding breakfast that was a really strange meal There was scrambled egg fried egg tomatoes hash browns tinned mushrooms and baked beans in bain maries together with the odd halved chipolata tinned sausages Plenty of cereals toast cheese fruit etc and crepes so didn t go hungry was just a bit strange 
254547,Hotel 82 London, Rooms G03 and 103 do not have any curtains or blackout only decorative voile Therefore even though it s an internal facing window it lets a lot of light in The bathrooms could also benefit from some maintenance , Location is good 
254548,Hotel 82 London, Booked 2 rooms same price but completely different experience friends room single bed and by stairwell my room king size bed, Room large and comfortable
254549,Hotel 82 London, My room had a window by the stairwell which illuminated the room all night plus everytime someone went up or down the stairs I was woken, Location but the best thing was the staff so friendly and helpful
254550,Hotel 82 London, I d like to stay again and be able to book in advance at the same rate Unfortunately the hotel only adds rooms 3 4 weeks in advance and demands premium rates for such short notice Discounts for booking in advance please and room only no breakfast , Location is great Comfortable bed 
254551,Hotel 82 London, The shower looked like it was going to be amazing but wasn t powerful at all , The d cor was lovely great facilities and really comfy bed TV had plenty of channels Staff were also really friendly and the location was ideal 
254552,Hotel 82 London,No Negative, good hotel very comfortable clean room good breakfast very kind the guy at reception alessandro Italian who gave us lots of useful information to get around london
254553,Hotel 82 London, The guy on reception did not appear to know what he was doing The room had a cheap DIY feel about it Bargain basement toilet paper Coffee was awful Luckily I bought my own Toiletries were cheap The bed was too big for the room The room had a fridge with nothing in it No complimentary bottle of water no mini bar What is the point of that other than to make a noise and disturb my sleep The view from my room was the verse end of other buildings The guy that checked me out was the most unfriendly hotel staff I ve ever come across The so called English breakfast was terrible No bacon non meat sausages no fried egg Definitely will not stay here again For a little more I can stay in the wonderful Durrants Hotel around the corner, I could open the bedroom window and the bed was quite comfortable
254554,Hotel 82 London, The girls at reception were ok enough but didn t greet you unless you spoke to them first They kind of looked at you as to ask what you wanted to check in of course but were lovely once they got you sorted The breakfast was in such a small tiny room that had all us guests cramped together No bacon or sausages to be seen at the buffet but an otherwise good range of breakfast things eggs beans hash browns tomatoes mushrooms toast french toast cereal yoghurt etc The woman hosting breakfast was super moody to everyone though Ah well you get what you pay for and she wasn t unpleasant at breakfast , It is brilliantly close to Baker Street underground and also within short walking distance to the Sherlock Holmes museum The room was just what you needed for a couple staying in London for one night a room with a bed and a telly and a nice size bathroom too Some folks might find the room small but if you re there to sleep then it s all good The bed was huge and really lovely and comfy Lots of plug sockets for the gadgets including a USB port Stylish room very clean 
254555,Hotel 82 London, Asked for twin bed but allocated a double The duvet was thin and I was cold The traffic noise went on until the early hours so got a poor nights sleep , The hotel is ideally placed for visiting the main attractions Most things are within walking distance The hotel is basic and clean Good choice for breakfast 
254556,Hotel 82 London, They only list their rooms as available on Booking com 1 month of so in advance and at high rates I would like to stay again but booking in advance to secure a great rate , Good location friendly staff
254557,Hotel 82 London, During our stay the bathroom was not cleaned properly At breakfast table cloth were dirty , Great location Friendly and helpful staff Comfortable lobby
254558,Hotel 82 London, No facilities breakfast stating too late at 7 30 Breakfast cold eggs overdone TV at 7 30 am on music channel No flexibility to cancel after one night Never go back very disappointing, Very good but deceptive pictures 
254559,Hotel 82 London, Customers need to specify in the order No basement room otherwise this possibility does exist Some rooms though are priced the same but quite differ in roominess Some rooms are really small , Good location 5mins walk to Baker street and well situated in an area of restaurants and supermakets Warm and kind hearted staff Good quality breakfast with diverse offers 
254560,Hotel 82 London, Shower was terrible just a dribble Breakfast was mostly vegetarian with what looked like chicken sausages and rubbery scrambled egg , Position was great I had a room to the rear which was very quiet Room was simple with a touch of bling 24 hr reception 
254561,Hotel 82 London, Everything was good although the shower was a little temperamental and the hot breakfast wasn t as good as the continental breakfast selection, Location was so great friendly staff small but nicely decorated room 
254562,Hotel 82 London, The rooms are starting to look tired and the shower did not work particularly well no toiletries provided drinking glasses missing etc Cleanliness was OK but could have been better Room was quite cramped and the tea coffee making facilities were incomplete , The location is perfect for my business needs as well as proximity to restaurants and facilities
254563,Hotel 82 London, Room 403 needed maintenance bedside table lamp not working air con not working knob missing from fire towel holder in bathroom coming loose hairdryer holder broken and water pressure not great Breakfast poor tea coffee from flasks no fruit and only bran flakes corn flakes for cereals Hot food and salad type food as well , The bed was very good as was the lounge downstairs with TV and Nespresso machine
254564,Hotel 82 London, The door is kept closed and one have to ring the bell Could be left open especially during day , Close to main streets like Oxford and BAker Street Metro 5 minute walk and near quite good and cheap restaurants 
254565,Hotel 82 London, Staff seemed disinterested maybe because most of them barely spoke English The room was MUCH smaller than the pictures there was only just room for the double bed Also when we checked in the room was not ready no pillowcases on the pillows no towels etc The breakfast though good was served in a very small and crowded room , The hotel had a good central location at walking distance from Oxford Street Baker Street and the Underground Both the bedroom and bathroom were very clean Breakfast included was pretty good 
254566,Hotel 82 London, Bathrooms terrible showers etc, Random week before we went to make sure we had rooms with window put in the basement which was absolutely terrible the floors were not clean the bathroom was so bad we even had HAIRS ON THE FLOOR and not from the head they did over us but very disappointed would not recommend BATHROOMS NEED SERIOUS ATTENTION
254567,Hotel 82 London, Found black hair in bed Also paid for a double futon for our twins and got a single put u up bed and was charged 130 pounds The breakfast was long life milk how much etc would it cost for fresh milk , Location was good but feel like they don t care much about anything else as they will always get guests
254568,Hotel 82 London, Room was cold this was a particularly cold time of the year with a freezing fog all day Towel rail in the bathroom was also cold bathroom felt cold Double glazing in our room was faulty so traffic noise was loud we were facing a main road perhaps quieter at the back of the hotel Not a lot of choice for breakfast, Room was clean and had everything that you could need Very close to tube station and easy to walk to key London attractions especially those around the west end Small hotel no noise problems from any nearby rooms Staff were pleasant and allowed us to store luggage after we had checked out
254569,Hotel 82 London, Room 202 No remote for the television couldn t be bother to go down stairs complain Shower didn t work correctly Bed side lights didn t work properly no lock on bathroom door, Location of hotel

254571,Hotel 82 London, Room s heating only starts up when you are in the room so in the winter you have to wait 40 50 minutes in the cold Large bundle of laundry left outside lift for over 24 hours making corridor narrow in case of fire , Friendly staff if not very helpful 
254572,Hotel 82 London, Larger room in basement so check re that when you reserve We were mostly out so it didn t matter much but it wasn t someplace you d want to hang around in particularly Small irritations such as Keys needed to be re keyed almost every evening which meant going up and down to desk each time at the end of the day People were very nice but somehow never resolved things for more than the moment didn t remember the issue the next day Had to go back up to ask for blankets a second time after the guy had come down to determine the heat wasn t working etc , Great location and good kitchenette relaxed 
254573,Hotel 82 London, we have booked superior double room but they gave us double room the second day we complained and they gave us superior room also there weren t any map of city, very good position only 1 xiliometre from oxford street near to baker station the stuff very kindly 
254574,Hotel 82 London, Gloucester Place is a very busy and noisy road from early morning until late at night The heating and plumbing in the hotel needs some attention , Easy access to the centre of London and plenty of local shops and restaurants 
254575,Hotel 82 London, Single room was an inside room although did have a window onto stairs for light No chair or table in room although there was plenty room for a small table and chair Would have asked for one if I had been there more than one night , Staff were welcoming and helpful Quiet 
254576,Hotel 82 London,No Negative, The room was pretty much everything you needed very clean and could change the heating to suite our needs The price was so good for the location also less than 5 minutes walk to Oxford Street and Baker Street tube station 
254577,Hotel 82 London, Room G03 that I stayed in had net curtains but no blackout curtains This was a problem because outside my room was a large white emergency light that needed to remain on all through the night As a result it was like trying to sleep in broad daylight Awful , The location was ideal for catching the train from Marylebone the next morning Breakfast was simple but tasty and the room was clean 
254578,Hotel 82 London, I stayed in room G02 The shower cubicle is disgusting Years of grime around the doors and down the side The shower head itself was clogged with scale and slime The bathroom sink was blocked and so back filled with water and dirt The bed is awful Two single beds put together One really lumpy and the other with a big sunken part in the middle Clearly very old and knackered The duvet was so thin it was more of a sheet I had to double it over for warmth as you can t sleep with the fan on as it s too noisy You can t also hear when the room above flushes their toilet chain It sounds like water is actually pouring into the room The tea and coffee making facility was a couple of cheap branded tea bags and a cup that was dirty and smelled of floor cleaner For 20 more I could have stayed in a Premier Inn which would have been spotless and comes with a good night guarantee , I was on the ground floor which as a solo traveler felt safe However the door to G02 doesn t lock and there s an attic access hatch no lock or bolt on it opening into the bathroom which was a bit unnerving The female receptionist was lovely and friendly The male receptionist was surly 
254579,Hotel 82 London, tea and coffee were poor had to go buy our own breakfast wasnt great but was a decent selection not all the lights worked in the room and our blinds were ripped and broken, good location very central staff were great very friendly and helpful rooms were clean and tidy

254582,Hotel 82 London, The rooms were small and the breakfast room very crowded But the breakfast was ok , The staff was very helpful The rooms were clean and the location was great 
254583,Hotel 82 London, When I was sleeping in the midnight in my room someone opened the door and tried to get in even Card Key equipped I shouted them in English then they were going away The following day I found out my Key Code was re registered I could not use original key I reported it to receptionist when I was checking out but she seemed not to care about that Unbeliebable ,No Positive
254584,Hotel 82 London,No Negative, Although the room was a bit small opening the wardrobe door was awkward because the bed was so close it had everything it needed and was decorated nicely The shower was excellent and nice big towels Breakfast was a little quirky usual cooked options and cereal as well as cold waffles and pannetone 
254585,Hotel 82 London, Horrible beds not comfortable at all too soft Very noisy even at night Air conditionning was noisy not working properly so it was either too cold or too hot, Great location in the heart of london very friendly staff

254587,Hotel 82 London, the room we had was very cold all the time and the cold air was coming inside the room from everywhere In general the cleaning was not the best and the lighting in the room was very dim , Location was perfect Around the corner from Baker Street with so many facilities and coffee shops room size was quite good compared to other rooms you find in central London Breakfast was included in the room rate and was really very good Free Nespresso machine at the lounge in the hotel entrance was also great 
254588,Hotel 82 London, Nothing to add, The hotel was very clean and warm The room was a good size with plenty of sockets USB ports and storage The bathroom was a good size and very clean The mattress was a bit lumpy but I still slept well I didn t have breakfast but it was available included in the price Great location for shopping on Oxford street 
254589,Hotel 82 London, The double bed was two singles which made it quite uncomfy at night falling down the gap in the middle There was only 3 tea bags in the room which was pretty annoying The towels were dirty and needed changing when we got there The blind didn t shut fully The breakfast room was so over crowded it was not a pleasant experience no bacon or sausage The water pressure was terrible , The location was perfect and the staff were very friendly and helpful Was initially put off by a few bad reviews I m not an unrealistic person I am aware you will get what you pay for especially in the centre of London Expect friendly staff a great location but BASIC facilities 
254590,Hotel 82 London, Reception was unattended when I arrived with a note and phone number Calling the number just made the phone on the reception desk ring and it was not answered Had to wait 10mins or so for somebody to return which was not great after a long journey and had to get changed and get to function fairly swiftly I saw the same note a few other times passing reception so appeared fairly common , Clean and comfy room Friendly staff Good location easy walk to Oxford Street Hyde Park and Mayfair
254591,Hotel 82 London, My room nearly cleaning room we hear night noise how work wash mashine, Nearly oxford street 10minut walk to shopping street friendly small room but very clean nice breakfest
254592,Hotel 82 London, Rooms were a bit worn out and could have used a little more detailed cleaning , Lovely service when complained about the noisy room and got moved to the other side of the hotel to a wonderfully quiet room Breakfast was surprisingly diverse in London standards Location was good walking distance from Oxford Street 
254593,Hotel 82 London, The multispray shower had a feeble single jet with just adequate hot water The duvet was child thin Apart from sandwich roll a meatless breakfast with a flask of quickly refilled coffee that tasted of instant so I left ate breakfast in town We had breakfast at a restaurant on Baker St the next day , Location comfortable bed room
254594,Hotel 82 London,No Negative, The room was small but it had everything you needed in it so can t complain The location was fine it s a 5 minute walk to Baker St tube station The staff were grand friendly The breakfast was ok the sausages weren t nice they were those hotdog ones There s a nice room behind reception to chill out in watch TV there s free Nespreso coffee cookies Oh and the lift is very small myself and my husband fit in but it s a tight squeeze 
254595,Hotel 82 London, The hotel is on a very busy road right next to traffic lights and it is so noisy at all hours I literally used tissue as makeshift ear plugs The double bed was 2 singles pushed together Breakfast was poor quality , Shower was good and the staff were friendly and helpful Iron was very good quality 
254596,Hotel 82 London, Guy at reception was quite rude luckily ladies were the opposite The sink pipe was nearly blocked but they didn t do anything during our stay to fix it despite asking for it several times Very small rooms and not airy , Location
254597,Hotel 82 London, the room wasn t cleaned during our stay and on one day the cups weren t washed and no refills of tea and coffee put in room Rooms are very small and dining room also small Breakfast was not appealing, modern decor and staff were friendly and helpful
254598,Hotel 82 London, I stayed in 200 hotels good and bad luxury and simple And this hotel is the worst in my list Let s start with the thing that you cannot easily enter the room bad is located very close to entrance and prevents door to be fully opened see photo No hot water in shower We complained about it to reception and a plumber came after 10PM Good thing that he fixed and issue but it was the only one good thing during our stay Blocked drain in sink see photo broken furniture see photo Only one shower towel in double room for two persons didn t even look like a big disaster WiFi didn t work properly it asks to enter username password and after that fails with Host not resolved message Still you can load a web page if you reload it 10 15 times but I wouldn t call it working WiFi Never ever it s a hobo jungle not a hotel in center of London , Great location close to Hyde Park Baker street and other location in City of Westminster Good breakfast

254601,Hotel 82 London, We booked a superior room for three and when we arrived to the hotel we got the information that our room was in the basement Obviously all three bed rooms are there This wasn t mentioned anywhere The third bed was moore like an tentbed not a proper bed The room was clean but they had forgot to clean the toilet seat Old beds with little filling had to ask for an extra blanket to put over the madrass to not feel the steel coming through Small breakfast room every morning they had problems to fit the quests in , Great location kind staff 
254602,Hotel 82 London, We asked for a quiet room as we had a business meeting the following day we were given a room at the front of the hotel we may as well have been sleeping in the street the traffic started just after 4 am so noisy very disappointed and shattered we stay in London every 2 weeks we will never stay here again,No Positive
254603,Hotel 82 London, The elevator was EXTREMELY small barely could fit two persons WiFi in the bedroom was only accessible just inside the main door not accessible in the bed area Dirty cups The bathroom basin was blocked full of hair No drinkable water in the whole hotel staff suggested us to drink from the basin s faucet , Nice rich breakfast included in the room rate large bed very good heating system 
254604,Hotel 82 London, bathroom was dirty smell of damp extractor van did not work toilet seat loose problems with the blind curtains in the room lights on the bedside tables did not work only very small bin in the bathroom no bin in the room, the bed was comfortable staff attentive excellent location for Oxford street and Baker street able to leave luggage after checking out

254607,Hotel 82 London, The breakfast was well below par No butter for the toast and the English breakfast was poor No bacon and the orange juice tasted watered down, Clean modern style bedroom with easy access to Baker Street station
254608,Hotel 82 London, Why is this called a hotel in the first place and in addition to that one with four stars Just because the receptions is in his chair all night The rooms are nice but with Ikea furniture It s terribly cold because there is only an electrical heater and the windows are not well insulated and there is no light and cold protecting curtain The breakfast is pathetic , The staff in the breakfast room was very kind The location is ok 
254609,Hotel 82 London, Tweaks in the bathroom e g towel holder by the sink soap holder in the shower etc , Breakfast is brilliant and staff were friendly Low noise levels Spacious room and bathroom powershower awesome Wifi pretty good Great location 
254610,Hotel 82 London, The room was sparsely furnished with just a bed and a small bedside unit The bathroom was definitely tired many of the tiles were cracked as was the sink which had no plug The shower door didn t close properly and leaked It was described as a boutique hotel but I have had much better and more comfortable rooms in the budget chains, On the plus side the hotel was very convenient for stations and underground the guy on the desk was friendly and helpful and the bed was comfy
254611,Hotel 82 London,No Negative, to the price okay rooms small but fine and ok beds new tv with lots of channels No minibar but a refrigerator so you can buy in yourself and off course coffee and the maker at the room Breakfast typical English and well done Wifi was also functional in the rooms 
254612,Hotel 82 London, Dining room cramped breakfast average small shower and some damage wobbly taps loose wardrobe door etc , Good location clean and reasonable value Large comfy bed
254613,Hotel 82 London, Elevator extremely small Breakfast very poor most of the food ran out by 09h30 although breakfast was supposed to be until 10h00 Had to request more food and coffee and had to wait , Great shopping location Close to main high streets of London 
254614,Hotel 82 London, The dining room is small When we arrived downstairs at 9am we just had to wait a moment whilst a table was cleared A lady who came down a few minutes later had to wait longer The bathroom was a little grubby around the edges Not enough milks sugars in the tea making area so had to replenish , Comfy room and bed Internet TV good My son soon sorted it out It was a bit cool at night and I couldn t be bothered trying to sort out the Air Con as there was a wall mounted thermostat controlled heater which we used to good effect instead Decent breakfast A good range of cooked continental Staff pleasant and happy to replenish foodstuffs 
254615,Hotel 82 London, Rubbish from previous guest still in bin Electric shower rather than main shower meant poor pressure and heat Cold room with switch on electric radiator Air con had a fault unable to use, Unable to open door without ramming door against bed Had to slide in sideways and lift up bed to open door
254616,Hotel 82 London, Booked a double room at this hotel because it was closed to Marylebone Train Station which was very convenient But good thing we only stayed one night because the experience wasn t a good one Overall the place was a really small and cramped place the room was the tiniest room we have ever seen in an hotel imagine a room as narrow as a double bed and 2 nightstands where the bed was literally next to the entrance door At a first glace the room looked ok but then looking closely we ve noticed dust on the nightstands windows very old and dirty had even toilet paper in between so they could stay closed and then in the bathroom the tap sink had limescale residues and the shower looked too gross the shower caps were full of brownish residues as well as all around the shower and door frames We were too disgusted to even take a shower At a 4 stars hotel we would expect the bathroom to be spotless let s face it there are really good and not expensive bathroom cleaning solutions out there so that is no excuse what so ever Next morning we made our way to the basement in a small room obviously at this point where the breakfast area was 7 tables made the place too crowded and tight as people could barely walk around The food was just poor you could feel you are eating cheap food so not impressed at all I wouldn t book here again this didn t feel and looked like a 4 stars hotel at all I recommend adding around 40 more and book a room to a prestigious hotel The distances are not that big anyway between Marylebone and City Center so you could have a nice walk around and enjoy the beautiful London , Good location and comfortable bed 
254617,Hotel 82 London, We slept in one of the rooms in the basement and you could hear a door banging constantly through the night, Great location 5 10 mins walk away from Baker Street underground comfy bed
254618,Hotel 82 London, Long journey to get a second blanket with cover for each of the 3 rooms , Small but nice Helpful people Employees are slightly overloaded during breakfast time but always friendly
254619,Hotel 82 London, Size of room Dirty shower No daylight, Hotel was good and staff were nice but the room was very small with no daylight Bathroom wasn t much better and shower wasn t very clean
254620,Hotel 82 London, There is a fridge in the room it would be easy and nice to put a couple of bottles of water in there The breakfast room in the basement is a bit claustrophobic and impersonal There were no staff at the dining room door to meet me Maybe its just me but a nice good morning a smile and a little explanation of how it works would have been welcome as would real sausages instead of those horrible tinned ones , Trying to find a hotel in central ish London that costs less than a Kings ransom is difficult I chose this hotel for its location close to Marylebone Station and its price I wasn t there for a holiday just a convenient overnight after a work do It was OK probably what you d expect at this price point The main thing was that the room was clean contained everything that was needed and the bed was comfortable I actually slept quite well despite the constant road noise outside 
254621,Hotel 82 London, rooms are tidy on the first sight but the infrastructure really is just made to look nice it is very old and rusty chalky in the bathroom for example , so far a nice breakfast but as usual in London all on very narrow space and with very limited selections available 
254622,Hotel 82 London, The breakfast could have had more selections of cereal and pastries The milk was not cold nether were the juice , The hotel was in a good location and the rooms were clean and you to date on the decor
254623,Hotel 82 London, street facing room was a little noisy , Well located for my business trip close to Oxford Street too Tech gadgets in the room for recharging phones etc was a highlight 
254624,Hotel 82 London, The shower wasn t very good and there was only one large shower towel even though the room was for two people There were no glasses for water and the taps only really supplied warm or hot water The only other things we weren t the biggest fans of was that the lift could only really fit one person in luckily we are both quite small and also the breakfast could have been slightly better It was wasn t bad considering the price of hotels in central London We wouldn t rule out booking again but would possibly look elsewhere beforehand , The location was really good and close to the underground local restaurants and it was walking distance to Oxford Street We only stayed one night but was impressed with the finish of the room it had a modern feel and was located on the top floor overlooking the rooftops of London It was also fairly quiet even though we had a front facing room which was requested 
254625,Hotel 82 London, The bathroom shower was a little dated but overall this was a nice hotel On a par with some bigger 4 star hotels , The room was very clean and very attractive Nice furnishings plenty of room in the little hallway too plus a fridge This is a lovely area of London near to Baker Street and some nice restaurants 
254626,Hotel 82 London, room was so small At the 1st floor there is no window Also bathroom was so tiny and small , location was good Very close to Baker Street Tube and Marble Arch Tube station 
254627,Hotel 82 London, This hotel is NOT a 4 stars hotel Room are not clean We have found Pubes and hairs on the bed and the toilet seat bathroom are not fully function somewhere is not working When we arrived one staff was not friendly looks like lazy not wake up and we asked him if we can put ours baggage he said we don t have baggage room only put it in lobby How after we found out they have a baggage room in basement No wifi signal in room if u wanna use it u need stand behind the room door , Good location one stuff is very friendly Breakfast was ok but only start from 7 30 
254628,Hotel 82 London, The elevator can only fit about one person so it is hard to handle luggage when arriving and checking out , Location is perfect Just a block away from Baker Street and a five minute walk to Baker Street tube station A perfect place to start exploring the city from 
254629,Hotel 82 London, Internet was veeery slow the room looked better on the picture in reality the design is from 80s 90s no shampoo or gel in bath location is 10 min from tube , Breakfast was good hotel has luggage storage room
254630,Hotel 82 London, Breakfast cold Rooms rarely cleaned to a good standard On more than one occasion room not cleaned at all Asked to speak to a manager about housekeeping and was told not available email, Location
254631,Hotel 82 London, No coffee sachets in the room asked at reception and none there either Not impressed that their policy is to scan your credit card if you don t have photo ID, Immaculately clean room with a lovely comfy bed ideally situated for central london 
254632,Hotel 82 London, We wanted to leave our luggage on the final day Room v small and we were concerned about how secure it was Only a small negative The rest was really good , Great location here for honeymoon theatre visit and US embassy visa visit Breakfasts excellent Rooms clean Staff helpful 
254633,Hotel 82 London, Despite serving cooked breakfast had no red brown sauce the next day they didn t even get any in Didn t restock tea coffee in room or toiletries in the shower , Friendly staff 
254634,Hotel 82 London, The A C was working the first night and did not work for the second The room an bathroom are small I booked a triple for the size I found out it was in the basement When I expressed my readiness to move to a double room but move above ground it was agreed at no discount to the triple room price , Bed was comfortable and room was clean 
254635,Hotel 82 London, The price was too expensive for what we got More teabags and biscuits in the room would have been nice Wasnt much to do in the hotel to relax Breakfast was very basic although very nice The shower head fell off in our bathroom and the floor was filthy when we arrived, The room was nice
254636,Hotel 82 London, Did not like that the superior single came with a huge double bed Both sides of the bed were worn out Apart from a bedside table there was no space for other furniture , Staff tried their best to serve too many guests in the small breakfast room 
254637,Hotel 82 London, Barely enough room to walk past the foot of the bed without colliding with the wall mounted TV WiFi signal rarely available in room Scant attention paid to room on penultimate day of stay , Good air conditioning that kept the room cool on hot nights Modern fittings that worked properly Quiet room at the back of the hotel A really comfortable bed Plenty of breakfast Friendly staff 
254638,Hotel 82 London, Lift very small Full English breakfast didn t include bacon or sausages, Staff very friendly and helpful Great location near Oxford Street and Hyde Park Lots of restaurants nearby

254640,Hotel 82 London, Had to remind maid to replenish soap and TP Could have cleaned the room a little better AC didn t always work, Excellent location Very friendly and helpful staff Able to rent a cell phone for 2pounds a day Good breakfast
254641,Hotel 82 London, No bacon for breakfast and the tea could have been hotter and stronger , Didn t try the croissants but the bed was very comfy and big We liked the room wonderful to come back to after tramping the London tourist attractiions all day Was just sad we could only stay for one night but we will definitely stay longer at your hotel when we visit the city again 
254642,Hotel 82 London, Breakfast was cold and not nice Very noisy could hear all the traffic Paid for superior room but was very basic, The girl at reception was very pleasant and helpful
254643,Hotel 82 London, The shower is very strange The cleanness of the bath room was not vey good And also the dust on the furniture inside the room , The staff was very kind The location is really wonderfull 
254644,Hotel 82 London, There was quite a lot of noise and this disturbed my sleep one of the nights mornings Breakfast was very understaffed and you need to queue for a table Once you have a table you then need to wait a very long time for food At the beginning of our stay this was a really problem But at the end it seemed to be working a little better The problem really was understaffing because the lady working the breakfast table somehow managed to keep her calm and was wonderful despite being pulled in a thousand directions , Location was great the room was reasonably comfortable the staff were helpful and the price was reasonable for London 
254645,Hotel 82 London, The rooms were very hot and stuffy yet the traffic noise outside was so bad that having a window open was just not an option It made it very tricky to sleep The bathrooms did not seem to have been cleaned very well and the shower was very small with poor drainage It did not seem like a comfortable place to stay at all , The location is fantastic and check in staff were friendly It s very close to Baker Street tube station and lots of restaurants 
254646,Hotel 82 London, Breakfast was disappointing We sat down and were asked what we wanted for drinks I have a caffeine intolerance so I asked for caffeine free tea The reply I got was Yes but I ll have to go upstairs for that So I felt a bit of an inconvinence after that She returned with an espresso Which is quite the opposite So instead of saying anything I helped myself to the fresh orange juice There was little choice of food We got asked what we wanted without having seen a menu our choice was scrambled or fried eggs They came on a small plate with nothing else I asked for toast to accompany this and we were given one slice each , The room was lovely But on the fourth floor at the lift was broken 
254647,Hotel 82 London, The first morning there was a waiting line for breakfast as the hotel was fully booked , Proximity of the tube with 4 or 5 lines accessible in 5 minutes by walk The staff is very nice 
254648,Hotel 82 London, Don t have a front bedroom as no double glazing so very noisy Wifi very weak in back bedrooms , Staff location close to Underground easy walk to Oxford street buffet breakfast tea coffee facilities in room 
254649,Hotel 82 London, Cramped room tiny Lack of basic toiletries and shower cap in bathroom Narrow door into shower had to squeeze in and we are slim Shower flow weak Tv didn t work no signal Coffee making facilities inside wardrobe too dark to see Not a good idea to have a steaming kettle inside a wardrobe No teaspoon supplies of tea and coffee absolutely minimal Not enough for two cups Hairdryer old fashioned type fixed to the wall fell apart in use Buffet breakfast not available until 7 30 am despite 24 7 staff we had an early appointment in London Horrible view from window All in all very disappointing and hugely overpriced Could not recommend Poor value, Clean and fresh bed quiet room Pleasant welcome on arrival 
254650,Hotel 82 London, The ridiculous state of affairs for check in where I had to provide photo ID and proof of address even though I had pre paid and was a citizen of the UK Shower facilities were of a poor standard Will never stay at this hotel again , Good size of the room and location 
254651,Hotel 82 London, Everything but the breakfast was a bit of a disaster Bed was uncomfortable Front desk staff were useless Cleaners seemed overworked due to lack of numbers You can hear a fly fart three floors away Embarrasing security got to my room without any locks or people to get through Room was not ready on arrival about 11 30 despite our early check in request Wifi was unusable , Breakfast was good 
254652,Hotel 82 London, Room was stuffy Hair dryer broken Tried the four in a bed dust test on a picture frame it failed miserable Shower required a good clean as shower head not working to best ability Breakfast unimpressed Would not stay again,No Positive
254653,Hotel 82 London, Nothing , I like the helpful staff and very good accomodation My kids liked the hotel and they asked me to come again only in this hotel The breakfast very nice for all My wife liked the location 
254654,Hotel 82 London, The breakfasts were the worst we have ever encountered On Monday morning we queued for over 10 minutes just to be able to share a table with another guest There was hardly any food left There was no milk no yoghurt no cheese just a few scraps of cucumber and tomato There was no menu eventually the waitress said that we could have eggs mushrooms and green beans adding sausages later If requested toast was available but only the cheapest white sort Tea was dispensed from a teapot that clearly was carried from table to table using the same teabag The following day was slightly better but still scarcely believable The man on reception shrugged his shoulders and gave the impression that this was not an unusual occurrence The shower in the bathroom was rusty and the supposed side jets did not actually reach your body There were used unwashed cups left from the previous resident , There was nothing that is worth commenting on 
254655,Hotel 82 London, Breakfast room could have had smaller tables for two people Most people travel in couples then they could have fitted more people in for breakfast rather have some people standing in the corridor waiting for an empty table very off putting , very impress with the hotel staff breakfast and location
254656,Hotel 82 London, The door of my room couldn t be locked from the inside which wasn t a problem as the staff knocks on the door before entering The door of my bathroom couldn t be locked which wasn t a problem for me , Very nice staff they made me feel welcome and made my stay extra pleasant Breakfast was fresh made on the spot 
254657,Hotel 82 London, There wasn t a proper full English breakfast no bacon or sausages but there was other options that were sufficient , The staff were friendly and went out of their way for us The hotel was modern and clean and in a great location for our needs 
254658,Hotel 82 London, It is absolutely not a 4 stars No fire evacuation plan in the room Cleaning of the bathroom is ambiguous Breakfast is limited and not good , Localization
254659,Hotel 82 London, The location wasn t great in terms of getting around on the tube but that was my fault for not checking out how near it was to where I needed to be The bin in my bathroom was full and the toilet seat was up so I wondered if it had been thoroughly cleaned although everywhere looked clean , Friendly staff and nice breakfast which was included in the room rate The room was a good size Overall it was value for money considering the extortionate London hotel rates
254660,Hotel 82 London, The breakfast was a real let down woke up expecting something like a good English breakfast but was met with cold scrambled eggs no bacon or sausages and part toasted toast Back to the room for a shower and found the shower to hardly work at all which was a shame as it looks like it might be a nice power shower , The rooms were very nice clean and comfy and the hotel was situated perfectly for us to tour round London 
254661,Hotel 82 London, Room G03 is truly awful There are no windows except glazing into an internal lobby that meant you couldn t get a dark room Its one of the smallest rooms I ve ever been given and I booked as a business traveler but there is no desk as there is no desk or chair in the room The bathroom is tiny and the steps to the shower are downright dangerous I ve gotten wetter in the rain compared to the shower All in all very poor value for money and not for the business traveler , The receptionist was friendly and the room was clean
254662,Hotel 82 London, There was dust under the cofee table skirting boards on and behind side cabinets and lots of dust under the bed Some pants and socks inside one of the draws from previous guests Staff should check those We have mentioned that cleaners should be doing a better job but the 2 girls at reception gave us some dirty looks Curtains in the room need to be thicker as they let a lot of light in At breakfast time staff were not organised at all , I liked the scrumbled eggs and mushrooms at breakfast even though I had to wait for the toast 
254663,Hotel 82 London, The breakfast is not big but is enough with nice food , Great place with friendly staff There are also good WiFi and mobile phones in the rooms with some apps in it some kind of a service but we didn t use them 
254664,Hotel 82 London, Small bathroom with very cosy shower, Breakfast was made to order but could have had a better selection of bread available Nice bedding good central location 
254665,Hotel 82 London, The Wi Fi almost didn t work And the place wasn t super clean The water pressure in shower was non sufficient to take a normal shower , The location was really good
254666,Hotel 82 London, Tiny bedroom Tiny elevator Very noisy fridge and air con Barely slept a wink Breakfast was awful and very poorly stocked Very little selection Very poor quality food Ham was like spam mushrooms and tomatoes came from a tin Had to ask for the teapot to be left at the table for top ups Space in the breakfast room was extremely limited , Good Central Location Nice friendly receptionist 
254667,Hotel 82 London, The girl at the reception was very unkind at arrival Wanted us to pay for the whole stay 3 nights in advance Very odd as you normally pay when you check out and not when checking in Standard answer to everything hotel policy We agreed to pay the first night in advance but she insisted on paying the following 2 nights before 11 next morning and she left a message on my voicemail to remind and come to the desk immediatley Furthermore the curtains in the room didn t block the light at all and the airco didn t work Found some trash on the floor from the previous guests No cups in the cupholder in the bathroom The room in itself was small but nice but that didn t make up for all the other things , The location is good Close to Bakerstreet and Regent s Park 
254668,Hotel 82 London, Everything else I was booked in room G03 and the air conditioner was not working upon checkin Upon request one of the front desk staff came in and tried to fix it and assured me it would be fixed in 20 minutes 40 minutes later the AC was still not working and I was about to fall sick Upon further request the front desk staff tried calling maintenance who took their own sweet time The entire checkin saga continued for close to 2 hours during which time I was waiting in their lpungent Finally the AC did start working and from there on the experience was ordinary All in all it would have been an OK experience if the start would have been good , Location
254669,Hotel 82 London,No Negative, Very nice clean well appointed hotel provides all amenities in the room one can ask for very helpful hotel staff and not to add excellent location
254670,Hotel 82 London, Breakfast could have been better but was a bonus as we hadn t realised it was included , Staff were great especially reception Went above and beyond when asked for help Five minute walk from Oxford street Great for Hyde park 
254671,Hotel 82 London, The bathroom was dark and there was no hand soap only shampoo Housekeeping came in late and did not bring new towels or even a bag for the dustbin The shower looked amazing at first but there was hardly any water and none of the extra features worked Also the room temperature was either freezing cold or too hot changing it was like entering a lottery Last the breakfast was a joke Fried eggs tasting like rubber cold sausages and beans and the toast might have been in the same room as the toaster but not in it The coffee was good though , The location is excellent Easy access to both underground Baker Street and shopping Oxford Street and also Regent s Park is just a stonethrow away The hotel seems quite recently refurbished and it s tastefully decorated I also enjoyed the usb charger in my room as well as the free wifi and excellent choice of TV channels The small fridge was a pleasant surprise and in my opinion such a thing should be mandatory in every hotel 
254672,Hotel 82 London, 3 pepper pots empty breakfast no napkins available No soap in room but plenty of shampoo conditioner, Lovely staff and spacious clean room Great location 
254673,Hotel 82 London, The shower is very old don t expect a comfortable shower Our room was facing the street very noisy in the morning The kids room on the other side was calmer , The staff were very helpful and always nice Location is 7 min walk from Baker street subway station Very fast reliable free internet in the rooms Good breakfast 
254674,Hotel 82 London, Breakfast is served 7 30 10 00 unfortunately if you are not in the breakfast room before 8 00 all the pre cooked food is cold I would advise cooking to order it is only a small establishment eggs that have been fried and left for nearly two hours are not appealing Also the booking confirmation boasted air conditioning this was not available in our room, The location is this hotel s biggest selling point
254675,Hotel 82 London, it was very dirty I could see the footsteps and a lot of dirt from the previous guest still on the carpet toilette was not cleaned no real windows just fake windows with a wall behind no adapters for power available no space in the luggage room available so I was forced to leave my luggage on the corridor where everybody has access to so I took it with me shower was just a little bit of dripping water, Location is good if you have planned to go shopping around Soho and Oxfort street
254676,Hotel 82 London, Breakfast was adequate in terms of quantity but eggs were cold Sliced pan bread was bit of a let down , Single room was compact but comfortable There was little iPad in room with WiFi that was very helpful WiFi in hotel was also good Nice small reception area with free nepresso coffee Tea making facilities in room and fridge was bonus Staff were very helpful Room was clean and shower was good Central Area Baker street is best tube and there is good bus route 
254677,Hotel 82 London, Window opened onto an internal fire escape so no view at all however in some ways during the light summer months it does mean you don t get woken up by the light , Location and general upkeep was good The room was small but I went for a single so no problem but was neat and tidy and nicely laid out 
254678,Hotel 82 London,No Negative, The place is perfect for anyone looking for a clean comfortable place to sleep while travelling Very close to Baker street tube station and oxfort street The breakfast is very nice and sufficient and all facilitis as well maintained Super comfortable beds The best part is the great and friendly staff thank you gorgeous Damian and awsome Tina 
254679,Hotel 82 London, At arrival we were taken to a room with a 1 2m large bed It was really a too small for a couple We asked the staff and they searched to bring us to another room but it was frightening , Very nice staff great location and really good breakfast 
254680,Hotel 82 London, rooms are ok faint smell of cigarettes either from another room or historically It s odd that guests have to sign a specific damages form when you check in breakfast was poor looked like very cheap produce used and unappealing in presentation i didn t eat a thing i can normally find something to eat all in all not good value worth paying a tad more for a proper 4 star , location is good 
254681,Hotel 82 London, Warning Upon checkin asked for passport photo id and two credit Cards After a 20 minute battle i was finally allowed to check in No AirCON the room is hot and can t open window onto main road Tiny tiny lift, Good sized bed and room
254682,Hotel 82 London, The first room was not clean The room was claustrophobic and very basic without even a desk chair or somewhere to put luggage Half used toiletries in the bathroom Noisy air conditioning Poor shower Poor breakfast Not a pleasant stay , The staff were friendly and helpful and gave me another room when I informed them that the initial room was not clean 
254683,Hotel 82 London, The only thing with the room was it was very noisy so didn t get a lot of sleep with doors being banged and I don t know if we were by the kitchen area, The room was lovely and clean very nice for being a basement room
254684,Hotel 82 London, Although the bathroom sink tap had good pressure the shower didn t It was probably okay when new but the fancy fittings no longer work We suggest a plain one with better pressure and a soap dish or shelf in the cubicle as well Also the wooden skirting around the walls in the main room was missing in some places and was a bit of a hazard Otherwise the room was nice , Staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast delicious Great location Storage in the room was very good and the bed was comfortable We will happily stay there again 
254685,Hotel 82 London, Couldn t contact hotel prior to check in Check in poor despite being 8 months pregnant there was no offer to carry my bags etc Wifi didn t work and temperature of the room couldn t be controlled Noisy over night , central location
254686,Hotel 82 London, No hot water as the boiler was broken Disgusting breakfast with very poor hygiene cups and cutlery had not been washed properly Manager was supposed to contact me and didn t Don t stay here , Nothing Disgraceful hotel 
254687,Hotel 82 London, The room wasn t particularly clean you could feel the dirt under your feet if you walked about bare foot The room itself had a number of features that not only didn t work but didn t seem capable of working such as the bed side lights that had for some strange reason a USB plug on them but there weren t any USB sockets near the bed The staff weren t great either we were kept waiting for several minutes at reception before we checked in to find that the receptionist had been outside the hotel with a young lady , The hotel is fairly handy for Marylebone train station it is about a 10 min walk 
254688,Hotel 82 London, Nothing, Near to Baker street station and within walking distance to Oxford Street Size of triple room and toilet roomy given that most rooms in London are rather small Nice breakfast as well 
254689,Hotel 82 London, Hairdryer Milk that was in date A warm breakfast with a good selection of cooked food , A clean quiet room with a comfortable bed Good location Staff friendly and helpful 
254690,Hotel 82 London, breakfast was cold and upon arrival at 10pm to check in the door was locked and ended up having to wait 30 mins for reception supposed to be 24 hours to arrive apparently he was in the toilet , room was good size and good location
254691,Hotel 82 London, The door of the shower room dose not shut really well Despite that I am fully aware of there might be no natural light in the room but it still makes me uncomfortable , The breakfast is really convenient for traveling The stuff there are very nice and helpful The location is great and safe for solo traveler 
254692,Hotel 82 London, Breakfast was very disappointing For the price you would expect higher quality not reheated Vienna sausages cheap polony and fake orange juice And when we arrived an hour before breakfast finished the hot options were almost finished and not replenished, Rooms are small but more than adequate if you re not planning on spending much time at the hotel Room was clean and bed comfy The shower was great Staff were very friendly and helpful 
254693,Hotel 82 London, Limited breakfast selection Hot breakfast stone cold and the toast was still white Hairdryer fell to pieces and grimy shower Shower gel looked like they had already been used half full , Well placed for the purpose of my visit
254694,Hotel 82 London, Staff inability to adjust problems Broken heat system Lack of bread cheese salami salad Cleaning poor Change of towels And some more things, Locatine Staff kindnesd
254695,Hotel 82 London, It seems that there are not enough towels in the hotel because we get strange towel sets floor towels instead of hand towels only one bath towel for two persons etc Once a staff forgot to empty a bin once to add new tea bags and milk The room was not ever cleaned during our 5 days stay Shower panel in the bath has only upper shower and no other options that was not very convenient Bathtub had no facility to take a bath Shower screen was too small so we always had a water on the floor after The biggest problem is the street noise Windows were too thin to keep all day round street traffic noise outside and an area around has several hospitals so ambulances sound also didn t give us a good sleep , The hotel is very conveniently situated around 6 7 min by foot from Baker Street undeground station and several bus stops on the same Baker Street The area around Baker Street has everything one might need numerous cafe from healthy organic fast food and arabian shawarma to European menu cafe with eggs Benedict etc restaurants post office dry cleaning services photo service tea shop etc A Staff in the hotel is polite and helpful They keep the baggage on the day of your departure if needed Very small elevator for only 2 slim persons with 2 small suitcases but it was not a problem we never waited Hotel has 4 floors and we lived on the 4th A room was bigger than average in London and a little bit tired High ceiling high windows clean towels each day 1 bath towel 1 hand towel per person and 1 floor towel a kettle with 2 cups and tea coffee set for two sugar milk tea bags and instant coffee refrigerator 2 small bottles of water on the day of arrival a piece of soap and 2 3 small bottles of shampoo with conditioner hairdryer iron and small ironing board in the wardrobe Bathtub with shower panel Airconditioner Soft beds Hard thick pillows I had to sleep without pillow at all A handy mobile tel with internet for 2 pounds per day is available if you need it There is a Nespresso coffee machine in the lobby but we didn t try it We never tried a breakfast so no comments about it also In general it is a convenient hotel to stay for several days if you are not too sensitive for traffic noise 
254696,Hotel 82 London,No Negative, Great location I asked for double bed but ultimately had two twins pushed together Quite uncomfortable if you role over into middle Otherwise reasonable short stay hotel
254697,Hotel 82 London, We had a triple room in the basement size wise was ok but limited light Bathroom is rather small and toiletries old and worn When got to the room it was not properly clean with dust on the floor asked the reception to handle it and when returned a couple hours later was still not properly done Better but not properly done The next day the room was not serviced at all We left the hotel in the morning came back after diner and it was as we left it in the morning with some extras as someone was checking the air conditioning and left the battery package on the floor Breakfast room rather small and selection limited , Location was good 10 minutes walk from Oxford street marble arch 10 minutes from Baker Street underground station Damien and Tina from the reception were helpful in providing required information 
254698,Hotel 82 London, Breakfast didn t start until 7 30 I needed to be at my meeting venue for a 7 30 start , Great to have a fridge in the room very comfortable large bed a super equipped bathroom
254699,Hotel 82 London, The hot breakfast was very limited The shower in our room needed a good deep clean , The location in relation to Lords cricket ground is good Room size was also good 
254700,Hotel 82 London, Toilet very low seat cover needed attention Couldn t get internet in basement room, Staff were fabulous bed comfy breakfast good variety location awesome next door to Baker St 
254701,Hotel 82 London, There were several issues but the main problem was a non friendly staff member who had completely ruined our staying experience Already at the night of the check in we were requested to pay for the entire stay which was surprising as I had always been paying at the check out Eventually we agreed that I d pay for the first night paid cash and the rest on the day after He issued us our key cards and we went to our room The next evening I approached the front desk to pay for the rest of the stay where the same guy was on shift while my wife with our toddler went to the room since the kid desperately needed a bathroom I completed the transaction and headed to the room when the clerk indifferently said oh by the way your key is not valid anymore let me issue you a new one In the meanwhile my wife had stumbled upon a locked door and ran back downstairs to find some other toilet They actually locked us outside our room with our luggage inside without any prior warning while we weren t short on the rent Any attempt to complain were responded by the dry cliche Sorry this is our policy If that wasn t enough when I returned back home I found out that they actually charged my credit card for the entire stay without omitting the first night which was already paid in cash while the amount on the receipt was the correct one In addition 1 The room was heading to the main road which was noisy since it s on a bus route and there was a flickering light on the building next to it which prevented us from opening both the blinds and the windows during the night 2 During one of the nights around 3am the fire alarm went off extremely loudly for at least 15 minutes hell on earth with a confused and panicked toddler and staff without any answers 3 The maid lady was leaving the new towels toilet papers and soaps on out bed instead of the bathroom Any requests to the front desk about it didn t assist 4 , The location is fine 7min walk for a tube station and a 100meter from a bus station The room size was acceptable 
254702,Hotel 82 London, We paid a lot of money for the room and our toilet was small and they repaired the previously broken toilet seat by gluing it back together I would expect a good toilet seat based on the price we paid for the room, The hotel was in a good location and very easy to get to locations in London
254703,Hotel 82 London, The sink was clogged The moment you open the tap the sink drain was logged and one had to wait to allow the water to drain to use the sink most inconvenient The hand held shower was broken unusable The bed mattress was not comfortable at all Looking at the price I paid for this 1 night stay I was overcharged definitely and would not recommend this hotel looking to use the toilet facilities Also though the staff us aware of these issues they continue to place people in such rooms without fixing the facilities , Good breakfast convenient location
254704,Hotel 82 London, It was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in London Hotel 82 would be the worst option in terms of price vs value There are many more hotels in London within similar price range with this hotel and it is better to not to be deceived from its pictures and reviews We have stayed for 5 nights and our room floor was not wiped even once Also floors and all carpets in rooms as well as other places in hotel were always dirty Our toilet was not cleaned well before we checked in Door and sink were dirty and dusty Furthermore the faucet was broken There were some negative comments about the hotel s breakfast but we did not care much about it we believed that we could find something for us in any case But the hotel has really limited number things to eat for breakfast not about variety but literally limited number like only 2 slices of cheese or 2 eggs for whole guests In addition to these there was no bread at all during 3 mornings Unfriendly and unhelpful staff especially the reception staff Some reviews mentioned that the hotel has a coffee machine in lobby it is really hard to call that room as lobby by the way but during our 5 nights 6 days stay we have not found any available glass to use that machine to drink a coffee and we need to find and ask to the staff to bring us a glass each time which is not so fun One of our room s window cannot be opened and we have to stayed airless room for 5 nights even though we stayed rooms from upper floors , Location
254705,Hotel 82 London,No Negative, Nice welcome got what we asked for twin beds and breakfast was included Nice touch of tea coffee biscuits in the room also help yourself stuff in the loungh 
254706,Hotel 82 London, I don t usually moan about hotels because I can t be bothered with the hassle but The Bed had hairs in it before we d even got in the bed side cabinets were extremely dusty no cold water out tap in bathroom shower leaked too curtain holders were falling off the wall and cigarettes on the small balcony outside doors,No Positive
254707,Hotel 82 London, Tea stains in the cup dash on the table prints on the wall The room is not well cleaned at all The room looks like it has been through very good time nice floor but fading in time as well , The location is quite OK Close to train station metro station The bus stop is not far where you can find bus to Oxford street and Piccadilly circus Very good breakfast and nice staff 
254708,Hotel 82 London, Didn t know about included b fast or free cell phone which should be advertised They were great advantages which we didn t expect and very much appreciated , Loved the loan of free cell phone for our use The room was very clean with daily maid service Good mattress Two twin beds together to make a king Tea in room Luggage storage on final day after check out Pleasant staff Delicious breakfast buffet with attentive server for coffee etc Highly recommend 
254709,Hotel 82 London, Several of the fittings in our bathroom were either broken or about to fail Examples the shower setting knob was seized the towel shelf was at a jaunty angle and the hair dryer hook was about to become detached There was also an unpleasant smell of stale water in our bedroom and en suite , The reception and kitchen staff were very pleasant welcoming and helpful 
254710,Hotel 82 London, Small rooms but you are in central London Poor quality in room coffee 2 biscuits left out on first day not replenished No toast offered for breakfast but nice that they provided breakfast as we didn t think we would have any No bar restaurant in hotel, quietish location without being too far from transport shops etc Pleasant staff who remedied small problems with the room Clean tidy rooms and common areas small nice lounge with coffee and fire 
254711,Hotel 82 London, Only 2 each of coffee and tea and glasses even though there were three of us Hairdryer appeared to be missing staff may want to check Breakfast was not too good at all, Beds were comfortable liked the little kitchenette in the room Staff were friendly Location was great
254712,Hotel 82 London, The room was in need of a bit of care tried to open the draw and the door fell off The shower wasn t that powerful and 2 of the jets didn t work I put in a request for a twin room which was ignored , Great location and comfy bed 
254713,Hotel 82 London, Room size could have been little bit larger and the beds could be more confortable, Location is very convenient 5 min walk to Baker station and Regent s park I advise you to have a walk on the park in the mornings Very very friendly staff The room size was fine Not very rich but very sufficient breakfast Expresso machine was available for free with some tea biscuits 24 hrs in the waiting room It is highly recommended to everyone
254714,Hotel 82 London, bath room area wasn t very clean shower facilities didn t work properly, Room is small but cozy coffe machine in the lobby is useful location is excellent
254715,Hotel 82 London, We travelled with an infant and were not even offered to be escorted to our room or help with our luggage which was in the basement The shower had moulds around the corners And over all cleanliness of the bathroom could have been better They can skip including breakfast or mention they provide cereals As those were the only things available And there were 6 8 people still coming to have breakfast and everything was already empty at 9 15 the kitchen staff are never seen I the breakfast room as well , Location was the main reason for choosing the hotel and that was good And the receptionist was friendly and tried to be helpful 
254716,Hotel 82 London, Room in basement Room in need of a refreshment e g old equipment not working Breakfast food below average and breakfast room where you really don t want to spend time , Location 
254717,Hotel 82 London, Wifi wasn t good Rooms were not taking care of in the morning Staff not really professional that s a shame , The location was excellent bed comfortable

254719,Hotel 82 London, No safty box in the rooms, Charming sweet hotel Great location in front of a bus station 8 min walk from Oxford st very kind and helpful staff great breakfast lovely rooms 
254720,Hotel 82 London, Nothing unless you have ludicrous exoectations for the price, Location location location Friendly reception Lucky with very large room with very large cabinet supplying tea coffee etc plus micro wave Unused but would be useful for family Could have good future if they maintain standard I experienced on fkeeting visit Left early so no breakfast report Not up to the Landmark but that was not expected 
254721,Hotel 82 London, Room not cleaned at all Stayed two nights No facilities in hotel No restaurant or bar etc Breakfast room in basement but we didn t bother Rusty shower surround , Comfortable room although very compact Bathroom well equipped and good size Check in staff good and moved us to rear facing room away from noisy road 
254722,Hotel 82 London, arriving to find my room was set to 32 degrees centrigade the staff member tried to get the air con to work but it failed he kindly moved me to another room, the staff member who dealt with the fire alarm at 3am was very good indeed 
254723,Hotel 82 London, Shower wasn t powerful at all There was a lot of noise from traffic outside but we understand this is inevitable in central london, Nice comfy room breakfast was similar to in small b and bs in Europe we enjoyed it Staff were friendly
254724,Hotel 82 London, The rooms were extremely small I would choose another hotel just for this issue I totally understand that room area is money but for this kind of money I get to expect more , Breakfast was really convenient especially when you are in London 
254725,Hotel 82 London, The bathroom was not on a 4 star hotel level mould in the shower and it would have needed a bit more of cleaning The smell of the breakfast bacon sausages perfumed the common areas I would say it is more of a 3 star hotel , The location is great several bus and underground lines just around the corner We had a very quite and comfortable room and slept pretty good The price was good for being in central london 
254726,Hotel 82 London, I was on the ground floor and the windows wouldn t open and room was hot The a c wasn t working despite getting someone in to look at it The light from outside kept me ALL awake at night I am use to staying in London hotels with bad curtains and light coming in but this was quite bad The shower door was broken and hanging off its hinges The bathroom wasn t cleaned to a very good standard Breakfast food was very low quality it was quite disgusting nasty cheap bread I walked out and had breakfast else where , The room was quiet Iron in room 
254727,Hotel 82 London, Some grumpy staff Very small rooms No sound insulation so road facing rooms can hear all the traffic outside all night Poor quality decor especially in bathroom TV not visible from desk , Some friendly staff Free breakfast 
254728,Hotel 82 London, Average Hotel no real highlights no real issues good value if travelling for leisure not for business Lift not for claustraphobes , Location good for Oxford Street
254729,Hotel 82 London, the breakfast was fine for what I needed but just some fruit croissants pastries would be good I m not concerned about the hot food but the selection was limited if I had been , nice quiet room didn t feel like a London hotel biscuits and water felt welcome and safe
254730,Hotel 82 London,No Negative, Very nice room not very big but cosy and clean Good location near Baker Street Tube stop and a short walk from regents park Neutral Breakfast was good but the room was small and cold during some times it was full and people had to wait shortly to get a seat

254743,Hotel 82 London, Breakfast was poor It said served from 7 30 but some things weren t ready on time pancakes were brought out at 8 too late for us as we d finished , Good value for money for the location I would recommend trying to book direct with the hotel as I found that would have been cheaper than on booking com 
254744,Hotel 82 London, Wifi was a little erratic , Comfortable room Very friendly and efficient staff Convenient location near to tube station shops and restaurants Breakfast included Good value for money for this area of London Our room at the rear was very quiet 
254745,Hotel 82 London, Rated as a 4 star hotel on booking com other sites say it was 3 star 3 star at best Although the room was clean there was a lot of limescale on shower the small details make a big difference , Location was great Decent value for money 
254746,Hotel 82 London,No Negative, There were 4 spotlights out in the room a crack in the glass on the toothbrush holder and the toilet seat has split but attempted to be fixed The lampshade was broken on arrival I reported this and it was swiftly removed All staff were lovely and couldnt of been more helpful was very clean throughout the whole hotel Unfortunately our triple room was next the the hotel boiler room so that did keep me awake at night The duvet was incredibly thin something thicker would of been better but am bedding and towels were extremely clean 
254747,Hotel 82 London, Room was small, The location is really good Easy access by underground Staff is extremely friendly and helpful I was offered a nice espresso coffee in the lobby was allowed to leave my heavy suitcases safely after checking out I also left a bag with expensive items in the room and it was returned to me Very good value for money also 
254748,Hotel 82 London, I stayed in one of the single rooms and the problem for me was that they are dark and airless because they face a closed in internal area and the first room had window that couldn t open which made matters worse The hotel should state this clearly in the rooms description In the first room I stayed the TV was so high up on the wall above the wardrobe that I couldn t watch it without getting a sore neck The single bed was quite small and a bit sagging which was ok for me but it could be quite uncomfortable for a big person , The location is excellent 5 min walk from Baker st tube 15 min walk to Paddington and Oxford st is only about 10 min away The hotel has been recently renovated by the look of it and it s clean and cheerful Breakfast is included and it s quite varied and plentiful served in a lovely room in the basement The staff were all nice and helpful quite unusual for London The hotel was great value for money for me but perhaps that was because the single rooms are not the best and therefore they are cheaper 
254749,Hotel 82 London, View , Two pleasant and helpful receptionists comfy and clean room All the staff were friendly kept the place spotless and breakfast included A good healthy start to the day 
254750,Hotel 82 London, Short bed Curtains didn t really darken the room Nice big bathroom but crappy shower so ask for a room with a well functioning one on booking , Nice area Spacious room clean
254751,Hotel 82 London, Everything Need better staff and a change of policy Do not accept a basement room as they stink Photos misleading , Nothing Rubbish odours in room and basement Rude staff refused room change and then refund Left after 20 mins Disgusting Not four star 
254752,Hotel 82 London,No Negative, I am very happy that I got to stay in this hotel Very reasonably priced It is conveniently located walking distance from Paddington Station which is only 15min from Heathrow by express train but also from Oxford Street area Baker Street is round the corner The area surrounding the hotel is quiet but everything is there shops restaurants sights Staff is really friendly and helpful My room was clean the whole hotel was and OK equiped coffee tea iron Shower OK Bed was great Breakfast also OK Wifi very good 
254753,Hotel 82 London, this is nothing more than a B B cheply refurbished and cheaply furnished Got very little sleep due to room being very noisy due to traffic also room was constantly light due to street lights and poor curtains, near the office
254754,Hotel 82 London, some mornings there was no hot water for a shower We were on the ground floor and we could hear people coming and going using the stairs , Comfortable beds 10min walk to tube or bus 
254755,Hotel 82 London, Would have liked some moisturuser in the bathroom Bread served to cut not just toast when asked for croissants heated , The good cofee maker in the lounge Very helpful staff Offer to store luggage the morning we left Excellent bus routes from Glouster Place and Baker Street rendering tube unecessary 
254756,Hotel 82 London, Hotel has been very unfair my credit card has been charged twice They said that the first transaction was only a pre authorization but finally I paid two times Hotel never replied to my request for refund Finally Booking com refunded me as hotel never replied to them as well , Good position cleanliness and comfortable room 
254757,Hotel 82 London, the breakfast selection was very good but the buffet of hot food on the saturday morning was cold during the week it was served individually so was nice and hot There was a spa shower in the room but only the shower head worked We weren t bothered as we only expected a shower head , Excellently located hotel extremely reasonable price for an ensuite room walking distance to the tube and Regent s park Lots of restaurants around the area staff very helpful Hint if you want a quiet room ask for one at the back of the hotel The beds are bigger than double size two single divans made into a larger bed 
254758,Hotel 82 London, The bathroom was rather oddly appointed with a really tiny toilet awkward to use and shower There were a couple of minor maintenance issues in the bathroom the toilet seat was cracked and the shower head would not stay up so had to be held There were no usable sockets for the kettle in the kitchenette area , The staff were delightful and couldn t have been more helpful The room was well appointed and nicely decorated and the hotel was well located The stay offered good value for money considering the central London location and the good size and amenities including an unexpected kitchenette of the room 
254759,Hotel 82 London, The bread and croissants were basic and dry , Nice very large comfy bed nice large shower bathroom Ideal location for the railway station we were using 
254760,Hotel 82 London, The smell from the kitchen downstairs every morning that goes into our room on 3rd floor And the smell of the pipe or drain I don t know from the bathroom , Htl 82 fullfilled my expectation for my short trip to London with my daughter Good room rate clean good location That the breakfast was included surprised me in a good way of course The staff at the front office Damian I guess as seen on the receipt was very friendly and helpful he did not only do his job but he showed his attention too It was nice We had first the room on 1st floor facing Gloucester Place Road not noisy but u could hear the busy street unfortunately the outside window was broken and only the inside window closed it was too cold and he moved us to the 3rd floor on the following day 
254761,Hotel 82 London, The day before arrival I rang to check if breakfast was included the man on the phone told me my booking had been cancelled as I had not given my card details and they were now fully booked I had given my card details twice via Booking com I never received any communication from them about cancelling my booking I was rather annoyed at this as I was travelling a long way to London for a meeting He did later find that my booking had been reinstated so we did have a room On arrival there was a sign on the reception desk saying they would be back in 5 mins We waited almost 15 mins then my partner wandered through the lounge dining room looking for signs of life and knocked on a door back there The same man I has spoken to on the phone came out and he made some comment about us not being patient which we felt was quite rude So not overly impressed with this guy We would probably stay again due to it being nice hotel and good value for the location Shame the staff let it down it made us feel nervous about arriving and passing reception , Free wi fi 24 hour reception desk lounge with coffee machine breakfast came with the room rate although unfortunately we did not have time to have breakfast on this visit Room was pretty quiet hairdryer in bathroom large shower and comfy bed Good location about 10 mins walk from Marble Arch tube station various restaurants nearby 
254762,Hotel 82 London, took a while to figure out how heater worked noisy road need blackout curtains as light comes in, near Marylebone station and transport links friendly reception free wifi under my booking tv with many channels clean complimentary breakfast we didn t have it but sounded good all modern cons fridge iron
254763,Hotel 82 London, Basement room was a little warm but air conditioning unit was great, Great location near Baker Street tube Exceptionally clean Very pleasant reception staff
254764,Hotel 82 London, Phone number on the booking confirmation email was not for the correct hotel location it was for a sister hotel located elsewhere so when I called to inquire for the best Underground station to arrive there I was told erroneous information costing me time late at night and 15 Lbs in cab fare On the phone the rep had named the wrong station options and said the hotel was a 3 or 5 min walk When I exited the station Google said 38 min hence the cab When I arrived at Hotel 82 the desk clerk recognized the issue when I mentioned it and was sincerely apologetic saying they really need to get that changed No compensation or upgrade was mentioned though I could tell she was empathetic Other drawback was that two lights did not work the light over the bathroom sink and a ceiling light over one side of the double bed Not sure of the issue but on cable TV only one channel would come through with video My room was in the basement which wasn t a surprise after reading other reviews I wasn t intending to spend much time in the room though working lights and cable would have been a plus I mentioned their pros of helpful staff and good location though I ll prob scan other options next visit , Staff were very helpful Location very good and convenient to Underground stations Oxford St and Marble Arch Free wifi and breakfast though breakfast was nothing special 
254765,Hotel 82 London, Shower tended to spray water every where and a hand rail would be useful for getting in and out of the bath , The service was first class especially from Damian Thank You Also delighted to find that there was a free breakfast again the staff were very helpful and friendly 
254766,Hotel 82 London, A room on the side of the street may be a bit noisy for some people cars and buses are passing by , Friendly host thanks Damian breakfast included comfy bed in room tea making facilities We felt very welcome in this hotel And it is only a 5 min walk to the Baker Street underground station 
254767,Hotel 82 London, Traffic noise at night but I managed to sleep somehow The shower could be improved but worked fine , Good accommodation My room was clean and without carpets recommended for allergic people I am usually a very demanding guest but definitely the assistance provided by the gentleman at the reception Damian was very professional and helped solving any issue arisen he is seriously engaged in his work and can manage anything with control and competence 
254768,Hotel 82 London, Nothing of real note but other guests may need to know that the lift to the upper floors is very small two people with serious luggage may have to take it in turns , A very comfortable and nicely appointed room for the price I was charged An easy walk into Oxford Street and the West End for those that want it
254769,Hotel 82 London, I did not try the breakfast so I don t know how it is Small elevator but at least there is one , Nice room Quiet Clean Good location Really nice welcome and good advice by the receptionist Damian Tina was really nice too but I did not get the chance to see her often 
254770,Hotel 82 London, No telephone in room made 24 7 reception manning if required more difficult to access , Comfortable but quite small rooms perfect for a couple of days sightseeing in London 
254771,Hotel 82 London, The breakfast room was a little small if everyone came down at the same time to eat , The service was particularly good Damian on the front desk could not have been more helpful He was smart articulate and keen An asset to the hotel 
254772,Hotel 82 London,No Negative, Great surprise to have the breakfast included even if there was no meal plan specified The room was cozy clean fully refurbished bathroom and new furniture Good heating Great location 10 min walk to Hyde Park but in a nice quiet area Very nice staff 
254773,Hotel 82 London, The room was very small Breakfast was disappointing There were eggs and sausages on plates getting cold They were not kept in a warmer Staff offered to re heat the food but that didn t seem right We tried the scones and breads but they were very stale , The staff were all friendly and helpful The location was good and the bed comfy A shower with lots of spray and decent sized fluffy towels 
254774,Hotel 82 London, The breakfast The products could have been of better quality The breakfast room itself is a bit ugly and does not compare with the lounge that was cosy and had a nice atmosphere , The layout of the room the decoration the fact that it was warm cosy and especially clean
254775,Hotel 82 London, The lift was too mini , I stayed three nights in Hotel 82 with my father The hotel was recently refurnished so everything was quite new The room was clean and big The staff were friendly and helpful And the location is excellent 5 mins walk to Baker Street Station and we could walk directly to Oxford Circus The breakfast was okay 
254776,Hotel 82 London, I asked a room with bathroom but was shower instead maybe bathroom means shower for english people Internet access was very poor and no telephone The bed was too soft that I couldn t sleep well even though I was very tired Noisy building work nearby , Starff was kind 
254777,Hotel 82 London, We felt like a bit of an inconvenience at breakfast and it wasn t what I would call an English breakfast but it was nice that it was provided , Lovely room very comfy bed and great location Polite and helpful reception staff 
254778,Hotel 82 London, The taxi company the hotel recommends is useless Just flag down a normal black cab so much more reliable and probably half the price even if the recommended company says cheap , Hotel was in a great location walk away from Baker Street tube station Free wifi and offered us a free breakfast as part of their refurbishment incentive Staff were friendly and rooms were OK sized Perfect for our 1 night stay would definitely recommend 
254779,Hotel 82 London, Nothing really All perfectly acceptable, The rooms were small but very clean and well appointed I have no complaints at all given the cost of the room It was excellent value for money
254780,Hotel 82 London, parking was a issue and we were told to arrive then book parking this was a very expensive way of doing it tea making facilities in the room didnt include a spoon and wasnt refilled daily and the shower looked impressive but was just a show piece , nice clean hotel situated central to everything we wanted to see
254781,Hotel 82 London, The room was noisy all night due to the secondary glazing being missing which mean that the equipment noise from outside the room was too loud , Value for money 
254782,Hotel 82 London, No heating I arrived for an overnight stay at 10pm on a icey January evening and was directed to a room on the basement level The room was pleasant but had a chilly temperature This became more apparent on getting out of my warm clothes and into bed Not being able to get warm under the duvet I eventually found window partially open but couldn t close it fully due to a TV aerial lead sitting in the opening I adjusted the wall mounted thermostat to increase the temperature from the stated 16C to 20C There was no effect after an hour and by this time I was in bed close to shivering I then switched on the air conditioning unit above the door and set it too a temperature above 20C Again there was no improvement and despite the noise generated from the unit the air emitted remained cold after 20 to 30 minutes Unable to sleep due to the room temperature at 1am I found a wall mounted electric heater position behind a desk This thankfully did work but didn t get the room up to a pleasant level I had an uncomfortable sleep thereafter Unfortunately this had a significant negative impact on my stay ,No Positive
254783,Hotel 82 London, The breakfast was offered but do not pay for it because you can get better in Baker s street coffee shops for The same price The girl in the r ception has nothing to do in the hotel not nice at all and do not help she has to find another job I think Not even a smile , The service was quite good as a whole Special thanks to Damion who was really Nice and helpful he helped me with my luggage and to get me a cab and even offered a coffee very kind of him The h tel was clean comfortable bed and no so far from Baker s street station and Madame trussaud museum so very nice to visit London The room was really nice room 404 4th floor a bit noisy but it s ok for London Clean and perfect service room I will come back again and I really recommend this hotel 
254784,Hotel 82 London, I didn t find the bed very comfortable The hallway had wooden floor which meant I was woken up repeatedly when other guests walked down the hallway The curtains were too short to black out the light from the windows , I thought the location was quite good I liked the modern feel look and the staff were very polite 
254785,Hotel 82 London, My room had an internal window opening onto a permanently lit stairwell with inadequate curtains No ventilation No table nor chair , Location very good Facilities in room include hairdryer fridge and iron Recently done up and very clean Staff very pleasant and helpful 
254786,Hotel 82 London, On arrival heating was not working Tina made it work The bathroom floor was covered with black long hair clearly not mine The shower pipe was off the hook The room got cleaned only once every three days and the chambermaids did not clean the bathroom every day When I asked why the receptionist said this is what it was decided by the management , Tina went far beyond her duty trying to solve the many problems my room had Location is good and bedrooms are small but not unconfortable If only the management invested more in cleaning it would be great 
254787,Hotel 82 London,No Negative, Ideal for me as I no longer live in London and had an event at the Grovesenor as I was unable to expense it I wanted somewhere local to work not too expensive and comfortable This place is perfect 
254788,Hotel 82 London, We asked for a taxi through the reception an it looks like it was a friend of No counter no bill , Guy at reception was extremely helpful Nespresso cafe in lounge was great too 
254789,Hotel 82 London, The breakfast service could be improved we were not greeted on arrival although staff member around and muddled our way along The full English also has room for improvement but over all this is a fabulous London base and great location , Great location very clean and tidy Just what we were looking for and would happily return

254792,Hotel 82 London,No Negative, This is a boutique welcoming hotel great for a business stay or I could see myself staying here overnight on a social visit to London You can walk to Marylebone within 10 mins and back towards Oxford street in around 15 mins It has the essential facilities and a good breakfast The room was clean and the staff very friendly Would stay here again 
254793,Hotel 82 London, The walls are quite thin so although the guests themselves weren t unnecessarily loud or disruptive their actions such as using bathroom was very loud Also the sound of doors opening and closing everywhere is easily heard from the basement room We only stayed two nights and needed to be up early so this didn t bother us but i d imagine this would be disruptive for travelers planning to stay longer and needing to lie in etc , Incredibly friendly staff Check in staff were great and the complimentary breakfast staff were friendly and attentive Complimentary breakfast included cooked sausages and eggs Location was excellent and room was great value for money We were in a basement double room complete with small kitchen area Window was away from main street so no external noise 
254794,Hotel 82 London, Double bed was two single beds combined so it was annoying to sleep in the night There was a telephone to reach the operator No other major troubles , It was a fine location easy check in and checkout They offered free breakfast and wifi which was amazing for the location Very close to baker station 
254795,Hotel 82 London, The lift is tiny but thats ok just one person and one bag at a time The dining hall was very hot, I booked this hotel because of the great value for an amazing location in marylebone and it didnt disappoint The place was small but clean and had everything we required for a three night stay sightseeing in london the staff were incredibly welcoming and we got complimentary breakfast and stored our bags for free on the last day which was perfect 5 minute walk to baker street tube station Would recommend this hotel Thanks again to the staff
254796,Hotel 82 London, The toilet in our room had a cracked toilet seat which just screamed germs The toilet was also very small as was the room for three people and three large suitcases Plus we were in the basement which made it quiet but very hot My sister however had a lovely room so I think it depends which room you get , Location and value for money was very good plus a breakfast included was nice I appreciated that they had our room ready for an early check in

254803,Hotel 82 London, There were some little things that felt unfinished And in terms of cleanliness all in all V good but in the bathroom some bits by the shower and the tops of the tiles were very dusty Other than that spotless , I like the layout of the room and it looked like it had been recently updated The room was very quiet and the bed extremley comfortable 
254804,Hotel 82 London, Dismayed with the shower which looked promising with many functions apparent Reality was that the shower only worked in normal overhead spray and because of the loose fittings the water flow was poor , The location was perfect for our evening in London Comfortable bed and the bottled water and biscuits provided in the room were a nice touch We were too tired to appear for breakfast 
254805,Hotel 82 London, There was no kettle so I had to Get hot water from the kitchen not a problem for them but not always easy with a screaming 1 year old and no plug for the bath unfortunately , We had a little baby and the staff were fantastic They put a travel cot up for us and helps with hot water for bottles morning and night As it was newly refurbished we got free breakfast too 
254806,Hotel 82 London, Shower was weak as mentioned in reviews The bed was supposed to be a King Size it was a small double so I am glad I was alone after all It was off set by the nice furnishings and convenience of the location , Staff were helpful and friendly
254807,Hotel 82 London, Although recently renovated there are still some bits that could be improved The hairdryer in the bathroom had a clogged grill and would shut off after 30 seconds or so the shower could have used a little more water pressure and the capsules for the Nespresso machine in the lobby which was a lovely find were few and scarce and there were none left on Monday morning , Spent three days in mid November a short holiday trip The hotel has been completely renovated just a couple of months ago The staff was really nice and the continental breakfast really good The location was wonderful just a 5 or so minutes walk from Baker Street underground station perfect to go everywhere one would like Although on a quite big street the room facing on the back on the third floor was absolutely noiseless
