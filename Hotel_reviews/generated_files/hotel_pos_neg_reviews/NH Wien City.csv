377465,NH Wien City, limited lighting in room not exact information about availability of parking In general the booking com site is not offering clear info regarding parkings, location breakfast close to shops and metro possibility for parking at hotel parking places
377466,NH Wien City, Breakfast is low than average variety of food is acceptable but quality and freshness of food is very low it does not worth the price WiFi speed is very low, Location close to the shopping street entrance to the hotel is inside the block quite entrance to the metro is located in the same block app 20 meters from the hotel entrance 20 min walking distance to the center of Vienna Good design of the room small kitchen fridge working table spacious room windows look inside the block very quite Staff at reception is helpful
377467,NH Wien City, This hotlel is consider 4 stars while it shoulde be 3 stars and the staff are not helper and you have to serve your self and the price was very high for such this hotel , Only location and brekfast
377468,NH Wien City, It is not the hotel s fault Austrians are using a very unusual single person duvet Actually I found the dimensions quite awkward something like 1 00 x 1 80 m In the summer it is OK but I fear during cold season one would have trouble keeping warm especially if the person is XL plus , We liked that flat like living feeling of the unit rented a living room and a separate sleeping area plus a rather generous bathroom The location is meters away from a major shopping pedestrian only almost area and five minutes away from the Museums Quarter St Stephen s Cathedral is a very enjoyable approx 15 20 min walk 
377469,NH Wien City,No Negative, Our original room was fine but we found a problem with the bathroom and when we mentioned it to the reception staff they immediately sorted us out with an upgrade room which was wonderful All the staff were brilliant in particular Stefanie Pravida nothing was too much trouble and we got a lovely surprise when they sent us some fruit water as an apology We had a lovely experience at this hotel 
377470,NH Wien City, See above, The hotel was very central however the rooms were a bit of a dissapointment namely the sofas in them they were beyond expectation in that they were very worn and covered with a bed sheet I add that we booked three rooms and all had the same old old sofas Deffinately lers th e place down as the rooms were comfortable and spacious 
377471,NH Wien City, Nothing in particular Rooms are what they are modest yet comfortable and generally well appointed and priced accordingly , Good location An easy place to stay in that it is all of a certain standard and maintains that standard well comfortably modest and room rates are good value given that Will stay again as needed 
377472,NH Wien City,No Negative, Hotel is located on one of the main shopping streets in Vienna right beside the underground station giving you easy access to the whole city only 3 stops to st Stephens cathedral and main tourist attractions staff were friendly and made us feel very welcome room was very spacious and cleaned to a high standard 
377473,NH Wien City, We did not understand why the bathroom has no door maybe this is something new in the design of the hotels The bed was not very comfortable the mattres was too soft and the room wasn t very clean there was visible dust in many parts of the room , We very much enjoyed the location of the hotel close to the main attractions and also close to public transportation The room was extremely quiet as we requested and the view was very nice through the inner courtyard with green walls and sounds of blackbirds The minibar and the kettle were really useful We also appreciated that the room was cool even if outside the weather was extremely hot The staff was very nice and polite Breakfast is assorted with multiple possibilities for the vegetarians 
377474,NH Wien City, Somewhere in the description perhaps I must have missed the part where it would have been better for the taxi to come in from the street behind the actual address Lindengasse I believe That would have saved us a bit of a hike through the Peek and Cloppenburg entrance which also involves heaving our luggage up a few steps Even on Google Maps the location appears to be closer to Mariahilfer strasse It s not Also and this is one of those little hotel mysteries there was a cool little coffee machine into which you place coffee pucks or whatever you call them Why three That means one of us gets an extra tiny cup of coffee in the morning but not the other I requested another one the second day but really , Early check in was no problem as the room was ready Coming in from an overseas flight can sometimes be an issue Where do you go at 9 00 a m if you re exhausted and don t have a bed 
377475,NH Wien City, In the disadvantages were the lack of breakfast in our reservation and the lack of view but we knew both of them before our arrival The view was not required as we booked in the center of Vienna and we wanted access to metro station The breakfast would be appreciated especially in the price of 100 per night but taking into consideration the prices in the hotels across the city the value for money was decent , We booked the room for 4 nights The hotel was located in the center of Vienna The metro station was just below the hotel s entrance The personell was very polite The room was very clean and the towels were changed daily The bed was double large and very comfortable just like we have asked for it we ve asked for a double bed not two single beds attached I will definitely prefer it again in my next visit to Vienna 
377476,NH Wien City, Nothing bothered me This hotel is fantastic , I had a great time in Wien The room is very big Seriously It s really big Very comfortable The breakfast was charged as an extra and it was expensive 22 euros per day but valuable It has a lot of options and the quality of the products is very high The staff is great They were very welcoming The hotel is very near two subway stations and close to the Museum Quartier The building is near a shopping and has a very nice supermarket near the subway underground 
377477,NH Wien City, Standard room was dingy too much dark brown furniture and flooring and the red leatherette sofa bed was threadbare The view from the window was awful with barely a view of the sky Room was very stuffy with winter duvets The hotel entrance was not actually on the street indicated in the details The breakfast was outrageously expensive even for Vienna, It was very close to a u Bahn station although this was not made clear in the hotel details Bathroom was very clean
377478,NH Wien City, Breakfast was too expensive Hotel is really old and for the entrance you need to pass through an old passage Apperantely they havent renovate the hotel for a long time Furnitures were old too Location is definitely not good on a street noisy and bad street away from historical city center and metro station about 1 km away , Rooms were wide and clean
377479,NH Wien City, The A C was not for the whole of my 4 nights stay The response from the staff was horrible They provided me with an alternate table fan which was already in the room So the A C was not working from sometime and they don t bother to fix it Careful when taking Room 618 Also the bathroom has openings from the bedroom which is sliding door without lock and a standard door from the living area It might be uncomfortable for some people , Location With easy access to Metro and MuseumsQuartier All other places you need to walk a fair bit of distance or take a taxi The famous Glacis Beisl is also nearby 
377480,NH Wien City,No Negative, The hotel is conveniently located The area is surrounded by shops restaurants etc and it is close to the city centre The metro station is in the same building which is a plus 
377481,NH Wien City, Hotel is showing signs of wear Room furniture was worn and shabby bed amazingly comfortable however Probably still worth staying for the location , Location was excellent for city sightseeing Good range of restaurants nearby Just off main shopping street Superior room worth booking for the size of room Very pleasant staff 
377482,NH Wien City, The other older guy at front desk I forgot to take the newly bought 69 white wine out from the fridge wenn I checked out but when I come back after 3 hours he refused my request to check the room even I told him it s in the fridge he only looked in the cleaning department room and tell me no found meanwhile know the room is not taken yet I had to leave because I ran out of time for my next trip , The front desk staff is very friendly when I arrived 
377483,NH Wien City, Staff was rude one of the receptionists absent minded Sunday morning before 9am a cleaning lady knocked at the door and was actually supposed to go to another room Gym has a treadmill however all the machines are in the area of the sauna so it gets very very hot in the room making it close to impossible to use them properly or in a healthy manner , Location which is right in the middle of the main shopping street in Vienna 
377484,NH Wien City, rooms were totally overheated a lot of noise from the ventilation system furniture and interior design not adequate for this hotel category, location staff
377485,NH Wien City, Cleaning to be improved and rooms definetly need to be refurbished Parking is 19 Euro per night and breakfast 24 5 Euro per person Pay atention as nobody will communicate the tariffs upfront , Very good position very good bed 
377486,NH Wien City,No Negative, The hotel is very tidy easy to reach by metro in the centre of Vienna s shopping life which was especially important The breakfast was brilliant I especially liked the variety of viennoiserie jams smoothies cheese and the impeccable frothy melange An electric teapot was a great advantage One more important thing it was really quiet no noise heard either from neighbours or from outside 
377487,NH Wien City, i had better breakfast at NH DANUBE CITY, good central location in the building with a 4 level peek and cloppenburg store helpful staff private paid parking and also free street parking in weekends in the back street very nice clean and well maintained rooms good quality breakfast truly a 4 star hotel 
377488,NH Wien City, Staying at this Hotel was a very unpleasant experience I was on a business trip for one night and needed to work from the hotel Upon my arrival the first thing I was required to do was to block 150 euros on my credit card because we never know what the customers can do Once the check in was done I asked for the wifi password and only then I was told that the wifi was out of order at least for the whole day The only alternative which I was offered was to work from the Hotel s business center which turned out to be 2 old computers in a freezing cold corner of the Hotel s hall next to the entrance door In the room the curtains blind couldn t retract and one of the main lamps wouldn t work I notified the reception that the light bulb needed to be changed At first they told me that I must be mistaken Since I assured them the light bulb was broken they said they would send someone to fix it But nobody ever came , Breakfast is ok
377489,NH Wien City, Shower didn t seem to work the double bed was two beds put together , Location nice upgrade large room wifi friendly helpful staff value for money 
377490,NH Wien City, The hotel entrance is on Lindengasse street not on Mariahilfer street I suggest Booking com should change the hotel address as Lindengasse street Wifi not fast enough, A very nice hotel Helpful and friendly reception staffs Spacious and comfortable room Private parking garage Great location waking distance to every attractions Supermarket Lidl is only 100m away 
377491,NH Wien City, There was nothing, Staff was so helpful and room was very confortable It s place was very central too There were a lot places to visit in walking distance Adviced to all
377492,NH Wien City, terrible location on room 122 noises from other room kids who cry day and night terrible experience for me during my stay especially the New Year s Eve,No Positive
377493,NH Wien City,No Negative, The only good thing about this hotel is the location Otherwise is far from being a 4 hotel It was more like a 2 Rooms look very old and dirty the furniture is broken the bathroom had mold It was very annoying that the room was heated by an AC And that was broken We stayed with a baby inside the room for two nights we were freezing Even though we complained about it at the Reception they did not fix it They brought us a heater which wasn t working as well Would never choose this hotel again 
377494,NH Wien City,No Negative, Dear NH The hotel was good because it was at a perfect location to go to a wonderful art museum Even the room was cozy and the bed was well prepared SINCERELY YOURS OH family
377495,NH Wien City, 110 is right above the courtyard so the floor is very cold carpets would have been better in this room than parquet And there is no heating in the bathroom but if you leave the doors open it is warm enough apart from the tiled floor which is ice cold There were no proper mugs , The superior double is more like a suite we were very pleased with the separate bedroom the sliding doors made the layout of the room much more spacious than it would have been with normal doors The microwave the dishwasher and plates cutlery are a real plus Very comfortable bed and pillows We stayed in Vienna in a near record breaking cold and it was great not to have to go out to catch the underground An entrance is located in the same block as the hotel We got to the railway station without having to be exposed to the weather 
377496,NH Wien City, The access to the Hotel is not as easy as it could be If you go to the address that appears in Booking the only access is going through a commercial gallery and there are no obvious signs to guide you , The location
377497,NH Wien City, took us a couple of minutes to find the entrance to the hotel a stopper would have been nice a rug would have made the room cozier in my opinion, situated on mariahilfer strasse very close to the metro station practically right on top of it clean spacious rooms big led tv really nice breakfast
377498,NH Wien City, Receptionists are ignoring you never told us good day hello or hi exept on the arrival Staff in the breakfast buffet are nice , Great room especially if you travell with children 
377499,NH Wien City, The temporay parking space in front of the hotel for luggage load unload is very small No way to do it if there are 2 cars at the same time , The location very closed to metro and Mariahilfer street is the best point for this Hotel 
377500,NH Wien City, Breakfast is expensive There are supermarkets and restaurants near the hotel You can have breakfast outside Baby bed is not comfartable We asked for extra blanket to put under the baby , Everything is perfect Clean room Comfartable bed Seperate room to watch tv Clean bath tub In the centre of shopping street 
377501,NH Wien City, on the website it s written about a free late check uot on sundays but it is only under availability and it was not possible for us , We ve got a free update with a large souite 
377502,NH Wien City,No Negative, located in the heart of Vienna close to the mueseums and a u tube station staff was friendly and helpful we got a free upgrade amd a discount voucher room was very spacious and had everything we needed 
377503,NH Wien City, Wi fi could be better there was poor reception in the bedroom , Great location great value for money really very large room with a fridge that has a deep freeze 
377504,NH Wien City, We have never taken breakfast at the hotel We have found it very expensive , It was our fourth time in this hotel We keep returning to this place for a number of reasons 1 the rooms have a separate living room which is very convenient with children You can put them to sleep in their usual bedtime and enjoy something to eat or drink or just watch tv without disturbing them 2 location is perfect It is right on Mariahilferstrasse which means that shops bars and restaurants are all within walking distance 3 metro station is right outside of the hotel 
377505,NH Wien City, If I m being picky there were some things that could be improved The hotel is not easy to find needs better signage We came out of a different U station exit and couldn t find the hotel again Would have been nice to have milk powdered creamer with the tea coffee in the bedroom The only English speaking TV channels were News channels CNN BBC world Sky News The separate toilet should have had a small sink wash basin Room lighting could be improved , The apartment bedroom lounge diner bathroom was huge lots of space for 3 adults Location above the Underground station Fairly close to the Museum District Good choice of Breakfast foods 
377506,NH Wien City, Very old rooms not really comfortable Very old furnitures need urgent renovation Very expensive for a very old hotel very expensive breakfast Very strong cigarette smell , Very Good Location Food facilitys around hotel free wifi and nice front desk 
377507,NH Wien City, The entrance of the hotel is very hard to find There are a lot of stairs between the corridors and the room was very far away from the reception There is a short cut entrance but the staff did not inform me at the arrival The room was dark , The breakfast is very good Everything is fresh and the staff was very helpful during breakfast I am a tea lover and they provide service for both the cup and the pottery I also love the yoghurt they serve The location is very good You can either walk or take the tram to the touristic attractions 
377508,NH Wien City, I arrived there at night But the location of this hotel is not main road Finally I found the small sign where it is So I think it will be better if the sign is more bigger and notable , The staff is very kind They tried to help with their best 
377509,NH Wien City, Needs a bit of care and attention The lobby is a bit tired the rooms could do with a redecorate My hairdryer didn t work though they brought up a replacement straight away and loo roll holder broken , Spacious room quiet location but close to main shopping street comfortable bed and good breakfast Friendly staff
377510,NH Wien City, No room service, Location is great 2 stops from city center directly on the line for the CAT system to airport Close to museums quartier which is fun also in the night On the shopping Street Rooms are so big like a small home
377511,NH Wien City, The Day Staff on Friday didn t know where to get a Vienna travelcard This should be basic information available at the reception , Welcoming reception even though we arrived late at night The location is great but hard to find as the entrance is at the back of the building not as per the address Very spacious comfy rooms We were a big group of 6 adults and 2 kids and all enjoyed our stay here 
377512,NH Wien City, Although the room looked modern the electrics left a lot to be desired First of all two of the bulbs in the lights were not working On top of that the hairdryer blew up when my partner was drying her hair Although the staff did their best to help with the situation it left a little bit of a bad feeling about the stay, The location of the hotel was excelent A very pleasant surprise was that although the hotel was centrally located on a busy shopping street the room was ecxeptionally quiet
377513,NH Wien City, There were no available parking places at the hotel and we had to park in another parking much more expensive The two TVs do not work simultaneously The furniture would require refreshing , Good localisation on Mariahilfer strasse Large rooms Coffee and tea facilities Fridge in the room 
377514,NH Wien City, Nothing, Excellent location Friendly staff check in advice on places to get dinner Excellent breakfast Comfortable bed Large room Parking spot
377515,NH Wien City, There was confusion about breakfast is it or is it not included in price There is not enough parking for all guests Price for parking in nearby garage is 35 per day , Great breakfast and location Rooms are very clean Staff is also great 
377516,NH Wien City, Very bad house keeping service The secure is not that much no lock on the doors you can open it with card The towels are very old Many times they didnt put a new towel and the quplimentary tea and coffee The iron i have to ask them every time to bring to me Wifi was slow, Location was good Rooms size are big comparing with europe hotels Microwave
377517,NH Wien City, Breakfast pretty bad Not worth it I recommend you purchase only the stay and go have breakfast some where else Only the view from the cafeteria is just wonderful , Rooms very comfortable
377518,NH Wien City, Wifi is a basic thing in our days I don t see why NH have a weak free one and a payable strong one, Reception guys extremely helpful and professional
377519,NH Wien City, No room service after 4 pm The free wifi is very slow even when the signal is full, The location is not the best but it is good You get a nespresso machine in the room with 3 capsules daily
377520,NH Wien City, The quality of the internet access is awful In 2016 it is not acceptable to have so low speed Even if the access is for free it cannot be used I suggest that you charge EVERY room per night a few Euros more and spend this money to provide better speed for the access , The bed is very comfortable
377521,NH Wien City, They don t have a fitness room I like to work out and booked this room thinking my girlfriend and I will train but this was not a fitness center just a sauna and a bycicle in the middle of a really small room as well as a yoga ball Really disappointed for this Otherwise everything else was excellent Super nice hotel with really good location , Nice big room comfortable and clean Super location 
377522,NH Wien City,No Negative, I found very professional and kind the staff at the reception He provide me with useful information and he made sure I was aware of all the services the hotel offers 
377523,NH Wien City, Whenever the air condition kicked in it made a loud sound above the bathroom ceiling The free wifi was really bad in my room could not even receive emails or tweet , The hotel is located near Mariahilfer Str and it is a 5 minute walk away from the Museums Quartier Still my room was quiet The bed was very comfortable as well and the staff was very friendly and helpful 
377524,NH Wien City,No Negative, Excellent location Very helpful staff esp John and Sabrina The stay was very comfortable Would definitely recommend it to others and would want to come back here again 
377525,NH Wien City, The rooms do not look good the furniture is old and damaged the sofa was ratty with pieces falling off it there was dust on the floors the bathroom is outdated and with a dirty apearance The halls the elevator and the entrance to the section where we were accomodated are ugly and dirty The access to the hotel is made through a passage that is dirty and noisy the steps to the hotel were always full of snipes and garbage , The room has a good size and we were able to accomodate all our things given that we travelled with our 11 month old boy and the location ia good 
377526,NH Wien City, Nothing Breakfast was expensive so did not have it Perhaps a little guide in bathroom on how to work the shower information on how to contact reception , Excellent location friendly staff and lovely clean room 
377527,NH Wien City, Difficult to find in first instance Check out on something like google map Has Ubahn access almost in hotel building if you can find it , Super location on Mariahilfer Str close to Museumsquartier Very quiet room on top floor Decent breakfast 
377528,NH Wien City, Wifi was pretty much non existent in my room 206 The most I got was 2 bars and I only had reception at the door and one corner in the bathroom Completely unacceptable for business travelers While I added breakfast upon check in 4 out of 5 mornings the front desk cannot find it and I had to sign for it which ultimately caused a long check out as I had to re explain the breakfast charges , Location wasn t bad if you need to be in the Mariahilfer district
377529,NH Wien City, Free WiFi is slow I think it should be improved a bit , Location is great Very close to Museumquartier and few stops away from Mitte if you arrive with the CAT The hotel is hidden between two streets hence it is very quiet 
377530,NH Wien City, The outside surrounding looked a little dull , Close to the metro city centre shops restaurants and cafe s The room was very comfy and quiet Breakfast room was inviting and smart All staff were very pleasant and helpful 
377531,NH Wien City, The breakfast is getting more and more expensive the bar in the reception hall dissapeared , Very large rooms modern decorated quiet location even though it is right in the middle of Mariahilferstrasse Just outside is the Metro entrance the old city center is just 10 15 min walk 
377532,NH Wien City, The hotel building itself is nothing exciting It resembles a mid rise office building tucked among shops and a parking garage The gym is very limited a single stationary bike , Excellent location large and comfortable room Only a few steps from the lobby to a Metro stop the museum district is easily walkable Modern and clean hotel Superb value 
377533,NH Wien City, , Superior double room Actually two big double beds very clean and comfortable nice decoration Great location Nice and helpful staff Value for money Great stay 
377534,NH Wien City, very expensive price for breakfast i payed also 2 80 for 3 local phonecalls inside vienna and when i asked for a taxi to the airport they told me that is 45 euros fixed price finally i book a car from one taxi company that i found on internet with 28 euros, i stayed only 2 nights the location is is good and the young guy at the reception is a plus for the hotel helpfull guy
377535,NH Wien City, We arrived on a Saturday at about 19 30 we checked in We had a reservation The man at the front desk told us that we have to leave a guarantee of 100 for the room and parking the room on booking was 80 We gave the man 100 cash but we didn t receive any receipt When we went to check out the next morning the receptionist told us that we have to pay the room and the parking we told them that we paid the guarantee They had to call the night shift to confirm that we paid and after they told us we still have to pay the parking After I told them that we left 100 cash at the desk the man told me that he is going to throw the parking for free A very rude thing to say after the night shift wanted to make some easy cash of 19 Very disappointing , Absolutely nothing
377536,NH Wien City, Nothing special Maybe that fact that there was no TV channel in English news movies etc , Everything was very good The staff was very polite and helpful The room was the one that I asked for Very quiet and clean 
377537,NH Wien City, Fitness room very poor only 1 bike Running and step machine will be very much appreciated , The room are very big clean and comfortable Great idea microwave Great location at the exit of u bahn staff very friendly 
377538,NH Wien City, 1 Two doors between bathrooms and other rooms are hard to be closed due to disorders We asked the staff to repair it but even after repair one door was not completely closed 2 We were staying in a superior room on the 6th floor but on every morning around 6 am we were smelling something associated with breakfast being prepared at the restaurant on the 1st floor This was bad for our sense in facing good morning I often use NH hotel in Germany but have never encountered this kind of problems I would suggest the owner of this hotel to investigate disorders of furniture 3 When we checked in it was too hard to find out the entrance of the hotel I think it is better off setting a big signs near the entrance , Location is nice and it is easy and fast to access to main sightseeing spots 
377539,NH Wien City, The hotel room was a bit dark not enough lighting although it was big with a sitting room Plus the hotel doesn t have a bar if someone will have a drink a glass of wine or beer, The location of the hotel was very good breakfast fine staff helpful
377540,NH Wien City, If breakfasts were to be included that would make the best hotel I have ever been , The place was great the room was fantastic and the staff was top notch 
377541,NH Wien City, Nothing was wrong , Great location right on top of metro station and 5 mins walking from center Rooms are big and spotless Perfect for a long weekend in Vienna 
377542,NH Wien City, It would be nice to add home made yogurt and porridge for breakfasts No view from the room , Nice location for shopping Breakfasts are tasty and well decorated smoothies are super 
377543,NH Wien City,No Negative, Breakfast menus is superb and a lot of choices Room is spacious and location is just perfect Right in the Marienhilferstrasse and near the u bahn station to bring you anywhere 
377544,NH Wien City, Address of the hotel comes with email is wrong and from there at the beginning it is impossible to find the hotel entrance Real address is the next street And what comes as hotel phone in confirmation email is also wrong It is a general number for all hotels I needed to make long international calls jumping between automated answers to find out how I can find hotel entrance It was quite unpleasant after a long travel , If you manage to find the hotel everything else is good 
377545,NH Wien City, Upon checking in hotel has blocked a full stay cost on my card but upon checking out it wasn t cancelled and another full charge was made leading me to an overdraft as I didn t expect such a double charge I didn t realize the block wasn t lifted until after I left se we re yet to see if they cancel the block by my email request , Microwave oven mini fridge tea kettle in the room very useful amenities Parking nearby Location very close to railway station subway city centre Attentive and pleasant staff with a grain of salt see the minuses section 
377546,NH Wien City, Only one thing the TV had lots of channels but there was not one English speaking channel Reception said new system was being installed but that didn t help us , Very central location in the retail district close to transport metro station next to hotel Spacious apartment good coffee machine for expressos 
377547,NH Wien City, Too noisy air condition you can hear even the neighboring one Poor insulation of doors you can hear conversation in the corridor, location good wi fi
377548,NH Wien City, the breakfast was not included and we didnt know The staff didnt inform us that we had to pay extra and its like 50 Euro for one breakfast for two people This was ridiculous the buffet wasnt great at all BECAREFUL the elevator is old and slow, The room is clean and pretty big i m not sure if the other rooms are like mine the bathroom is big the location is fantastic underground is like 1 right at the building WIFI is great better than The Intercontinental where we stayed three nights before NH 
377549,NH Wien City, Staff coule be friendlier and more helpful What I really did not like was the smell of cigarettes on the ground floor in the hallway where you wait for the elevator , quite spaceous room with great king size bed Very clean room and bathroom Tip it would be nice to have a manual how to turn the shower on 
377550,NH Wien City, Bathroom floor not cleaned at all Advertised free late check out on Sundays when requested the hotel attempted to charge me 50 for it Free wi fi slower than 3g premium wi fi costs 10 day, Location Parking

377553,NH Wien City, Lobby is very basic when you sometimes just would like to unwind after a long day , Location is on a very nice shopping street and is also walking distance 15 min to the center where all the nice shops museums and restaurants are Staff are very helpful 
377554,NH Wien City, I did not like at all the bathroom and towels The sink was blocked and shoe polisher was placed used from previous guest, The location is good and also breakfast was good but very expensive
