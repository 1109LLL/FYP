183024,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, We were on the fifth floor and a couple of stairs leading to our room were very narrow which is apparently to be addressed , The staff were really lovely Top location down the road from Buckingham Palace and gardens Well dressed doormen add that special touch with caramels on the reception desk a personal favourite Georgeous lobby with a traditional feel it was my idea of what a London hotel should be that you see in the movies Breakfast was yummy too It was the best hotel that we stayed in while on our trip 
183025,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Nothing really prices where high but that related to the area but the overall quality of everything was high to match, The splendid of the hotel and the friendliness of the staff and the Location
183026,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Even though the hotel was great the price was high We also stayed at the Mad Hatter Hotel which was also very clean and quiet for half the price , Staff was very friendly and helpful Room was very clean and extremely quiet Didn t hear any noise from other rooms or the hall any of the five nights we stayed here Location was great for my conference at the QEII center Room service was available 24 hours which was great the first night we arrived 
183027,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, As stated the shower facilities need to consider all age groups , My family member was my mother this trip was to celebrate her 90th birthday The staff were excellent they went above and beyond their brief for us My only concern was the shower being over the bath making it impossible for mum to have a shower I have related this concern to the hotel who have responded very quickly with assurance it will be looked into and proposed as an improvement to consider I am overall very happy with the entire trip 
183028,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Service charge of 2 50 was charged for a buffet breakfast also a family member had 1 cup of coffee and was charged 2 50 The beds were small and very uncomfortable also the shower unit were very outdated, I liked the court yard garden
183029,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, We had 3 people in a room with one queen There was not enough room for a cot as it would be against fire code We ended up having one person sleep on the floor with extra comforters We were told that all of the other rooms were taken else they would have upgraded us I guess its something to be aware of ,No Positive
183030,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, TV did not work on arrival had to be fixed long walk to room down small corridors and the bath tub base was so curved you could not easily stand in it for a shower , Good Location nice lobby restaurants and facilities etc Great Internet and great staff

183032,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Air con was on and off a bit but that was Ok because of the weather No fan in the bathroom , Everything was very good I enjoyed my stay very much and I have booked to come back this weekend Room was very good and staff and service were also very good 
183033,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The only thing I didn t like was the very expensive price for breakfast so I ate across the street Also the hallways need to be updated to match the beauty of the lobby Very old furniture in lift areas on each floor , Great location staff were wonderful lobby is gorgeous as was the courtyard and my room which was booked as a Classic King was very large and updated and beautifully decorated and faced the courtyard Doorman opened the door took my luggage to bellman and all in all was a fantastic stay and by the time I checked into my room the luggage was already there Hotel is a couple of blocks away from the Underground both District and Circle Lines so was very easy to get around There is a little grocery store 1 2 block away and a pizzeria also 1 2 block away Directly across the street is a cafe for breakfast and lunch Did I mention it was a couple of blocks away from Buckingham Palace Very quiet and safe area Loved everything about it 
183034,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Nothing , We didn t like the view from our first room so I asked to be moved they were very accommodating Breakfast was excellent included in our price The hotel was beautiful including the courtyard We had drinks there Everything was wonderful 
183035,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, We changed rooms three times we had booked a king room but had been downgraded to a queen The room wasn t great and the bathroom very dated with a window that didn t close The second room was non smoking but smelled of cigarette smoke and again wasn t good The third room was fine but the bathrooms are so dated We had however booked a classic room if booking I would advise to pay the extra for a contemporary room a lot of work is needed on the classic rooms to bring them up to standard , Good staff nice communal area valet parking is a plus if travelling by car to this hotel 
183036,St James Court A Taj Hotel London,No Negative, Great location and relatively good value for money for London Staff very attentive helpful Rooms not massive but NFL Normal for London Well appointed though bed comfortable and shower powerful and hot which are most important to me when travelling on business
183037,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, This was out of the hotel s control but there was a large construction project directly adjacent to our room It would have been nice to have been notified about this before arriving so we could have asked for a room away from it There is apparently a school s playground adjacent to the hotel and our room 274 so the sounds of young boys at play in the mornings coupled with the ongoing heavy construction made for an unusual wake up calls each weekday morning Maybe the hotel should consider updating its room windows to be more modern energy efficient and sound proof , The staff and the location Can t say enough about either 
183038,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Check in is always super slow and inefficient and there are always people having issues with something or other Not sure if its their systems or what but never smooth ,No Positive
183039,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The original attitude to my complaints was harsh I was shown a room different room that was worse than the first and then shown a room that I was told I could have if I paid more It was only until our last night that things were put right due to the kindness and understanding of the House Manager , The first three days were a disappointment as our room was nothing like the photo on the web I did complain however arrangements to move us to a proper room were only for our last night The house manager made every effort to make it special and because of him I would stay there again however only if I could make a specific room request 
183040,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, the air conditioner could have been a bit cooler, The staff were very friendly the buffet breakfast had a lot of variety the room was very clean Nice and close to all the tourist sites close to the tube station 
183041,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Not enough British power outlets to go round we had several chargers working for our cell phone two Garmin watches and our laptop Two chargers were under the suitcase bench and could only be accessed by lying down on the floor Hot water ran through towel racks in the bathroom and it was adding heat to the entire suite despite air conditioning Only window that opened was in the bathroom and out to the courtyard and so getting air moving was limited too settings on the thermostat A very old hotel but on the whole it was simply a treat to be staying there , Obviously a very elite hotel with staff falling all over you but some other guests and visitors a little less friendly I got in trouble with a FaceTime visit that came in on my cell phone from my daughter back in Canada a chance to see my first grandchild for the first time But someone complained I guess I was too happy in the formal setting Also got in trouble for asking for ice at the bar for handling a knee injury while walking London all day They had given me a small bag of ice with no problems before so other than that a first class place in a first class city 
183042,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, room elevator, excellent location of the hotel but our room was located in a different building with small scary elevator didn t feel comfortable in there Room itself was ok nothing special Location is the key in this hotel

183047,St James Court A Taj Hotel London,No Negative, Our original hotel was fully booked so we were given a free upgrade to St Buckingham Gate Hotel where we were given a king junior suite room worth 250 more per night We were given a friendly and welcoming tour around the hotel and the facilities everything was good it was clean and there was always a good vibe I rate my experience as 10 10

183054,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, When I checked in to my room there was a bottle of Prosecco in an ice bucket a bottle of water and a fruit basket along with a letter addressed to another guest I called down to Reception to let them know so that the other guest wouldn t be disappointed when the items were not in his room and was told that these are for a special guest and we will come and remove them immediately This is not how I expect a 5 hotel to deal with a matter such as this I m not particularly bothered about the prosecco and fruit but the inference that other guests were special and therefore I am not was not how I wanted to start my start at the hotel True to their word someone arrived immediately and removed all the items reiterating once again that they were for a special guest I was disappointed with the room fixtures and fittings it was akin to a 3 hotel than a 5 I usually stay in The Landmark The Royal Horseguards St Martins Lane The Grosvenor and there is absolutely no comparison And the state of the fourth floor public areas had to be seen to be believed The carpet didn t look like it had been vacuumed for weeks with bits all over it and thick layers on dirt on some of the door architraves and skirting boards I reported both the Prosecco incident and the dirty appearance of the fourth floor carpet to Mr Andrea the Duty Manager I couldn t understand what his response was in all honesty as he has a very heavy accent but it clearly wasn t a satisfactory outcome as nothing was done about anything When I left the hotel two days later the same bits were all over the carpet I was asked on checking out whether I had enjoyed my stay I replied no but I have already explained this to the Duty Manager and the gentleman on reception said that he would apologise to me as no one else had , The service and the food in the Bistro Restaurant were very good

183060,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Room was quite old and it was hard to get to The hallway was narrow and our room was at the end of the corridor so it was hard to manoeuvre the stroller When booking I didn t realise that this is more of a business hotel and we had the only baby during our stay The location is good if you re planning on using the underground , The hotel provided a bottle steriliser for our baby which is rare This was so useful Staff were friendly and helpful

183082,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, It is mega expensive partly because of its central London location At a price well north of 300 per night is it too much to expect flannels to be provided in the bathroom Air con was noisy A sales convention was going on there during our stay with sales reps taking up many rooms and business displays about communal areas Not a relaxing environment Ground floor atmosphere very similar to Euston Station , Chosen for its location which was exactly where we wanted but it to be

183133,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The room was really really far from the elevator you literally go from corridor to corridor for minutes The room has seen better times you can see that it has some years maybe it would be time for some renovations When I checked in I had to pre pay 50 pounds per days of stay in case I used the mini fridge or had some drinks at the hotel bar which I personally find not necessary at all as it is a very high amount Most hotels ask you after check out if you took something from the mini fridge which in my opinion is the way to go , The bed was comfortable and room was spacious Breakfast was until 11 30 which is awesome if you compare it to other hotels 
183134,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, THE NOISE We were next to a housekeeping cupboard that seemed to be in constant use We were disturbed during the evening and night by a persistently creaking door the receptionist thought it was probably caused by a breeze through the fire door Sunday afternoon I needed to rest but the noise from the rooms above was awful Sounded like laundry trucks being rolled around I wouldn t recommend this hotel and frankly feel the 455 for a two night stay without breakfast was excessive Very disappointing , Comfy bed Lovely linen

183145,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The room was small with tiny tiny awfully outdated bathroom Plus the room absolutely stunk no other word to describe this really of cigarette smoke at night which probably came through the ventilation This is a huge no no definitely not in line with the hotel claimed start rating Was planning to book a week s stay in July but due to this disappointing experience I will not be doing that , Great location friendly staff lovely reception decor

183147,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Housekeeping staff is filthy She wiped my basin with the same gloves used to retrieve something that fell into the toilet bowl I didn t even ask her to wipe the basin she dipped her hands in the toilet bowl and wiped my basin touched my soap and toothbrush with the same gloves when I objected she started arguing All the senior manager could do was say sorry for the inconvenience She took my dustbin to clear and never got it back despite me calling twice I had to throw my personal toiletries away because of the incident was disgusted to use the bathroom for the remaining two days I was there so I was using the common toilet in the lobby Also spent two days without a dustbin in the room Also the housekeeping staff is slow and inattentive I call asking for body wash and they sent me lotion I call asking for bath towels and they sent me hand towels I was delayed for two meetings on two days on account of this Never staying here again, The only thing I liked was the menu and the in room dining staff service was good 
183148,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, We were a bit dissatisfied with our check in experience We had contacted the hotel not once but twice regarding our request for an early check in we asked for 12 noon as opposed to 2pm as my wife needed to go to a foot procedure nearby and she needed to scrub her feet clean prior to leaving for the clinic Upon arrival we were told the room was clean but not inspected yet We were then 10 minutes later told that the room was in fact not ready nor had it been inspected 10 minutes after that we were told that it was ready I explained to Karen the gal who checked us in that we needed the bags immediately as the special soap my wife needed was inside Several minutes went by before the bags arrived This all put us in a time crunch and the stress of this added to the stress of the day unfortunately Upon check out again there was an issue We were asked if we wanted the additional charges about 211 to be charged in euros or in GBP We thought it would be nice to have it charged in Euros as our bank would not charge a fee that way So we said Euros We were then given a receipt for 211 My wife asked how much that was in Euros since that was the currency we were charged in The gal at the desk said she did not know My wife asked her to find out She said she could not My wife asked again for her to find out The gal at check out asked a colleague and he said he could not give us a receipt in Euros My wife replied that she did not need a receipt in Euros but that she DID need to know how much was charged in Euros The fellow at reception then gave the gal who was helping us some instruction to look at a currency converter but the gal did not seem to know what she was doing or how to do that My wife then asked to speak to the manager on duty The gal went into the back for a few minutes and returned to let my wife know that the MOD was on the telephone understand all of this was with my wife STANDING with crutches , Sunaina Soares Assistant Front Office Manager made herself known to us when she saw my wife on crutches She was introduced to us by a lovely lady don t know her name who we think was the designer at the hotel That evening she sent us some lovely fruit which we did not have time to eat unfortunately Additionally we did enjoy our cocktails in the Hampton s Bar both evenings of our stay our breakfasts both mornings of our stay and room service dinner the first night of our stay although a few items were a bit on the bland side 
183149,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The bed was smaller than we are used to so in future I would book a king but it was still comfy and no problem , We really enjoyed our stay here wish we had stayed for the whole trip rather than changing to the Mondrian The hotel had a classic style and the rooms had a good size for London The bar was very comfy and the breakfast was good I can t remember his name but a Romanian gent who worked breakfast was very polite and helpful each morning St James Court felt like very good value for money in comparison to other hotels in London We would definitely stay again

183168,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Your advertisement was not accurate Your website stated that breakfast would be included in the booking but when we checked in we were told it was not This cost an extra 22 each This made the stay more expensive than the hotel direct or other sites, Position

183185,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The selection in the mini bar I have a preference of neat spirits and there was no option , Only flaw was that the pain au chocolat with the champagne breakfast was a bit stale But because of the stay as a whole it was easily forgotten about

183194,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Wifi signal didn t extend to my room and despite reporting it they took five hours to find a solution which was to plug a signal booster into a socket in my room How can a hotel these days have rooms which are outside of their internet network Also I have PTSD and the constant rumbling rattling of the underground trains running underneath the hotel was very disturbing and prevented a restful stay , Location is brilliant

183323,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, This hotel looked great upon arrival but behind the lobby it was a little tired Corridors were grubby and in need of a re paint The bathroom in our room was very dated The bar closed at 10 40pm on a Friday night leaving the very pricey Hampton bar as the only option where a glass of wine was 9 with a 2 service charge despite the fact we stood at the bar and the guy only handed it to us , Gorgeous cocktails and the lobby was beautiful staff were very friendly Our bed a large King was supercomfy and our room was a good size 
183324,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The window of our room was directly above a noisy hotel generator which kept us awake all night When we complained about this we were offered a pathetic 50 as a goodwill gesture instead of proper discount that more properly reflected the discomfort we had experienced , Nice old building 
183325,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Standards have really dropped in the past few months slow bar service inappropriate serving staff at breakfast and clearly cutting corners Bathrobes are fine if you are a child of 8 tiny , Location

183332,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Initially we were over run with staff x three asking if we were comfortable dinner once served was lovely perfectly cooked The restaurant staff were too quick to clear the table away and clearly wanted us out of the restaurant though it was only 9 30pm we were the last people in the restaurant but even so When filling glasses the waitress continually only topped up one of the glasses when two of were drinking wine Requested water which arrived and was placed on the side but rarely did the waitress top up the water glasses the Spa closed too early,No Positive

183334,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, I had thought breakfast was included but it wasn t Feel this should be confirmed at reception desk when booking in which would have avoided embarrassment later , Convenient situation helpfulness of staff lovely cosy room etc etc 
183335,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, I prefer breakfast to be included in the rate Its not cheap My room was a bit old fashioned esp bathroom fittings and decor Therefore undervalue Altho clean room I did notice odour from pillows not pillow case they were changed next day but I could still smell odour so not the case but the pillow , The public areas are beautiful The location great I would stay here again if better room lol Staff are to be commended 
183336,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Corridors old and worn music in bar is good but too loud generally a bit more attention to small details would make big impression on customers no kleenex in bathroom coffee and milk just small points where hotel mangagement can do better No criticism implied of staff in front positions , convenient location polite staff nice room internet bathroom clean drink served in bar was very very very disappointing Get a good bar tender 
183337,St James Court A Taj Hotel London,No Negative, The staff were really helpful and friendly It was a birthday surprise for my husband they even bought a beautifully decorated piece of cake to our room which was a lovely surprise 
183338,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Expensive room ridiculously small Told absolutely no more rooms available Air filters turned off for noise smell of ash tray made us realise we d been wrongly put in smoking room Was moved to same priced room half as big again Cynical Room service is more expensive than mini bar but you get service charge on top of that Cooked breakfast was dry and tasteless and not 26 but 29 25 with service charge ,No Positive
183339,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Breakfast finished earlier than we would have liked Tempting goodies placed in room that you had to pay extra for Took a bit of time to find our room , Room and bed very comfy Excellent breakfast 
183340,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The bed mattress is not comfortable, The room is spacious and the service is very good quite nights and plenty of resturants in the hotels that have a variety of options suits every taste 
183341,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Couldn t have a bath as the auto sink plug wouldn t close Very poor and scarce tea coffee selection in the room just one biscuit not actually a good starter for a guest , My major like was the comfort of the room The location for me was paramount as I go every year to march at the Cenotaph so this hotel is very close to Horseguards It is warm and cosy great food but quite pricey Staff are very well trained and extremely friendly and helpful although a few could really brush up on their English 
183342,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, This hotel was over priced it seems that te online rating for this hotel is not fair Anyways the room they have given me at first night was not the room of offering Queen size bed in the room while the offer was a king size bed After i become aware they ve changed the room but did nothing to cover their mistake, Since it was over price i don t have any specific point to mention
183343,St James Court A Taj Hotel London,No Negative, Bed super comfy Room spacious had everything we needed including a kettle and safe Lovely outside courtyard that was a bit of an oasis in central London Great location for lots of top sights Buckingham Palace south bank Big Ben etc
183344,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The sofa in the room was not very comfortable although the fabric was spotless and obviously quite new There was a slight odour in the room at first as though someone had been smoking or vaping in there We ate at The Bank one night and the food was excellent but I had to ask to be moved as there was a cold draught through the glass doors and I was still not really comfortably warm at the table we moved to , The location is superb for the Buckingham Palace Westminster part of London Car parking service was reasonably priced and very useful The staff are generally very helpful The suite was large with everything clean and well presented e g the TV was modern with a good choice of channels The bed was very comfortable We have used the hotel before and will certainly use it again 
183345,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, On first morning of our stay when i ordered my breakfast i got phone call from the restaurant manager asking me why do i need so much of food Confirmed with her that i need everything that i ordered And after 10 minutes got another call from the cheif about the same thing I was asked so many questions about my breakfast that i had to cancel the order Very disappointing No one got the right to ask a customer why want to eat certain things or quantity Poor and disappointing, Bad experience
183346,St James Court A Taj Hotel London,No Negative, An amazing hotel that did not disappoint in any way old style charm and service with new world conveniences Everything that I needed as a business traveler close by the St James subway free and fast internet access spacious room with great desk set up and wonderful fitness center Several great restaurants enjoyed the Kona Restaurant on my last night the menu marries traditional cooking techniques with contemporary styling unpretentious yet elegant I felt at home throughout my stay 
183347,St James Court A Taj Hotel London,No Negative, Concierge and reception staff were very helpful and made sure I felt welcome from the very second I walked through the door Was recommended by a family member and will definitely be staying again come the New Year 
183348,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Bathroom would need a renovation My room was in the end of the corridor which takes nearly 4min regular speed walking distance from the elevator passing by all the corners of the floor Might be not easy with people with reduced mobility Internet dropped down all the time I believe it was location issue as well , Great location Very comfortable bed Caring staff members from reception to cleaning 
183349,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The bed was too hard a few more plugs would be useful , Very helpful friendly staff Fairly priced restaurants Lovely quiet room Lovely soft cotton linen bathrobes and slippers provided Free wifi 
183350,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Nothing, This was our 4th time of staying at St James Court We stayed at the hotel for two nights as part of my 50th birthday weekend The hotel staff were friendly and extremely helpful We stayed in a suite which was fabulous Breakfast was lovely too I thoroughly recommend this hotel It is fantastic 
183351,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Wasn t info about breakfast till you ate it and it was expensive bathroom dirty talked into up grading room when it wasn t necessary as only a bigger bed I presume drinks Menu complicated and fussy messed up my bill on departure for some reason gave up trying to understand the reason so I ve got to check my account to see if it s all sorted in a couple of days I think it just wasn t personable enough , The decor in the lobby and facilities available 
183352,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Our room was not the best we have stayed in and for 180 we expected more Our room overlooked the generators and they were very noisy especially at night when we opened our window for ventilation Also there must have been a water tank above our room so all night we were kept awake by water noise In the morning we wanted to have a bath but the water was tepid and only just hot enough to have a shower instead , Could not fault the hotel facilities staff and the best breakfast we have had in a long time 
183353,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, room dusty and no information of check out times had house cleaning knocking on door at 10am and then again at 11am, hotel appearance looked lovely and reception etc very clean and welcoming staff very good we were allowed the room earlier concierge offered to hold bags if wanted to go off on our business before even knowing if room ready 
183354,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Concierge can be more helpful Don t just answer questions Be more forthcoming by giving helpful suggestions , Room service was super especially as I had an unexpected guest staying over for a night
183355,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, low ceilings Dirty outdated rooms Shower head was awful Business centre was terrible with too many low ceiling corridors Annoying front desk with the person in charge telling off colleagues Faucets fallings off in bathroom food selection in room service was poor , location Room service was ok A jacket I had left was safely sent to an address in London 
183356,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, A bit of a walk to the tube stations , Great location excellent facilities and the restaurant food and service were tops The room we had was huge and extremely comfortable Couldn t have stayed in a better hotel 
183357,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Seems like maintenance could be a bit better , Our first room did not have very hot water and smelled of cigarettes through the vents We asked to change rooms an we re placed in a lovely room that same day Overall a good experience 
183358,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Had to queue for about 20 minutes to have breakfast on Saturday morning at about 10 00 There seemed to be enough tables but not enough staff to handle the guests , The superior room we had was excellent We like the bar area which is essentially an extension of the lobby 
183359,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Luke warm coffee at breakfast Added discretionary charges in Bistro at lunchtime Would have liked a choice , Lovely atmosphere in the foyerand Hampton bar especially with jazz pianist on Saturday evening Attentive and helpful staff Knowledgeable concierge and prompt service by smart doorman Fabulous breakfast in the Bistro Lovely lunch at the Kona restaurant 
183360,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The reception and outer appearance were to a high standard but once you get to your room it feels like a different building The room felt quite dated Overall it was an ok experience but not worth the money your charged In my opinion your paying for the area more so ,No Positive
183361,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Would have expected a pool and better spa facilities for such a large hotel There was only one very small sauna and steam room which was a little disappointing , Location was excellent the staff were very friendly and accommodating and the bar offered well priced cocktails during happy hour 
183362,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Mini bar in room ridiculously expensive 7 for a litre of water Quite a bit of traffic noise on lower floors , Gym is very good Reception staff very helpful Good sized room comfortable bed 
183363,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The bathroom wasn t the cleanest the bathtub itself had that grimy line around it like someone just got out the tub The room service was quick with our nightcap but they were warm with no ice We asked for ice and it never arrived They are little things but the bill isn t so its disappointing , The bed was comfy the room was a good size and the food was good 
183364,St James Court A Taj Hotel London,No Negative, Excellent staff at hotel and desk Eva at the Kona is very professional and kind Tom at the Bank was helpful Ideal location for a walk via the Palace to Pall Mall and Piccadilly Although there are many rooms the hotel feels cosy 
183365,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Rubbish rooms that smelt bad Had to be moved twice Took them almost an hour to get me my car and then three staff turned up in it Seems they all like to have a go in an Aston Martin , Nothing that much
183366,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, For a disabled traveller the doors were very heavy to manoeuvre Facilities could have been made excellent by the addition of a bed pole There was a problem with the shower door falling off but it was swiftly rectified Some of the paint work shows signs of needing a touch up but this is fairly minor , Pleasant staff who took an interest in those staying longer than 2 3 nights Capacious and clean rooms Excellent menu in bistro Hamptons area very pleasant 
183367,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Some repairs on the bathroom are needed roof and wall tiles and small wallpaper issues on the main room , The staff was friendly and helpful Quiet room with an inside view 
183368,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, I was given a smoking room so remember to ask for a non smoking one if this bothers you It bothered me a bit , The overall quality of the hotel and staff was excellent It is extremely well located with Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace only a short walk away 
183369,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Hear was not good in room Kept going from hot to cold Room phone had a loose cable so couldn t hear well Need plugs by bed for mobiles , Staff are extremely helpful and friendly Bed was amazingly comfortable Room service Just do it 
183370,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Room looked onto dark courtyard drab and dull no outlook and no views of famous courtyard they rate so highly did not see it at all, Friendly staff
183371,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The best way to describe the Hotel is like a man with a black tie with dirty underwear The place smells of curry all the time bathroom far too small Concierge very BAD manners , Location and quite area
183372,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, First room shown was very small and pokey no parking on site congested road, Super attentive staff quiet rooms choice of eating venues extensive menus nice toiletries good lighting
183373,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Shower curtain smelled a bit like mildew, Loved the staff and location Short walk to St James tube station One reviewer said his room shook from the tube We NEVER heard or felt the tube Nice quiet location too 
183374,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, On arrival we were offered help with our luggage which we politely declined however it would have been nice if the gentleman on reception had gone on to explain that there were a couple of steps in between the lift on the 6th floor and our bedroom door we might have changed our mind The bar area is lovely but feels a little squashed into the back of the reception area and slightly unwelcoming but there s not a lot you can really do about that other than move it completely I would add that a cold breakfast at 20 each even more if you wanted a cooked breakfast was very steep especially as there are numerous eateries in the area offering breakfast for far less I am sure the breakfast was sublime but at over 45 a morning for the two of us it simply wasn t going to happen , The staff were excellent available 24 7 and always happy to help with a smile They offer real customer service with bells on can t rate them highly enough The hotel is absolutely beautiful very old school luxury grand building with a grand reception area leading into the Hamptons bar The location is very central and everything you would want to see as a tourist is within walking distance or a short tube ride The room was large for London we had a standard double and it was cleaned every day with the chocolates refreshments and toiletries replaced automatically The Hamptons bar offered some lovely food after 11pm when we got back from our evening at the theatre The Quilon restaurant is amazing the service is incredible the food delightful We both went with the taster menu and loved it I was rather daunted at the prospect of eating in a one Michelin starred restaurant but the waiting staff and manager could not have been more welcoming or attentive We will be back to the hotel hopefully before the year is out 
183375,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, This is a 3 star product masquerading as something else The rooms were tired musty and small yet the price was ridiculous There s yield management and yield management but in this case Taj should hang its head in shame This is a case that falls nothing short of misrepresentation and OTA s such as Booking com should exercise extreme caution with product description , The staff were helpful but embarrassed by the quality of the product 
183376,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Noisy lobby lounge with restricted seating , Quiet excellent beds good lighting choice of eating venues wide selection of foods and drink character of hotel helpfulness of staff amenities 
183377,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The room we had wasn t cared for both windows had curtains that weren t properly attached to the rails The bathroom mirror wasn t cleaned properly These are minor details but in a 5 star hotel I expect more detailed care to be taken Breakfast was a shambles lukewarm coffee barely warm food part of the order taking ages However I did complain and my complaint was listened to and dealt with satisfactorily , The staff were all friendly polite and helpful Our room was a good size pleasantly furnished and quiet Although I felt I paid a fair rate for what I got I was surprised the hotel was 5 star Needs to pay attention to the details 
183378,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The hotel put a hold on my credit card for an extremely high amount citing incidentals that I might incur over our stay In my experience a hotel charges guests for costs incurred AFTER they leave not before purchasing This hold was not stipulated in any reservation information beforehand and put an undue hardship on my finances Housekeeping on most days was pretty good but service differed by staff And I am still appalled that regardless of cost per night at every calibre of hotel housekeeping staff still cut corners For example not providing clean glasses that have been put through a dishwasher due to the time it takes to remove and replace glasses from multiple rooms over large distances Instead it s common practice for housekeepers to wash rinse glasses and cups in room and dry then out with a rag This was most certainly the case at the Taj The thing that displeased me the most but was positively remedied by the head housekeeper or night manager was that during the day one housekeeper unpacked our grocery bag removing some stuff and keeping other stuff This resulting in us losing some of our purchased items Never should hotel staff unpack a guest s belongings and make decisions about what s good and what should be thrown out Not terribly soundproof Fireproof doors can t be pulled shut so people just walk away from room doors which then slam shut which are loud enough to shake the walls , Overall This is a very large hotel so people s experiences will likely vary depending on which part of the hotel they were in The Taj has spent a lot of money making its common areas very elegant but our room did not reflect that same level of attention to detail best described as slated for updating because the chair was stained with worn fabric we could see touch up paint on patched drywall the bathroom didn t have a fan so ceiling had black marks from too much humidity I realize London s expensive but there s no way I would ve paid what I did at this hotel for a comparable hotel in Canada The room although dated with window s facing a schoolyard basketball court separated from us by razor wire was likely far more roomy than other hotels in the area based on reviews I ve read Room was very spacious Mattress was comfy enough although it seems that many hotels in England simply bandaid mattresses in need of replacing by putting more toppers on them Staff very friendly and accommodating Came to immediately address any issues I called about 
183379,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Casaunts seemed like they were out of a packet stuck together rather than flaking Passages with messy wallpaper spoilt the overall feel of hotel more like a 2 star in certain areas Shame as the rest is very nice , Lovely room and down stairs area 
183380,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, I can honestly say there wasn t anything we didn t like apart from having to go home , Everything about this hotel from the very friendly and attentive staff to the comfort of the room the cleanliness of the whole establishment the delicious food I noticed they cater for different nationalities cultures and dietary requirements the facilities everything was first rate and spot on This hotel is smart and luxurious yet you felt at home at ease mainly due to the polite and approachable staff who made you feel so welcome Great location so close to fantastic sights and the tube but so quiet and relaxing inside the hotel that it was easy to forget you were in London a busy and bustling city We will definitely stay here again hopefully soon We love it 
183381,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Bathroom floors were stained and had a sour smell Small entry because of sink Noise from outside all night Location was not near King cross as Booking had directed 30 cab fare Price was not up to value , Staff exceptional Lobby very well put together
183382,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Not enough space in the main restaurant for breakfast however they did have very nice alternative , Beautiful hotel lovely staff and amazing location Hotel food is outstanding and good value for money Would definitely stay again

183384,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Shower head Just hanging in it s cradle Wouldn t stay in position and had to be held by hand Expected in a hotel of this calibre that the housekeeping staff would notice such things , Staff Leonard in the bar Doormen helpful and friendly 
183385,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, the executive room was a little smaller than i expected I believe they charged me more then advertised but they said a security deposit amount was held it has been almost 4 days and i haven t seem a change so we will see the view from our room was not good , The staff was very helpful and polite the location was excellent we never spent more then 25 for a cab and walking around central London was easy too The restaurant within the hotel was classy and the food was excellent the hotel was beautiful and it always had a buzz in the atmosphere whether it was other guests or business men conducting private meeting right in the bar area 
183386,St James Court A Taj Hotel London,No Negative, We have stayed here before and love it we had a corner room with a view of the courtyard which was lovely comfy bed and spacious bathroom as well We ate in the Kona restaurant on the first night of our stay and it was nice although there were only two tables occupied so a little low in atmosphere We love this location as it is quiet but very easy to walk to Piccadilly Covent Garden etc Also easy to get cabs we went to a concert in Brixton and got a cab there which was great The staff are very helpful we will definitely stay here again 
183387,St James Court A Taj Hotel London,No Negative, Great location great value for money really enjoyed the breakfast Very helpful lobby bar entertainment was very good all in all a very nice hotel
183388,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Rather impersonable and very poor service in the bar so much so we didn t even get served so left and went out for a drink instead , Concierge was very good and polite
183389,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, they gave me a room that wasn t clean still had someone else s toiletries in there then they gave me another room after i refused to go back to that one which was smaller and had a stain on the bedspread do not be fooled by the pictures you see on their page the hotel is quite old from what i could tell , the doormen and concierge were very helpful reception not so much 
183390,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, By accident I left behind my iPad and charging wires on the desk in my room When I realized after check out that I had done this I called the hotel and was reassured that they had been found and would be held for me I am disturbed though that a hotel of this quality would not have called me immediately upon discovering my valuable item It certainly would have put me at ease and I might have been able to retrieve it before leaving for the airport , The location room and staff 
183391,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Cannot find fault with this hotel, Every staff member from check in to check out was so friendly and greeted us warmly Beautiful room overlooking courtyard and very quiet Fantastic selection for breakfast In a great location Both myself my partner were celebrating our birthday and they sent a birthday cake to the room which was a really nice touch Thank you 
183392,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Room 879 dated drab and dusty Horrific acid urine staffs around toilet Felt like we were in s different hotel not impressed , Loved the public areas very stylish furnishings staff pleasant 
183393,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The hotel smells all the time like spices and food The room was small but the bathroom was tiny No windows or aspirator in the bathroom When we checked in they had forgotten to empty the bin Overall overpriced for what it has to offer , The bed is small but comfortable 
183394,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, THE ROOM WAS NOT TO THE STANDARD I AM USED TO WHEN I AM IN LONDON TWICE A MONTH IT WAS NOT CLEAN THE BATHROOM WAS NOT CLEAN WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE CLEANLINESS OF THE ROOM DID NOT MAKE THE STAY ENJOYABLE ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAD BOOKED THIS TO CELEBRATE MY PARTNERS BIRTHDAY , THE STAFF WERE AMAZING THE HOTEL LOCATION IS GREAT

183398,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, I was upgraded against my wishes An amount was authorised on my card which was more than I had booked for I was told it would be refunded I then paid the agreed amount for the room the next day When I got home I realised the previous amount was still missing from my account I phoned the hotel and they said it was a system error In future I will be refusing all upgrades very loudly and clearly I paid over twice for my stay and am still waiting to be reimbursed , The location is excellent and the room was lovely 
183399,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Very close a school so a bit noisy in the morning As mentioned in other reviews rooms are a bit outdated Service charge is added to everything even when you buy a drink at a bar Roy the bar manager was very rude which appalling for a 4 start hotel in central London , Good location close to Buckingham palace Hyde park and Southbank Reception staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay

183402,St James Court A Taj Hotel London,No Negative, The location was great Easy walking distance to Buckingham Palace Hyde Park and some wonderful restaurants Also close to an underground which made travelling further super easy 
183403,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, As with a lot of London hotels asking up to 30 quid for breakfast and nearly 7 quid for a pint is beyond the boundaries of sanity so I went elsewhere for meals and drinks , room was very quiet with no outside noise coming in 
183404,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Even by the standards of Central London the bar prices were very high and included a default tip , Comfortable room with all facilities Helpful staff 
183405,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Was not impressed with some of the staff I needed to stay another day and was very abruptly told by a front desk person that the hotel was booked up She didn t even bother to check I then checked myself on Booking com and found at least three rooms available , Hotel is beautiful and location is great 
183406,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The food is way too expensive and we did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants except Quilon We were supposed to get a view of the courtyard or maybe a partial view but we got 0 view of the courtyard The view was terrible The bedroom was a little cramped , The location was fabulous Close to the Tube and many restaurants Walking distance to Buckingham Palace and other sites we came to see The staff was friendly and helpful The sitting room and bathroom were spacious 
183407,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The bed wasn t especially comfortable and the high tech lighting was too complicated for me to understand Same with the heating and cooling We never did figure out the television For the cost of one night I was hoping for a bit more actual luxury and not just the appearances of it The staff made you feel like a star but the actual accomodations were a bit wanting for star quality , The rooms was spacious and it was a King sized bed very hard to find in the UK It was very clean and we had a view of the courtyard The staff were extremely friendly and accomodating The location is awesome just blocks from the Parliament buildings and Westminster Abbey 
183408,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Everything was great , The room was pleasant and clean and the bed was very comfortable The location to London attractions was excellent Staff was friendly and courteous 
183409,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Infrastructure is pretty and nostalgic but in practical use sometimes really old e g the windows did not close properly and there was noise from a part in the courtyard , Location Ambience
183410,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Just a slight problem on the last day The seal came loose around the shower door and it was a challenge to keep the water in the tub during the shower Aside from this minor problem we would definitely stay at St James Court again , The whole room was very comfortable and staff very accommodating and pleasant

183458,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, I was so disappointed Having stayed at the Taj Dubai I was really looking forward to my stay However the Taj St James was a complete disappointment We were moved three times in ten days because we complained Firstly because of the filthy room that we were put into Classic Studio 261 then because of the noise from a guest in the room above 361 and the third room was an upgrade to a contemporary style suite which smelt of smoke Very very disappointing We should have been relocated to a better standard of room after the first room that we were allocated Pubic hair visible in the bathroom suspicious staining on the couch and the bed cover The Hotel is tired and needs a makeover The furnishings have past their best by a number of years , The location was outstanding Central to everything you want to see in London Five minutes walk to Buckingham Palace 15 minutes to Westminster Abbey Fantastic

183461,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The bathroom In particular the shower over a bath that was so narrow that the shower curtain was impossible to avoid The base of the bath was not flat making standing uncomfortable For a hotel of this quality I would have expected a walk in shower wet room , The ambiance the piano the restaurants on site

183465,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The room was tiny we stayed in room 755 which was on a corner The bed wasn t even a full size double i m 5ft 6 and my feet were almost hanging off the edge The room was clean and tidy but very very dated The bottom half of the window was painted up and the top half looked out onto a cladded wall Having paid 369 00 for the two nights I think that it is very poor value for money , Nice atmosphere
183466,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Upon arrival the reception for some reason took a deposit out of my card which later on did not show on the room statement It was only after I upon return contacted credit control of the hotel that the issue was cleared Such things are annoying time consuming and should not be necessary at a 5 star hotel The size of the executive King room I had was not impressive although the window orientation towards a quiet yard and in different directions was a great plus I could have the windows open at night being only 300 meters from the Palace without being greatly disturbed by the regular sirens in London from the police and ambulances When walking inside the room wearing black socks I discovered quite some residuals from former guests in the room who must have been long haired blondes Half of the king bed turned out to be broken or severely impacted by former activities which had crumbled the springs This can be looked at as an impressive feat but for me as a guest at a 5 star establishment it is disappointing that it is not being reported by the maintenance staff and the room will be handed over to new clients in a non optimal state The hotel should probably also take better care of the technical installations having only two smaller lifts available for guests having one of them out of service during peak hours for checkout after the weekend is just irritating On the auxiliary side with the hotel in the location it has 2 min walk from the House of Fraser down Buckingham Gate it is slightly disappointing that the hotel does not go the extra mile no just a few feet really to enhance the guests experience by providing a discount arrangement for the House of Fraser or similar , The location is excellent You are in walking distance of any part of St James Mayfair Whitehall etc and the tube station St James Park is literally an easy 5 minute walk from the hotel 
183467,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Our check in day was a nightmare We had to wait two hours for the room to be prepared and received the room key two hours later than the time indicated as the check in on on the hotel web site The receptionist a tall East Indian man promised to call me on my cell phone when the room was ready After waiting for over an hour and a half and not receiving any calls I inquired about our room and a young lady stated to me that the room was ready The room initially assigned to us by the eastern Indian receptionist was next to the corridor being painted The entire floor smelt like a construction site To make the matter worse once we entered the room we found two travel bags which belonged to someone else Our travel bags to my astonishment had not been delivered to our room within two hours after the bags were picked up and we had to wait for the room Clarifying the matter with the same eastern Indian receptionist who promised to fight be our bags I requested a different room away from the area of the hotel being repainted Well after the same gent gave us the key to the room on the top roof floor we found ourselves in a room much smaller that the room we reserved There was no mention of the price difference due to the size difference either Still awaiting the bags to be found and almost three hours past the time we were supposed to be relaxing in our room after a long flight I finally had enough and asked to speak to the manager She was the only one who understood and immediately got involved and soon resolved the problems with missing bags and found a big nice room for us I am still stunned by that day as I never in my life has seen such a delay and such incompetence from the receptionist , The manager s Mrs Perez s skills to solve the problems on our first day at the hotel Complimentary Water in the rooms Comfortable beds and politeness 
183468,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Quality of shower for a prestigious property was very poor no water pressure to speak of yet water pressure in sink and toilet was fine, location was excellent for getting around walking distance to Houses of Parliament and main line station s

183477,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The room had water leak stains on ceiling and the pillow was really uncomfortable The breakfast selection was small compared to other hotels I have stayed at The picture frames were not related to the taj and the history of the taj The room was small and the TV was at an angle therefore difficult to watch from bed The shower didn t have much power and the bath plug didn t fit well therefore water slipped through slowly , The hotel had so much character and it was a decent hotel Food was good too enjoyed spinach with chicken and lamb sheek kebab one of the best I have ever had Nice bathroom Good location 5 mins walk from Green park st James park 20mins walk away from National Gallery

183484,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Our room was obviously an ex smoking room as you could smell it but not too much of a problem The Zander bar could do with some atmosphere and parts of the hotel were needing upgrading , The preparations for my husband s birthday were exactly as planned and the food was exquisite 
183485,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Room smelt like vomit Had to change rooms but only able to after first night Rooms shabby eg peeling and stained wall paper Poor plumbing bath filled up when showering, Location was good
183486,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The bed wasn t the best for comfort Bathroom wasn t the best I ve seen better in cheaper hotels Broken tiles not fully replaced just both half s stuck back on I m sure this hotel offers some stunning rooms but they aren t given to booking com customers who get a discount on rooms by the looks of it , Food was excellent had fish chips which was delicious English breakfast was lovely as well Staff really nice and friendly also this hotel is in an idea location for anyone looking to explore London with tube on it s doorstep as well as Buckingham Palace Hyde Park London Eye Big Ben Westminster etc

183490,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, As above, The public areas of the hotel were of a high standard and no doubt there are rooms to match Standard rooms are in desperate need of an update Flaking paint damp signs in bathroom which is very small and has no extractor fan there is also a smell from the drains throughout the hotel 
183491,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Really long narrow hallways with stairs which makes getting to and from your room a bit of a pain especially with heavy suitcases, Really good location for seeing Buckingham Palace and some of the Parks short walk to tube station as well Quilon restaurant was fantastic as was the room service Staff were friendly and efficient 
183492,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, There is a condo component to this property place that appears to also be a part of this hotel When we arrived we first went into this area and were then directed to the hotel area It was a bit awkward but that was our mistake not anyone s fault I am sure other visitors might make the same mistake so giving folks a heads up , We enjoyed our stay and would consider staying there again It provided us with everything we expected and we were not disappointed with our choice to stay here We had an upgrade to a room with a king sized bed very nice room and finishes Some of the things that stand out for us were 1 Providing us with a power converter when ours failed 2 Lovely bathroom although the door hits the toilet when you walk in 3 The excellent sandwich shop across the street This little cafe served the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had Did not eat at the buffet too expensive and preferred to get out to start touring immediately in the morning 4 Tube was not too far away easy to get around 
183493,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, My room seemed a little tired dated and the lift at the rear of the hotel is tiny and temperamental Noise from the School at the rear was excessive on the Monday morning Try and eat out for breakfast as it s pretty pricey on site , The location is excellent 5 mins from St James Park tube station and the staff service and quality of everything the hotel offers is very high Buckingham Palace is literally at the end of the road too 
183494,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, If you re the kind of traveler who doesn t like to pay for high speed internet access then don t stay here Normal internet speeds are free to access but for anything more heavy duty a pretty hefty fee is involved , The location of this hotel is spectacular 5 minutes from Victoria Station and even fewer from St James Park Station It s also just a short walk from Parliament Square to the east and Sloane Square to the west Seriously great place

183496,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, We were advised we would get 10 off our meal in any of the Taj restaurants Unfortunately it wasn t made clear that the restaurant leading from the foyer I think it is called Bank is not a Taj restaurant so our discount was void The following evening we tried the Taj Indian restaurant Bombay Brasserie and I m afraid the food was dreadful , Bed was very comfortable Appreciated the soft pillows and the dressing gowns Friendly staff We have been twice and will definitely come back again

183499,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The drain was slower than the shower so you ended up standing in your dirty water The lovely gentleman at front desk tried to tell me I was doing it wrong I m a refrigeration technician and know how plumbing works Also a surprise to have a language barrier in England, The location and staff at the check in counter were very helpful and nice 
183500,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Breakfast is too expensive but you have a lot of cheaper cafes next to the hotel, Great Location Optimal for a London visit Next to Hot Spots like Buckingham Palace Tube just a few steps away and even 4 Pubs within a 3 minutes walk

183508,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The hotel staff was not accommodating when it came to our rooms First they couldn t find our reservation so thank goodness I had my reservation confirmation Then when we went to our rooms they were not close to what the picture entailed through the booking com website I believe I paid a lot of money to book the rooms I saw on their website and didn t even get close to it I complained to the hotel desk and basically was told that if I wanted the picture I would have to pay even more Not impressed , The hotel was beautiful which included the courtyard We spent time at the bar and was very pleased Very good location 
183509,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Would prefer cold orange juice and hot coffee at breakfast rather than both being warm , Location was excellent My wife and I like to walk and having a centrally located hotel made this possible to many sites of interest 
183510,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The room seemed very dated and I d expect a little more for my money if I stayed there again The TV was very small and slow reacting controls Which isn t too bad if you re not using it too much Two of the the Windows wouldn t stay open when lifted which was quite annoying but you could argue that the air con compensates for this The charges for the items in the fridge is ridiculous 3 for a can of cola is way over the top and not needed given the price of the rooms , The property was in an ideal location near with Buckingham palace just a 5 minute walk away The staff were friendly nothing over the top and no forced customer service which is a good thing

183522,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Whilst the room we were allocated was small and perfectly laid out it was overlooking a back year and there was an irritating noise coming from some unknown source in the corridor , The staff were extremely helpful particularly the concierge staff We have stayed many times in London and further afield but this was one of the best hotels as far as staff interaction and attention was concerned The rooms were spotless well one has come to expect this but in this case it was exceptional The location was very convenient close to St James Park underground station and Buckingham Palace The restaurants and shops of Victoria Street are within easy walking distance 
183523,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Poor service in the Courtyard for not reserving a table as booked earlier in person consequent delay and confusion before we were eventually seated in the Bistro , Excellent position for our needs Friendly and helpful staff Very pleasant ambiance

183526,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, We really liked everything at the hotel albeit a bit pricey , We had a great experience at St James Court it is a top class hotel in a great location As soon as we arrived the person at reception could not have been more helpful and every time she was on duty she remembered us and asked how we were going or if we needed help Would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and we will certainly stay again next time

183534,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The quality of the food at the bank restaurant just not good enough The zander bar does great cocktails but the music is too loud and doesn t help create a friendly relaxing atmosphere , Very comfy bed Near the tube station 
183535,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The room while spacious could use a bit of updating Also I prepaid the room and when I called the taj was told by the Taj to submit a prepay form on the form it requires you to tick a box selecting the set of room charges I followed directions and elected to add breakfast to the booking com rate i received the invoice thinking i was charged room rate plus breakfast However on checkin they only charged the room rate and did not add on breakfast The person at the front desk refused to acknowkedge the hotels mistake i think their prepay process was at fault because if i was going to be charged the room rate through booking regardless of what i selected why did i have to fillout the prepay form and tick my choice of addons other hotels would have been gracious and comped me the meal for the mixup Here i was told sorry not our fault Esp since on checkin they charged my card an additional 50 pds as a deposit for any prepay room charges it seemed like they added insult to injury , Centrally located 10 minute walk to Buckingham Palace St James Park

183549,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Service at breakfast was not as slick as it should have been staff did not seem to be watching out and had to be asked on a number of occasions to do things such as clear plates and top up coffee we noticed other tables having similar issues On successive days we noticed the serving bowls of food on the buffet were not being promptly replenished Service in the evening though was great , Room comfort food facilities and situation were very good indeed The Doormen were particularly helpful Whilst it was not up to the Taj Hotels we have visited in India neither were the charges 
183550,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, There was nowhere to plug in the kettle near the tea tray only a wall mounted shower inside a bath no hand held shower , The location was a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace and a few old English pubs close by The service was very good and it has a lovely garden area to enjoy an afternoon drink The room had a tea making tray a mini bar and iron and ironing board 
183551,St James Court A Taj Hotel London,No Negative, When booking I requested an early check in which the team were able to accommodate That really helped our day run a lot smoother Hope to be back soon quick check out enabled us to be out and about really quickly rather than waiting in the check out queue 
183552,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Please don t be fooled by the professionally taken bedroom photographs of this hotel To say it is dated is an understatement The reception area and courtyard are well maintained and are very relaxing but go through the foyer and past the doors to the rooms and you see the real hotel If this hotel was anywhere other than 500 yards from Buckingham Palace it would be a 2 star hotel at the very best The expense of staying here certainly does not reflect lack of quality with regard to comfort this hotel has to offer The room we were first given was B B standard so we asked to be given another room The management moved us to a room 5 doors away down the hall which was equally as dated and alot smaller The staff were all excellent with exception to the original receptionist that checked us in No please or thank you and no directions to our room A complaint was made regarding other guests smoking on the 5th floor and the smell coming into our room which was laughed at and answered with well they could be charged an extra 150 All in all I d say the hotel would be 3 or 4 star in somewhere like Spain but in London I m sorry to say there are better hotels for similar money, Great location of hotel
183553,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, There was nothing not to like, Upgraded to the Buckingham 51 all suite building across a beautiful courtyard from the hotel Fabulous included breakfast with both buffet and cooked to order cocktails in the evening and a fabulous concierge staff It was so wonderful we extended for an extra day Have never stayed in this area but a short walk to big Ben and across the river to the Tate modern and the Globe Theatre

183555,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Nothing , Staff was friendly and attentive The location was great with Buckingham Palace down the street The room was a decent size for London with a great bathroom Everything was clean and spic and span Price was good for London too 
183556,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Keep in mind that this is a very old building that was updated As a result they had to work around some structural constraints The square footage was inaccurate from a usable space standpoint because they didn t subtract the thickness of the walls between 2 to 3 feet thick The furniture that they chose for the relatively small rooms was too big for the allotted space The bedroom had a strange table with a bench underneath that was totally unusable A smaller dresser would have been a huge improvement There is also a weird spotlight under the bathroom vanity that is pointed directly at the bed We had to improvise a paper cover over it to allow for a night light that wasn t blinding The towel warmer didn t work There was an awful smell every day in the ground floor elevator lobby , The rooms were cleaned two to three times a day The staff was very friendly and accommodating The dressing area off the bathroom was handy The breakfast that was included was a good touch 
183557,St James Court A Taj Hotel London,No Negative, Frankly apart from the location bank next to Buckingham palace this property is far away from what a Taj Hotel is The upholstery carpets are too old torn at places the rooms are awfully small Since it s a 1500 hospital turned to a hotel it is not an ideal hotel but to make matters worse the restaurant menu needs a lot to look into The breakfast was truly pathetic and minimal like in a typical bread and breakfast hotel Spinach paratha everyday no curries only scrambled eggs and sour to too salty sausages We had a word with the restaurant management but still nothing really changed No idles no dosage nothing And to top it the staffwas too busy with pm visit Moreover due to protests outside we were even not allowed inside by the police until someone from the staff ritesh intervened Overall will not stay here again but for its great location Hope Mr rakesh sarna reads this 
183558,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The only thing I could improve would be to stay longer , Great position for sightseeing on foot Close to the tube Very comfortable bed Great view from the windows over the central courtyard with little street noise Nothing was too much trouble for the staff Relaxing in the evening with a bottle of wine in the Hamptons Bar listening to a talented musician on the piano 
183559,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Rooms a little tired could have done with a lick of paint and a new bathroom , Breakfast served until 11 even in the week and late check out of 12 noon enabled us to have a rare lie in without panicking about missing breakfast and rushing to pack

183564,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Business center could be improved and maybe larger options and choices on breakfast, The staff are very friendly and provided me with great service specially front desk they make you feel welcomed and always go the extra mile to make sure I am happy It s not my first time staying with them and will not be my last the location also is great and near touristic attractions On the other hand the hotel is vintage offering unique experience of staying in a hotel with history
183565,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The breakfast could have more choice Some rooms quiet distance from the lift , Near Parliament and Westminster Abbey great historical building helpfully staff 
183566,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The Location was very good but it is not located near a mini market If groceries are needed the traveler should buy them first and it could be not quite comfortable It is possible to hear the underground station from the rooms no too much but is possible, The room was good location near every single tourist place
183567,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Had a noisy room next to elevator I am sure other rooms were better location Hairdryer at the desk in bedroom with no mirror Room had no view just office buildings , Hotel is beautiful and the staff are excellent Everyone was very friendly and helpful Great location one block from Buckingham Palace

183569,St James Court A Taj Hotel London,No Negative, Booked a 2 night break for us and our friends throughly enjoyed our stay My friends room was very large as was my sons ours was a lot smaller but very comfortable We had booked a royal afternoon tea for when we arrived the staff made us feel very welcome and the food especially the cakes was exactly what we expected from a hotel of this standard We visited a few London pubs on the first night there literally are a fair few of them around each corner probably due to the proximity of the barracks then ended up trying some of the special gins that the cocktail waiters recommended back at our home from home Our breakfast on both mornings were fabulous with plenty of choice inc a taste of India This hotel is literally next door to Buckingham palace The only thing we missed was having a swim after being tourists on the second day they have a sauna steam room but they are seperated into men ladies sides and my friend had a migraine on the Saturday afternoon so while the chaps all had a nice steam room chat together I was on my own in the female facility the only minor negative 
183570,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, There was nothing not to like about this hotel , This hotel is beautiful and the staff is excellent they were so nice and very accommodating The room was so big and comfortable I would have to say that it was one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at I am recommending it to everyone I know It is also close to everything I would love to go back some day

183579,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, One lift was not working during the whole of our stay Waited a long time to get one lift every day and evening Thought a large hotel like that should have been able to fix it quickly Also was an unpleasant smell near lifts daily Not good views from our Junior suite everything else great , Breakfasts were good but would have expected smoked salmon on buffet breakfast as Indian people catered for with specialities Hamton bar good nice at food and very nice staff who could not do enough for you Especially liked the Friday evening pianist and the Jazz quartet providing entertainment on the Saturday evening Rooms very clean and the hotel rooms are very quiet during the night so we were able to get a really good nights sleep for 3 nights Beds very comfortable including the pillows Lovely toiletries in bathroom Enjoyed our stay which was a Ruby wedding occasion Intend to stay again One end of road brings you to Buckingham palace and other end of road is Big Ben and Westminster Abbey

183709,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, This is really a minor quibble but the service in the Bistro restaurant was ever so slightly off The servers seemed a bit off their game when we chose from the a la carte menu rather than the prix fixe and it took a little while to get to the table although we were the only table in the house Otherwise the food was quite good and the service became very attentive Everything else about our stay was pretty much perfect , The location was great a stone s throw from Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey The rooms were very comfortable and actually quite roomy compared to other places we ve stayed in London

183727,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Firstly this is not a complaint as such We had a lovely stay but there were a few little things not befitting of a hotel of this standard a hole in the carpet under the bedside table a protruding piece of the door latch the part attached to the doorframe on the bathroom door which I caught my hip on twice once drawing blood from the scratch it left and the strong smell of fresh paint which encompassed the room throughout our stay These were all minor inconveniences but considering the price we paid and the standard the hotel is aiming for they are issues I was expecting , Staff were fantastic location is amazing and hotel has been refurbished well aside from a few snags 
183728,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, Few staff didn t seem too well interested trained up to scratch few dirty items within the room and I think the facilities within the room are looking a bit tired and require a bit of tlc or updating , Some staff were excellent and went the extra mile to make you feel welcome and the hotel lobby and courtyard areas were very nice

183862,St James Court A Taj Hotel London, The rate on Booking com is a bait and switch As soon as you arrive the front desk staff will begin to badger you about upgrading to a more expensive room They will describe it in ways that make you think you had better upgrade or you will be sorry and said they had very few so I d better take it now The room I booked didnt sound great so I wanted to upgrade but I was really trying to save money and so I said I thought I would be ok in the original room but the front desk staff managers will badger you and badger you until you just want to pay anything to get away from them The entire check in process took 45 minutes This is not an exaggeration THE WORST OF MY LIFE I was tired and began just agreeing with this manager but he would persist and ask you again and again To confirm that you have heard every detail I think it is a device to get you to pay the extra money I m hardly a novice traveller I stay over 100 nights a year in hotels I changed rooms twice due to extreme smoke smell Arrival can be dicey as taxi s don t know where to take you and can drop you off at the TAJ apartments across the courtyard and then you are made to feel like a heel when you turn up and your name is not on the list in that building Free Wifi is a joke so you have to pay for the higher priced wifi if you want to do anything and overall I would say I paid 120 more per night than I bargained for Again Im an expert business traveller and these hucksters are really good at their game , Sumptuous courtyard and first rate hotel sure to impress anyone meeting you room is well appointed with modern fixtures and a perfect shower bathroom set up Plenty of lighting in the room which is not so typical for London and absolute black out curtains for sleeping
