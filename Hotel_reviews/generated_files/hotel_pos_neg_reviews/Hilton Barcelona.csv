277699,Hilton Barcelona,No Negative, Their best asset was the doorman who was a very hard worker and was so helpful The room was very clean and king bed very comfortable Also hotel in lovely area
277700,Hilton Barcelona, We feel the bed could have been a lot more comfortable The cleaning could be better supervised , The place is relaxing and welcoming its our first time to Barcelona and we left with a very good impression We did not know what to expect and you excelled 
277701,Hilton Barcelona, Hilton has always been a brand one can count on As a tourist a more centralized location would have enhanced the visitor experience , The staff was very polite and that they spoke English was a welcome surprise The room was great Very clean quiet and comfortable Breakfast Buffet was excellent Very American 
277702,Hilton Barcelona, No windows in rooms Just glass Have to walk all the way down to the outside of hotel to have a smoke , The bed was sooo comfortable You almost don t want to get out of bed The best bed I ve slept in There are restaurants next door and transport right outside Loads of shops The hotel smells beautiful Staff very helpful and neat layout of the whole hotel Very clean rooms 
277703,Hilton Barcelona, Executive lounge could have been better organised with breakfast during the festive season during my stay i used it seldom but i did not once see warm snacks or unless i have a different vision of what is hot snacks, Hotel was well situated and staff were great
277704,Hilton Barcelona, They burnt candles in the hotel and it was intoxicating A very sickening smell may be to cover the smell in the street which smelt like sewerage , The staff were great
277705,Hilton Barcelona, The housekeeping need to be improved because they didn t clean cups and bar staff , The hotel is ver very good room is big enough and furniture good and it is calm 
277706,Hilton Barcelona, Poor slow free wifi and rubbish coffee out of a machine for breakfast Come on Hilton Barcelona you can do much better with your coffee outside coffee shops were very good , Location and quality of room Strong shower and great gin options in the bar
277707,Hilton Barcelona, The staff was okay but lacked the kindness and warmth one gets at a smaller boutique hotel Also we had 2 rooms but we only received one small complimentary water bottle between both rooms and one of the rooms was short towels and amenities The front desk probably gave us a room that wasn t cleared by housekeeping Normal things for a big hotel Unfortunately we were spoiled by many other boutique businesses on our Spain holiday so the Hilton stood out as only okay Also they refused to input my husband s Hilton number into our reservation They said we should have booked through Hilton I tried to book through Hilton but they were sold out Clean and okay hotel but there are better options in Barcelona unless you re desperate to be near Camp Nou , Rooms are modern and clean The hotel is close to Camp Nou so perfect if you re attending a game Shopping mall down the street with a fantastic gourmet food market Don t believe the reviews telling you it s close to the beach at least a 15 minute taxi ride 
277708,Hilton Barcelona, Have better hotel signage on Avunida Diagonal and a sign on where to enter the property , The front desk personnel were extremely helpful and friendly The hotel is modern and very clean The outside bar dining was great a delicious hamburger and St Moritz beer 
277709,Hilton Barcelona, Everything else not worthy 265 per night Wifi is very slow rooms are tiny and I have bruises from hitting furniture for days now the bathroom is very small and they gave me a shower despite my request for a bathtub beds are not comfortable staff are rude checking and out took very long breakfast is the worst very dull and tasteless staff in the Resturant are not helpful as I asked once for a tea but the waitress just pointed to the coffee machine without bothering to show me how it works although I payed them the whole amount with deposit cash at check in they still charged my card after 5 minutes for the stay which held my money and still not back to my card after 5 days from the stay Although I ordered earlier check in I reached the hotel after 4 pm and my rooms were not ready and I had to wait hours for them also I make them empty the minibar in the rooms at check in but they still include everything in the bill at checkout which took long time to sort it out So in general worst stay ever no more Hilton hotels for me in the future , The location
277710,Hilton Barcelona, Only minor but the shower should have been cleaner in a Hilton Dirt in the corners of a very nice bathroom Totally impersonal hotel, Nice and quiet easy location to pick up all types of public transport
277711,Hilton Barcelona, Basic stuff in the room seem to be missing always got a feeling that the hotel was majorly cutting on cost in everything , Locating was good and the hotel facilities were good
