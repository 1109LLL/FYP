111056,H tel De Buci by MH, Would have liked a slightly bigger fridge to bring in and store waters But not a deal breaker we shifted and made room , The size of room had us feeling like royalty Very spacious for the 3 of us and we did not feel like we were on top of each other Great accommodations in a neighborhood we love from past visits Beds slept well plenty of furnishings towels lotions etc Free wi fi helped us to update on home news mails at the end of each day Sanjay is amazing to work with as always 
111057,H tel De Buci by MH, As expected the rooms were on the small side Regardless they were layed out well and provided enough storage space for your clothing toiletries I really have no criticisms Hotel de Buci and the entire staff deserve an A across the board , We were very happy that we stayed at Hotel de Buci The location is perfect the staff is incredibly helpful polite They will do anything everything to make your trip a pleasure The head concierge Sanjay is a true professional He can do it all from directing you to the best place to exchange currency recommend and make reservations for you at a variety of the finest restaurants book special tours provide you with tickets to all the best museums shows etc etc My wife and I could not have enjoyed ourselves more It was a fantastic vacation and we fell in love with Paris My concerns prior to the trip were completely unfounded We felt extremely safe in Paris The Parisians were for the most part extremely friendly I highly recommend Hotel de Buci and a long trip to Paris 
111058,H tel De Buci by MH,No Negative, The location was amazing and Sanjay and all the staff are super friendly and helpful I look forward to booking this hotel again in the near future 
111059,H tel De Buci by MH, Got robbed on the metro getting to the hotel Put a damper on the trip The hotel may want to push how easy cabbing is instead of metro stations Very expensive metro ride could have been avoided for sure , Loved the decor of the rooms we stayed in Great location and bustling area 
111060,H tel De Buci by MH, Room was very small and cramped They do not have parking You either park on the street which is impossible or use the public parking garage which is where they sent me when we arrived at 11 PM that is over 4 block away Returned to the car the next morning to find the side window smashed in and my small digital camera which was in the console was stolen with all our vacation picture on it , Location was convenient 
111061,H tel De Buci by MH,No Negative, This place stands head and shoulders about all others for the kindness warmth and generous hospitality of its team In particular Sanjay who went to great lengths to ensure my stay was especially wonderful nothing was ever to much trouble The feeling of the hotel can only be described as being amongst friends I returned to this hotel 13 years since I first stays there and wouldn t hesitate to recommend to everyone to stay there We will be back hopefully next year 
111062,H tel De Buci by MH, Entire Hotel is 100 heating OR cooling our room was unbearably hot making it difficult to sleep The hotel could not resolve the issue as the hotel was on HEAT only they also would not accommodate us changing rooms Very frustrating , Brilliant location Cute reception area Lovely decor 
111063,H tel De Buci by MH, Lots of noise from bars and restaurants outside late at night AC system not turned on yet for building so had to sleep in warm room or gets lots of loud noise coming in from outside Otherwise hotel was very good would recommend getting a non street facing room if possible,No Positive
111064,H tel De Buci by MH, Eggs on 2 occasions were cold or scant Wish I had changed to a bathroom with a walk in shower instead of a step in tub a little difficult to safely manage Didn t know that there was a button to lower window metal shade until mid week not enough tissues in bathroom , WiFi is so convenient and computer in the lobby is perfect for confirming airline reservations Breakfast was delicious and a great place to plan one s day 
111065,H tel De Buci by MH, Maintenance issues while we were there , The proximity to everything location was amazing the breakfast was great staff were accommodating friendly Helpful too 
111066,H tel De Buci by MH, The room was fine for one person but for two it would have been very cramped, Location location location Loved that you could sit in the lobby and have a drink while looking out at all the people in the street 
111067,H tel De Buci by MH, Told upon arrival we d been upgraded to the Contemporary room and didn t have the option to stay in the characterful vintage styled room I had chosen and booked despite telling staff we didn t want an upgrade After seeing the Contemporary room which felt like it belonged in a rundown chain hotel had to complain only for staff to say our original room booking was available after all I felt disappointed that our requests weren t responded to until we complained , Excellent breakfast and option to have breakfast in room 
111068,H tel De Buci by MH, Nothing to dislike at all Wonderful and helpful staff , Excellent choices of breakfast food We were able to save alot of time eating at the hotel instead of going out to a restaurant or cafe The hotel is located in an ideal location near St Germain area and a comfortable 25 minute stroll to places like Notre Dame and Musee d Orsay Very close to Metro stops on lines 4 and 8 
111069,H tel De Buci by MH, Lack of gym, The breakfast area and spread is excellent and service top notch The concierge service is the best and actually get bookings that are unavailable Sanjay is the best I have come across

111074,H tel De Buci by MH, The lighting is a little dreary in the breakfast and lounge area but the decor etc is wonderful a real boutique hotel with character , Our room no 52 was just beautiful I was concerned from previous reviews that the rooms would be tiny and facing onto the street would be noisy this was not the case at all Everything was very clean and the staff very helpful and friendly I also loved the L occitane products in the bathroom One of the best aspects of the hotel is the area so many wonderful cafe s restaurants and shops on the doorstep A really wonderful hidden gem of a hotel great value for money and I could not recommend it more 
111075,H tel De Buci by MH,No Negative, How to feel like you are living the Parisian dream stay at Hotel De Buci The delight of entering your room and doing the childlike run and jump onto the luxurious bed in equally luxurious surrounds Great restaurants outside the door and with the French institution that is Paul s just across the road for the mandatory almond croissant Make sure you wander through the surrounding streets there are some real boutique gems 
111076,H tel De Buci by MH, Our room was like a cubby house throughout our travels we have never stayed in such a tiny room There was nowhere to move except lie on the bed nowhere along the walls to put our cases we had to put them in front of cupboards which made it difficult to use the cupboards Bathroom way too tight We understand it was the smallest room in the hotel top floor with slopping ceilings It wasn t the room size shown on the net when we booked If we had been aware of the size we would have requested to have a larger room , The waiter at breakfast was very friendly and efficient Great location
