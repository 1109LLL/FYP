157678,H tel Gustave, TV sucks though everything is in french and the english shows didnt work Wifi is pretty bad because the signal is super weak Also its annoying that you cant check in until 2 But they do hold your bags so you can leave the hotel so thats ok , King bed is big and comfortable The room is a good size because its really only to sleep Bathroom was nice and modern with a big walk in shower Hotel staff was really nice and helpful in showing us good places to go for things like food or entertainment Hotel is newly renovated and in a very nice peaceful and quiet area 10 minute walk from the eiffel tower Went almost every day it was amazing 
157679,H tel Gustave, The room is a little bit small better take one luggage at the same time , The location is awesome you can find tour effiel everywhere from the hotel 2 3mins to the Line 6 train station The room is comfortable and all equipment inside the room are very new 
157680,H tel Gustave,No Negative, Of course the view from our window we are having the room with eiffel tower view plus the hotel are located nearby the mini market In addition the hotel not so far from station make it easier for us to travel anytime Staffs are very friendly
157681,H tel Gustave, There are not much options for food after hours so we opted for the room service We asked the front desk if a particular item had meat in it as we are vegetarian He said there was not When I bit into it there was pork The next morning we explained what happened to the front desk We were told that she had to tell management about the situation and they would contact us We were never contacted This was very disappointing especially since this little jar of food cost 16 euros , Great Property the front desk guy from Venezuela was amazing and made our stay great Walking distance to Eiffel Tower and Brasserie Lola Complimentary Coffee and snacks were great 
157682,H tel Gustave, There was nothing I could fault with the hotel, Location was perfect it was 15 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower and a 3 minute walk to nearest metro station with links to all major sites The room was a good size and air conditioned comfortable and very clean It was modern with good facilities We paid extra for an Eiffel Tower view room and the view was excellent and definitely worth the money The staff were very friendly as well I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Paris 
157683,H tel Gustave, BREAKFAST not good value for money we ate out every morning because of it 16 euros per person for a less than good standard breakfast Not a lot of choice and overall was just a bit disappointing, The coffee was amazing and the garden was cute too The room was lovely and the photos on booking com are exactly what you get Staff were really friendly and take care of their customers Would definitely recommend to others and would definitely stay here again 
157684,H tel Gustave, Saying that it is nearest to Duplieux Metro station, Very clean premises Welcoming and helpful staff with good English Close to Metro and not far to get to anything in Paris 
157685,H tel Gustave, Wi Fi is not good After 11 00pm looks like stop service I ve called the reception and they said everything was ok but I can t use wifi , My room was very clean 
157686,H tel Gustave,No Negative, The service was amazing Nothing was too much trouble for the staff The room was perfect Gorgeous view of the Eiffel Tower Bathroom was the biggest I ve seen in Europe and the shower had a waterfall shower head Room was very spacious I can t say enough good things about this hotel 5 Star 
157687,H tel Gustave, The one thing that is hard to forgive is that upon our arrival non of two staff members present replied to our good evening with any answer and ignored us for 2 minutes I think even being on the phone you could say something like excuse me I will be with you in just a second A bit dissapointing, Comfortable bed cleanliness nice view from the window eiffel tower view room 15 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower Espresso and bottled water available in the room
157688,H tel Gustave, There were no bathrobe and slippers in standart room The towels were not very clean the hair dryer didn t work , New and stylish hotel good located Everething is very close Clean enough 
157689,H tel Gustave, I requested a quiet room yet was placed on the first floor facing the main road At 7 00 am on the sunday morning the guests next door to me made a lot of noise banging their luggage against my door as they left both of our 2 rooms were contained within a tiny hall behind another door for them to get out of the second door they obviously had no room and disturbing me was pretty inevitable even though i was told the rooms were sound proof At 8 30 I was then again awoken as the maid was cleaning the vacated rom and banging her vacuum against the walls as she cleaned I actually ended up asking her to stop As a GENIUS PERK i requested a late checkout The hotel told me this couldn t be confirmed until the day of checkout so i couldn t plan around that at all After being so rudely awoken by my neighbours and then the maid I called reception to ask for my Genius Perk of an extended checkout the 3rd time i had requested that Perk I was told i could have 1 hour extra I thought that was an insult after the events of that morning and certainly wouldn t consider 1 hour a genius perk Its not that I wouldnt stay there again but I felt pretty disappointed in their service and that Booking com tell me I m a valued Genius member yet I see absolutely no benefit at all , Clean pleasant Good location
157690,H tel Gustave, Breakfast was expensive at 16 pppd , Hotel was in an ideal location Close to metro and tourist destinations Amazing bakery directly opposite the hotel All the staff that we met were multilingual and coped with my subpar French amazingly View from room was amazing 
157691,H tel Gustave, The staff Especially who name are JULIO and the new one staff i forgot his name but who have dark skin LUCA or something Julio was impolite and Luca wasn t responsible and slow response The first day before i did check in i was calling to this hotel to ask if i could put 5 big luggages at their luggage store And they said i can So i went to this hotel but when i arrived there the staff said i just could put my luggages only 1 day And i stayed for 4 days Also the room was too small 12 m2 And until late night that guy JULIO still put my luggages in front of the main door He said that he will move to luggage store when he had time even for go to toilet he hadn t time to do that Of course this is wasn t our problem This guy JULIO was so impolite And when we did check out i already asked to one guy dark skin guy i forgot the name but maybe LUCA or something to take my ice gel from the refrigerator of the hotel And that guy went to take but he came back without ice gel Without saying anything then we did payment i was thingking maybe his college would take the ice gel for us And i forgot and also that giy never remind me anymore On the way to the airport I remembered about my ice gel because it was very important for my breastmilk for my baby And i had 5 ice gel and i need to take airplane for 15 hours and without that ice gel was so difficult I called to that hotel and that guy I picked up the phone and i asked to take the ice gel to the airport soon because i had plane in 1 hour but finally the solution from that guy and that hotel sent me an email to give my address and also sent to them some money to delivery that ice gel It was so silly they weren t responsible enough and even they made mistakes but they never confesa and never did service excellence How come Gustave Hotel can be a 4star hotel with this very poor service , Clean room
157692,H tel Gustave, Room wasn t cleaned every day Could have done with more hot food at the breakfast but that s probably an English thing , Hotel decoration is great The location is a short walk to the eiffel tower great for pictures and exploring 
157693,H tel Gustave, Nothing, Excellent clean rooms all with either Nespresso machine or kettle Free drink on arrival Reasonably priced bar with bottled local artisan beer from Gallia 
157694,H tel Gustave, It was in the suburbs so was a good walk away from other places and not many taxis available in the area It was close to the metro but there were a lot of steps and we had an elderly person with us , The rooms were clean and serviceable and did their job 
157695,H tel Gustave, The reception wasn t as clean and crisp as what the photos show The lift is also TINY and quite slow so pack light as you don t want to be doing multiple trips , The view from our room was incredible The bed was very comfortable and the decor was interesting at first but I loved it when I jumped into bed Great idea 
157696,H tel Gustave, my door keep banging if my neighbor gone out closed their door as if someone is going to open my room door , the room is comfy the bathroom is clean
157697,H tel Gustave, No croissants Probably an exception to the rule , Quality room furnishings and bathroom View right out on Eifel Tower Very friendly and helpful staff 
157698,H tel Gustave, I might have considered looking for a location that was more central to the main tourist sites However this area had a more local feel so it s a trade off just be prepared for longer walk and or metro rides 30 40 minutes to the Louvre The street was a little desolate for walking back from a metro station alone at night , Close to residential areas Lots of really good local bakeries cafes and restaurants The staff was really friendly and helpful 
157699,H tel Gustave, The view of eiffel tower doesn t come unless available And we didn t get the room this time So that s a disappointment , The staff were very helpful and friendly The two ladies Ms Lowen and Ms Chloe were genuinely interested in helping us discover Paris and making our stay enjoyable
157700,H tel Gustave, There are a lot of pushy vendors near attractions and children with signature sheets who are very pushy bordering on aggressive visitors should be warned of these , Friendly welcome from the lady on the front desk lovely rooms the only thing I d change is lots of English tea and milk for the room as I think that s a must for British customers but a wonderful hotel and a fantastic city Merci 
157701,H tel Gustave, I liked everything , Everything Staff is awesome rooms are so clean and confortable at its maximun Its very close to Paris eifel tower and to the metro station 
157702,H tel Gustave, Room service is microwavable meals Some of the reception staff don t speak good English Rooms tiny No hair conditioner No gym or swimming pool Slow WiFi, Could see the Eiffel tower from bedroom Staff were very friendly and helpful Rooms were cosy and clean WiFi was free Free laundry service though didn t get a chance to use this 
157703,H tel Gustave, The street is quite dark so I wasn t feeling safe while coming back at night , I liked this hotel Had no problems room was clean and warm Wifi worked well and everyday they had journals in lobby 
157704,H tel Gustave, The room view of the Eiffel was far from what was displayed online and we were disappointed by that Did not justify the price of the room with the view , Location and hotel itself was very lovely clean and well kept We enjoyed the room and the hotel itself 
157705,H tel Gustave, I booked a view with eiffel tower and the room didn t have a view of Eiffel tower and they didn t want to change the room saying that not all rooms are same as pictures,No Positive
157706,H tel Gustave, 1 Pictures are misleading as it indicates rooms with a view to the Eiffel which none have 2 Even though received approval for early check in at 12 I was not given a room until 3 30 pm and that is after requesting a late check out which they denied and after having left and returned at 2 as they indicated that would be the time the room would be ready a day wasted waiting on LAME excuses wait there were none given just that I had no room duh 3 As a genius member I was promised a glass of champagne at our arrival we didn t even get offered a glass of water C est la Vie 4 We were never advised of any of the amenities of the hotel nor that the bottles of water in your room were complimentary we had to find out the next day as they were greeting new arrivals while we were waiting for our shuttle pick up Tres dissapointed , Comfort of the bed and location of walking distance to the Eiffel Tower
157707,H tel Gustave, That we had to leave , Modern clean spacious size room with a view Could watch amazing total view of Eiffel Tower lights glittering from the very comfy bed Bathtoom products replaced daily were lovely pod machine in room great great coffee machine downstairs with selection of lovely specialty teas Staff were lovely air con in room really cold able to manage yourself staff organised tray with kettle teas for the room bottled water in room complimentary daily great location close to Dupleix Metro Love the 15th Travel to Paris a bit this is our new favourite boutique hotel to stay 
157708,H tel Gustave, The hdmi on the television didn t work the shower leaked a little so the bathroom floor was wet some of the time , Gorgeous views friendly staff clean rooms 
157709,H tel Gustave,No Negative, Perfect location right next to two metro stations that stop at most of the main attractions Only 20 minute walk away from the Eiffel tower Good value for money and staff are amazing 
157710,H tel Gustave, Lobby corridores smell not good exteremly slow elevator small rooms, Location view calm staff beds comfy accessible to cafe shops grocery very clean room
157711,H tel Gustave, If water bottles and tea bags can be put in every day in the room it will be great Asking for water every night once you come in was a pain , Bed was great toilets very clean and staff really helpful The location was particularly amazing The Wi Fi was great as well which is unexpected from a hotel of this size 
157712,H tel Gustave,No Negative, Nice little boutique type hotel in good location near the Eiffel Tower Staff were friendly and helpful Rooms were nice and we had a view of the Eiffel Tower 
157713,H tel Gustave, Nothing , Traditional building but thoroughly modern inside Tastefully decorated and well equipped Location meant it was quiet at night but still close enough for all the attractions 
157714,H tel Gustave,No Negative, The room was great and luckily we had the best view possible Deluxe room We didn t have the chance to get breakfast because we would always wake up too late for it But the system of the open bar and write down on the paper what we get is really pleasant 
157715,H tel Gustave, Maybe a little bit expensive for one night but we were there during the European championships, Friendly and very helpful staff very clean and excellent location
157716,H tel Gustave, there was nothing negative about our stay , wonderful view of effiel tower close to subway very helpful and friendly staff can t wait to visit again 
157717,H tel Gustave, Maid should clean at appropriate hours rather than leaving till end of the day when we would return also when we did return she was mid cleaning so she left most of the room Uncleaned 5 day stay and only half cleaned the room once The rooms are also very close together so in the night you could hear people comming and leaving as the doors are big and heavy , The welcome was friendly the staff remembered you as you left and entered the hotel The staff were helpful at arranging transport and advice on attractions The hotels location is great it is close enough to the effiel tower to walk if you want to go for a little but far enough to be away from the crowds 
157718,H tel Gustave, Strange smell in the corridors which weren t as clean as the rest of the hotel , Friendly staff and use of umbrellas it was very wet while we were there 
157719,H tel Gustave, We had a trouble with our ticket and could not get to Paris on schedule We informed staff of this The first guy we spoke to told me he would speak to manager to accommodate us He seemed willing to do so Then at check out the guy on duty refused to honor this Not what we expected at all We had been travelling for the previous 2 weeks and all the hotels we stayed in were customer service oriented and we were determined to return So big surprise in Paris , We like the view of Eiffel tower 
157720,H tel Gustave, Didn t like having to go downstairs for a cup of tea but it was free and I could help myself anytime night or day but no English breakfast tea seemed every type but , Staff were welcoming and very obliging and informative Loved the Eifel Tower view from the room Loved the fridge and shower 
157721,H tel Gustave, 16 for breakfast is excessive , Quiet street three minute walk from nearest restaurants and metro Dupleix Nicely decorated room with generously sized bathroom minus the bath and shower Excellent wi fi signal 
157722,H tel Gustave,No Negative, Was in Paris to attend Roland Garros so for this it was perfectly located The hotel was a great find and had a lovely boutique feel to it Rooms a good size Extremely clean and furnished beautifully 
157723,H tel Gustave, The gap between the two beds pushed together to make our king could be felt but it was so comfy I didn t mind not having to share , Everything The staff were amazing beds comfy room beautiful and in a really good location Very happy
157724,H tel Gustave, There was no full length mirror WiFi connection was hit and miss The bathroom window was covered with a curtain but I could imagine it could be seen into from a neighbour , The powerful shower was excellent The view of the eiffel tower The room overall was very nice The hotel was peaceful The receptionist Vanessa was very helpful The eiffel tower was only minutes away 
157725,H tel Gustave, There s nothing to dislike it s a chic boutique hotel in the heart of the city, Our stay was perfect with fabulous service by Vanessa and all the front desk staff 
157726,H tel Gustave, The fan sound from bathroom could not be turned off but if you close the bathroom door you don t hear much Breakfast was a little small with few choices the first day the scrambled eggs were not so good , Perfect location 5min walking from Dupleix station Hotel was clean and very comfortable Bed was super comfortable Meal can be served in the room with nice food Bathroom with Italian style shower was simple and clean Breakfast yaourt of choice not only from cow milk I liked the ewe yaourt 
157727,H tel Gustave, Useless wifi if you need to do any work or make Skype calls , Clean quiet very comfortable bed great bathroom and rain shower It s in a very residential part of the 15th so there isn t a lot of oh wow Paris around but that s kind of the point of this place I think 
157728,H tel Gustave, Spotty internet in room , Stylish newly refurbished rooms with an abundance of the kind of quality amenities you d expect at high end hotels Incredibly convenient location on safe quiet street in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower Super clean property with comfortable attractive lobby and lounge areas featuring free capuccinno expresso hot chocolate all day and night In addition the Gustave has an OUTSTANDING management and staff of people who truly love helping guest enjoy their experience So glad we found this charming boutique hotel 
157729,H tel Gustave, No restaurant in the hotel but the breakfast and small bar facilities were available the hotel is too small for a restaurant they will order in room service Better to take a short walk to nearby places , Very helpful friendly staff Managed to let me into my room very early helped with booking a car because of the taxi strike All fluent in English I do try to speak French but they were all so good it wasn t necessary
157730,H tel Gustave,No Negative, Great location very friendly and lovely rooms I also like the surrounding areas a great choice of places to eat and very near a metro so simple to navigate Paris 
157731,H tel Gustave, The bottled IPA beer but the lager was OK , The friendliness and flexibility of the management and staff the style and character the high quality of the bedroom and especially the bathroom the comfortable bed the peace and quiet of the hotel the all round we wish to serve you attitude 
157732,H tel Gustave, Rooms a bit small but it s ok No view , Clean Friendly and helpful staff Tea and coffee making facility in room Good location About 5 mins walk to Dupleix metro Great bakery opposite hotel 
157733,H tel Gustave, There was nothing we didn t love about this place , Friendly helpful staff Beautiful clean cozy room Excellent location for sight seeing 10 10
157734,H tel Gustave,No Negative, Very nice newly remodeled rooms We stayed in connecting family rooms Very clean and nice thought out finishes The staff was very helpful and pleasent Beautiful hotel All areas of this hotel were very clean Within walking distance to Effiel tower and many other great sites Canceled Hotel Paris Bruxelles in favor of this one So happy that we did Very good breakfast Extra fee but well worth it Very nice garden terrace area off the dining room for coffee and conversation We will be rebooking this excellent hotel again upon our next visit to Paris I highly recommend booking your stay here 
157735,H tel Gustave, the room elevator the corridors very very small the however i guess all Europe like that , very friendly staff helpful clean rooms and the room cleaning services
157736,H tel Gustave, The room I was staying in was next to the stair cases so the sound of people stomping down the stairs was a bit disturbing But isn t enough reason not to recommend this hotel to anyone The air conditioning was set manually to shut off at a certain time during the night time because of the expected cold winter period Unfortunately it wasn t as cold as predicted so during the night it got a bit warm , The beauty of this hotel was such an eye catcher The Parisian decor was absolutely beautiful the location was ideal 15 minutes from the Eiffel Tour We also took the fat tire tours which was also walking distance from the hotel say about 8 minutes maximum Let s talk about the comfort of the room it is small and compacted with all the necessities and clean The shower was my favorite part of this trip after biking and long walks around Paris I was looking forward to the rain forest shower which is one of the two options available I would definitely rebook my stay whenever I m visiting Paris again 
157737,H tel Gustave, Holiday always too short P, Great location Tasty and different food everyone will find something Good place to stay and close to everything you would need on Crete
157738,H tel Gustave, maybe a bar where you could have a last drink before heading to bed , Great place staff really helpful and welcoming they also advised me on places where to eat good food and galleries museums to visit my stay could not be more comfortable Hotel open all night Heartbreaking view from my room 
157739,H tel Gustave,No Negative, Hotel location Comfort of the room Hospitality and friendliness The manager Roberto was extremely courteous and helpful and made our stay very nice We just loved it and would definitely stay there again and highly recommend it

157741,H tel Gustave, There was nothing I didn t like , We were greeted by a young lady when we arrived who was extremely friendly and helpful The room was lovely and location was perfect for what we wanted as it was close to the metro restaurants and bars as well as the Eiffel Tower 
157742,H tel Gustave,No Negative, Location great for the metro and of course the Eiffel Tower some local restaurants are good although service pretty mediocre at most of them Hotel is clean comfortable and the staff were all excellent 
157743,H tel Gustave,No Negative, Location is just perfect Lots of Brasseries around Fantastic Eiffel Tower view from the Deluxe room The room was very clean towels were changed daily pleasant staff 
157744,H tel Gustave, I can t think of a thing The room is small but that is the way hotel rooms are in Paris I d MUCH rather have a small clean room than a large dirty one , Close two city blocks ish to the metro Small grocery a few doors down Great staff VERY clean Great value I would stay here again with no hesitations Thank you Hotel Gustave Keep up the good work 
157745,H tel Gustave, Like other Paris hotels the room was quite small with nowhere to put my one carry on suitcase but on the floor in the way of the bed , It was a good value hotel in a convenient area and very clean The staff were also friendly 
157746,H tel Gustave, The corridors wallpaper was a bit gloomy and the headboard was a bit dusty , The room was gorgeous and the exterior of the building was amazing aswell Easy to find directly by public transport and there was a free coffee machine Staff were very nice aswell 
157747,H tel Gustave, Couldn t open little closet without moving desk chair , Their recent renovation is stunning and clever A small room feels huge Lovely staff welcomed all my French cousins who were equally impressed Close to Seine Eiffel Tower Metro 
157748,H tel Gustave, A little loud in the morning with the cleaner and other guests walking up and down the stairs Not much choice of breakfast Buffett for price , Comfortable and stylish Brilliant wifi access and location 
157749,H tel Gustave, Nothing, Pleasant staff clean room v comfortable beds excellent bathroom good location you can see efile tower from the window near by lots of shops and restaurants
157750,H tel Gustave, none, Location was great 5 minutes from Dupleix Metro Station If you like to walk a lot the Eiffel Tower is just a few blocks away Our room was the cheapest but it had a view of Eiffel as well Close to convenience stores restos brasseries 
157751,H tel Gustave,No Negative, Excellent location can see the whole effiel tower from the room we had Can tell the hotel had just been re furnished everything is new and spotless our room was made everyday and topped up with free tea coffee biscuits and water I d defiantly recommend anyone to stay here

157753,H tel Gustave, The rooms are not that big and the cost seems to be on the higher side , It s quite close to the Eiffel Tower and the nearest metro station is very close by as well It s not a very big hotel but you get good facilities As the hotel is newly renovated the rooms are nice and clean Front office staff is very good and helpful 
157754,H tel Gustave, Quite soul less No facilities apart from a coffee machine in reception Tiny room No drawers or storage space, Beautiful furnishings Comfort of bed and bedding Good location
157755,H tel Gustave, Front deak Staff were not friendly at all We had to change our rooms twice before getting our two rooms we had booked Staff in the restaurant and cleaning staff were incredibily friendly and helpful , Location was great
157756,H tel Gustave, Cleaning was very hit and miss bin not always emptied coffee and tea bags not always replenished Wash basin was blocked air con not working , Such a comfortable bed fridge very useful
157757,H tel Gustave, No milk was provided with the tea and coffee but this was not really a problem with the shops nearby opening late , We liked the friendly efficient staff and the general atmosphere It was close to grocery shops so we could buy fruit and wine and bread easily and milk for our complimentary coffee and tea Within easy reach of the metro 
157758,H tel Gustave,No Negative, Very friendly staff a great room comfy beds nice bathroom and toiletries and an amazing location with a metro station very nearby and loads of nice resturaunts and shops 
157759,H tel Gustave,No Negative, The whole atmosphere is one more attributable to a top Paris hotel and yet the charm is that it is so personal and Virginie the manager so welcoming and helpful This will now become my Paris home 
157760,H tel Gustave, bathroom was very smelly in the first day and the staff used way too much air fresher to fix it which apparently didnt really help , location is perfect very close to Eiffel tower and metro station 
157761,H tel Gustave, When we got there we were told we could pay later the next day while we were in the room they cut off our cards so they didnt work for the doors When we got downstairs we were told it was because we had to pay on check in then the day we checked out we we asked how we would be paying After we had already paid The guy had to check again and apologised However I found that a tad distasteful , The hotel was very modern and clean tastefully furnished It was also very close to the metro and lots of restaurants and stores nearby Gabrielle at the Front Desk was really nice and friendly They also helped us print out our tour tickets and stored our luggage and called a taxi for us to the airport 
157762,H tel Gustave, At first night two young Arab neighbours were singing Arabic song in their room and we stayed up until morning as a result Somebody had boiled milk in the electric kettle , The place was quit enough to sleep well not at first night of course The location was good
