36043,Marlin Waterloo, Small detail but no bin in the room that I could fine only a tiny one in the bathroom Also TV wasn t tuned in that s how new this property is , New property great coffee maker in room Fantastic shower 
36044,Marlin Waterloo, Check in process very poor Thick layer of dust under bed Impossible to reach reception from Handy device Room phone did not work, Nespresso Location Good wifi
36045,Marlin Waterloo, A nicer room with bath , Rather run of the mill no bath which we d asked for room overlooking train tracks wouldn t go there again
36046,Marlin Waterloo, A bath tub would have been nice but that is a very small quibble Puzzled to be asked for photo ID never happened to me before in the UK so I refused I suggest this policy is reviewed ,No Positive
36047,Marlin Waterloo, Woken by drilling in adjacent room somewhere at 7 20am staff stopped it the moment we reported it but not ideal Shame they don t do breakfast but no big deal at there are facilities nearby such as restaurants and supermarkets, Modern comfortable helpful staff nice bar handy for South Bank The area is in a state of flux through redevelopment but this hotel is a good new addition and offers good value for a family stay near some big attractions London Eye National Theatre etc 
36048,Marlin Waterloo, We couldn t get the room phone to connect to reception so when I needed to call I used my mobile There was no leaflets booklets with tourist information about the local area e g Imperial War Museum There was some kind of mobile phone provided in the room but no clear instructions on how it worked, The kitchen in the room was excellent with everything you could need provided even up yo a tea towel The entire room was comfy as was the bed it was large and so comfy and the blackout curtains meant we slept so well There was also no noise from outside at all The sofa and seating area were great too 
36049,Marlin Waterloo,No Negative, The Marlin Hotel is new and very clean It has a guest laundry facility which was very helpful The rooms have full kitchens which is great for families They accommodated us nicely with a sofa bed for the kids 
36050,Marlin Waterloo, Charge taken immediately on my Credit Card when I booked a free cancellation Promised a room with a view did not get it Bit out of order as a non refundable booking would have been cheaper , Perfect location for South Bank London attractions Very clean comfortable room All staff very helpful
36051,Marlin Waterloo, Leftover curry smell inside the room and the lobby on our floor stays for two nights until we left and it s still there There was a mix up of the room booked and we nearly couldn t get the room we booked but fortunately the staff was able to sort it out in the end , The bed is comfortable and it is close by the underground
36052,Marlin Waterloo, I think the rooms are absolutely fine comfortable and high end fittings and fixtures it just lacks a bit of cosyness What about a few magazines also no instructions in the room I didn t work out the iphone supplied that was available perhaps that could be explained , It s a shame there isn t a facility to have croissants or basic breakfast items Nice to have a kitchen but you need to go out and get the items which you might not want to do before dressing etc Perhaps a delivery could be arranged and people pre order In some hotels I go to rather than have a dining room they have a nice basket of goodies delivered to the room
36053,Marlin Waterloo, Free handheld was faulty and they didn t offer a replacement Our rooms floor had women s hair everyday regardless of how many times I complained Overall staff attude was kinda rude the only few who helped me out of potty I tipped , Room layout was nice Decor was sharp Price was very nice
36054,Marlin Waterloo, I didn t like the way the staff treated us No manager around They didn t have the same type room that we had paid for so they downgraded our room and never paid us back the difference in the price They kept changing our room The maids just made up the beds and never cleaned the room or never left any supplies of towel bath supplies or tea and coffee in the room , Location
36055,Marlin Waterloo, they had a towels problem so we received a single towel at 23 30 we ve been told that it s only a one time problem They forgot our wake up call , excellent rooms and location
36056,Marlin Waterloo, There was no hot water in the bathroom sink There was a laundry snafu and we didn t have fresh bath towels for the last 2 3 days of our stay Also the guest computers with attached printers didn t have ink So if I needed anything printed and I did I had to forward link or email to the property s business email account and have an employee print it out for me Defeats the purpose of having 2 guest printers Just buy more ink cartridges , Everything was new since it is a relatively new hotel I also loved the kitchenette 
36057,Marlin Waterloo, the shower area because it can wet outside while you re showering No soap and shampoo plates , Very new hotel and I like kitchen area and equipment 
36058,Marlin Waterloo, My credit card was charged even though I chose the Pay later booking When I contacted the hotel I was told that they don t have a Pay later option I really wanted to stay at this hotel for the price and the location so I cancelled my original booking and rebooked and the non refundable rate When I inquired about the refund of the original booking I was told that since I chose the non refundable rate I would not be getting a refund A call to booking com and I was finally issued a refund I understand that it is a new hotel so I give them the benefit of the doubt I would still recommend this hotel and will stay next time I visit , Great location I wish our stay was longer Staff was very accommodating with storing luggage before after check out Walking distance from all the sites 
36059,Marlin Waterloo,No Negative, The room was very comfortable and modern The AC was great which was nice as it was very hot in London that weekend The hotel was also very conveniently located across the street from an underground station Great place to stay
36060,Marlin Waterloo, Gave the impression we were lucky to have a room Didn t have the twin we requested Didn t tell us when they had the room redone as a twin despite it being almost midnight Both room keys stopped working the first day Didn t leave enough towels after cleanin Were still cleaning at 5 00 pm Didn t have us in the right room when we checked out ,No Positive
36061,Marlin Waterloo, No concierge very junior staff Amenities in the room were sparse For example one tiny bar of soap given for a whole week waters not replenished no body lotion no wash clothes , The hotel is new very comtemporary Nice bar 
36062,Marlin Waterloo, Because the hotel is new they have a few things to improve , This place doesn t have a kitchen so every meal service is off the question but just across the street is a COSTA coffe The hotel is new and the staff is really nice 
36063,Marlin Waterloo, Check in was very slow, Location bus stop in front of hotel subway station few blocks away very comfortable beds very quiet although stayed on the 2nd floor everything very clean good size fast elevators 
36064,Marlin Waterloo, Arrived at the hotel and all the staff seemed overwhelmed and disorganised Had a list of crossed out room numbers to go by and took 30mins to sort out a room we had booked a month ago With staff going to check which rooms were free which made the start of the trip quite stressful However once the room was sorted we loved it and the facilities were great A bit cosy with the sofa bed pulled out but was manageable ,No Positive
36065,Marlin Waterloo, Staff , Reception did not appear to have our reservation details and kept us waiting an hour while they tried to find rooms Rooms had been pre paid 
36066,Marlin Waterloo, We were asked to move rooms twice it was difdicult as we were staying with a toddler and elderly parents they took extra money from us and it took so many calls to get our money back the staff at reception dint know many things,No Positive
36067,Marlin Waterloo, Chaotic management Staff were shifting all the time When problems occured they said they would solve it in a friendly way but the problems were never solved The door lock was dead the first day we arrived so we had to change a room We lost something in that room and they promised to get it to us Everyday we had to explain the situation to a new staff and the lost stuff never came back to us Finally a supervisor promised to mail the stuff to us in Newcastle but ten days has passed and still nothing All in all I don t recommend this place considering its high price and unpleasant service , The room was spacious The location was good 
36068,Marlin Waterloo, This hotel opened recently and still has some kinks to work out Check in took a long time The air conditioning in our room did not work if the lights were off even if the room key was in the power switch Our room was not serviced until 4pm and then towels and toilets were not replaced and I had to call down to reception , Staff were very friendly and helpful Excellent location 10 min from Westminster 20 min from Trafalgar Square Covent Garden Borough Market etc 
36069,Marlin Waterloo,No Negative, New building with new furnishings Very central location close to all attraction sites Spacious and clean rooms with full kitchen facility Welcoming staff Good price compared to hotels with similar qualification 
36070,Marlin Waterloo, Check in was pathetically slow Arriving at 3pm the hotel couldn t tell me if booking com or the hotel had already taken payment So I had to pay again hopefully not twice but still need to check my credit card statement Eventually zzzz checked in but they still didn t have a room available for me so I had to leave my bag and come back Check out was also very slow Seems like staff and booking system need more training examination etc , The room was spacious good air con very clean and very comfy bed 
36071,Marlin Waterloo, The quilts on the beds were really big for a single bed younger children would struggle with the weight Also no instructions with the cooking appliances which I figured out but perhaps a non English person might struggle, Loved the heated bathroom mirror Loved the facilities have a fridge etc 
36072,Marlin Waterloo, Nothing, We were amongst the hundreds of people who were left stranded in London when British Airways cancelled all their flights out of Heathrow due to power outage Prices of hotels in London skyrocketed and were fully booked everywhere We were so lucky to be able to book Marlin Waterloo We arrived at the hotel at 10 pm to find a snaking queue of similarly affected people waiting to check in The manager personally came out to greet all the tired guests and assured us that everyone who has a confirmed booking will have a room He also explained that that was only the second day that the hotel commenced operation and that they had not been expecting such an overwhelming number of guests To top off the excellent customer service the F B manager went round with chilled wine and orange juice for all the guests who were waiting to check in The room itself was extremely clean with comfortable beds Room amenities were excellent We did not use the other facilities in the hotel but the gym looked pretty decent The hotel is located about 2 mins from Lambeth North subway station and a easy 7 mins walk to Waterloo station I would most definitely stay at Marlin Waterloo again and would highly recommend it Despite being a new hotel the staff were very well trained warm and very genuine 
36073,Marlin Waterloo,No Negative, The rooms were very comfortable great to have a little kitchen with even a little dishwasher The bed was fantastic The distance to the city and public transport is fantastic 
36074,Marlin Waterloo, Where to start First room I was given had been used Wet towel on bed water on floor in bathroom handsoap opened and left lying about Spoke to front desk who said they will upgrade my room and to leave my luggage as they will move it New room didn t seem any different to first one And had been delivered someone else s bags not mine Having to explain that those bags need putting back to the room they came from And mine bringing to me I felt it was hard to relax with such big mistakes being made and promises of upgrades not followed through At check out I found the guy rude and unhelpful I have left the hotel relieved i was only staying 1 night but totally unrelaxed and tired I would unlikely willingly stay in this place again Photos show the wet towel found on my bed and the bathroom wet and used at my check in , The location is handy for Westminster or Waterloo 
36075,Marlin Waterloo, The immediate area is undergoing significant regeneration work but once in the hotel you would not know this , The staff are very friendly and professional This a modern well presented hotel The room was very clean comfortable and spacious Across the road from a tube station and 10 minutes walk from the Palace of Westminster 
36076,Marlin Waterloo, I chose a room which was described as with kitchenette and was offered an upgrade to a room without a kitchenette However it had a kettle tea and coffee facilities , Comfortable room with views All mod cons including air conditioning on 9th floor Pleasant helpful staff bed was comfortable Free storage of our luggage for the day
36077,Marlin Waterloo, Nothing to be honest waiting for Pret A Manger to open it s the door next to the hotel entrance to have some breakfast options , Marlin Hotel is very new opened less than a month ago the facilities and the room is very very lean and the staff were very helpful internet speed is high and very stable the area is very nice 10 mins walk to waterloo station and Lamberth station just across the hotel
36078,Marlin Waterloo, I hate those mingy serves of milk , I had a presentation to do at the House of Lords on Wed 24 6 2017 It was fantastic to be so close I had an attack of nerves on the Tues afternoon It was so good to take a walk past Westminster Palace and on to the bookstore Waterstones in Trafalgar Square I bought a book relevant to the House of Lords seminar I was attending 
36079,Marlin Waterloo, The staff was unprofessional rude lacked knowledge unauthorized people were entering the guests rooms , The hotel was new very clean with a great location right by the city center 
36080,Marlin Waterloo, The room was originally booked for 4 people two which were arriving a little later in the evening and the 3rd person who decided to join on the day of travel was allowed access to our room without presenting identification or prove of relation to the person who booked the room Although we knew the person was going to be joining us I was a little taken back how she was allowed access to the room without presenting any official documents , The facilities of the Marlin were brilliant The staff were very helpful and friendly Great location for tourists Definitely come back to this hotel
