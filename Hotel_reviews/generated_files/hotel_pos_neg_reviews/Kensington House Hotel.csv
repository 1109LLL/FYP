53487,Kensington House Hotel, No AC but overhead fan made July night comfortable No mini bar but water in room and full bar downstairs Breakfast available , Lovely clean boutique hotel Friendly staff great bed and linens very important to me and a good shower Interesting room with bay windows Terrific location walk 2 blocks to Kensington Gardens 
53488,Kensington House Hotel, The bathroom was a little on the dark side, The hotel was in an excellent location Very helpful staff Good continental breakfast Very comfortable bed and pillows and room was spacious enough for a couple of nights with only hand luggage 
53489,Kensington House Hotel, The blinds in our room allowed light to come in during the early hours of the morning so we woke early The heated towel rail was coming away from the wall in the bathroom and it looked as though it could do with a bit of modernisation and painting The bedroom itself was small and slightly odd shaped being on the corner of the building , Good location for visiting the Albert Hall for an evening Proms concert The staff after welcoming and helpful We were able to check in early and have access to our room Breakfast was ok but nothing special We were able to leave our bags for a couple of hours after check out and before leaving for home 
53490,Kensington House Hotel, Limited options at breakfast , The room was nice and quiet with a little private balcony ideal for morning coffee Bed was very comfortable bathroom was a little compact but the shower was fantastic 
53491,Kensington House Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is in an excellent position for Hyde Park the surrounding shops and the tube stations Staff were very friendly and the room was comfortable and just what we needed for a short stay 
53492,Kensington House Hotel, Unfortunately the week we stayed here was the hottest June week for more than 40 years With the hotel not being air conditioned and the ceiling fan in our room not working properly it was extremely uncomfortable in the room It didn t help that when we left the room in the morning we left the blinds down and the windows shut to keep out the heat but always returned to find that the cleaning staff had pulled up all the blinds and opened the windows somehow thinking that the very hot wind would cool the room , The location of the hotel and the size of the room was great especially at the cost of the room However the bad timing for us with the very hot weather won t stop us from returning to this hotel in future 
53493,Kensington House Hotel, Nothing I would happily return , The staff were very friendly and helpful Mike made us feel very welcome on check in We had booked for breakfast included yet we were offered continental This was a very good standard but felt a little disappointed so I spoke with the manager and he was very helpful and looked into it and agreed that we could have a full breakfast So the following morning I did and it was lovely The hotel was on a quiet road so a great nights sleep The location was ideal for Hyde Park and the nearest tub about 10 min walk 
53494,Kensington House Hotel, Lift was broken so had to carry our luggage up and down 4 flights of stairs The bathroom was very small, The location was excellent for our needs and the breakfast was great
53495,Kensington House Hotel, Bathroom was poor and dated No pictures of them on the website for a reason it seems No way to have the fan running without all lights on too , Comfortable bed very helpful and friendly staff small but good quality breakfast spread 
53496,Kensington House Hotel,No Negative, Staff were all very friendly and helpful during our stay room was nice and the bed was very comfy It was a great location to stay as we were going to the concert in Hyde Park which was only a short walk away 
53497,Kensington House Hotel, The toilet in our room was very noisy think it was a saniflo or something other than that the room was very nice We reported this when we checked out so i expect it will be sorted the bed was ok but not amazing but very nice quality bedding, location excellent room was beautifully designed and appointed with everything you would need for a short break The staff were very helpful one particular guy who seemed to do everything for portering to serving breakfast was very helpful I like the welcome drink I thought that was a nice touch I liked the Elemis toiletries in the room that was a nice surprise to find this
53498,Kensington House Hotel, Small attic room and we are both tall Also thought would be having a cooked breakfast included , The clean room and helpful staff and hotel location And helpfulness when said couldn t have your feather pillows as allergic 
53499,Kensington House Hotel, The room seemed on the small side despite being given a free upgrade Breakfast was fairly basic but you were free to help yourself to extra portions , The bed was very comfortable and spacious which allowed me to go to sleep quickly We also had a balcony which was great as the weather was quite humid 
53500,Kensington House Hotel, Getting access to the wi fi Had to ring reception then waited for someone to bring a slip of paper with the username and password I m used to just selecting the hotel wi fi and logging on Also the shower was over the bath but there was no shower curtain so we had to hold a towel to prevent flooding the bathroom floor , Bed very comfortable room was clean nice quality toiletries 
53501,Kensington House Hotel, Light switches were confusing had trouble getting light to work in bathroom without fan going Managed it in end Also bathroom tap needed attention was very fragile Needed fixing , Loved the fan and air conditioning Very comfortable bed Excellent continental breakfast 
53502,Kensington House Hotel, The room I booked a superior room with a sofa as a birthday surprise for my partner we were given a very small room with no sofa and only one small tub chair The breakfast When we arrived I was informed that a continental breakfast was included in the rate although it didn t stipulate this when I made the booking We were expecting a full English breakfast which is what you would expect when it states breakfast included When I queried the difference between what I had booked and what we were given the staff member on duty far from apologising started arguing with me To make matters worse on our second night despite requesting non feather bedding on the booking the pillows which had been foam on the first night had been changed to feather , To be honest I liked nothing about our stay it was a mediocre hotel passing itself off as five star It was more like a hostel The hallways and staircase had all the appearance of something better than it was 
53503,Kensington House Hotel, The toilet flush needed special handling to get it to flush properly , The welcome drink was a good touch The location is just across from the park so we can walk in nice surroundings to Oxford St Bayswater 
53504,Kensington House Hotel, Breakfast wasn t that nice bread seemed a little stale But a fair selection of continental Breakfast items , Comfortable bed Friendly staff Great location 
53505,Kensington House Hotel, No air con in the room just a ceiling fan but with this on the blinds and shutters banged against the window The Lift is very small , The buffet breakfast was OK The location is lovely a great part of London 
53506,Kensington House Hotel, There is a bar in the hotel but no one there actually knows how to make any kind of cocktail , Staff was courteous and friendly Location of the property was great safe area with metro nearby 
53507,Kensington House Hotel,No Negative, The staff were friendly and very helpful The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable had a good nights sleep Great location 5 minutes from the tube station only a 10 minute walk to the Royal Albert Hall 2 minutes to Kensington Palace and 15 20 minutes walk to the Victoria and Albert Museum 
53508,Kensington House Hotel, At breakfast we needed to ask for juice glasses and plates it seems odd that they don t have a big enough supply for the number of guests they can accommodate On our first morning the cleaner was vacuuming the front hall while we ate in the adjacent bar I would think that this job could wait until the most of the guest have left for the day They need to provide more and more easily accessible electrical sockets so that guests can charge their devices easily , The hotel is very well placed for the Albert Hall Kensington Palace the Design Museum and other attractions in the area You can spend at least a day in the area without having to catch a tube or bus And when you have seen everything in the area it is not far to the West End by tube It is on a street sufficiently away from the main road so that it is quiet The complimentary welcome drink was a nice touch The room was spotless 
53509,Kensington House Hotel, Mould in the shower tatty shower curtain tatty behind the bar tiny lift poor service at breakfast , Free drink and nibbles in the bar Nice fluffy towels 
53510,Kensington House Hotel, The room had been painted so both myself and my husband woke up with banging headaches from the fumes Definately not worth the money and a superior room too Very disappointing, The guy who checked us in Mike was helpful and professional
53511,Kensington House Hotel, We asked for the full English breakfast which eventually arrived after about 20 minutes and it was stone cold dreadfull The menu said smoked bacon and tomatoes and it turned out to be green bacon and baked beans It was inedible so we had to go elsewhere for breakfast The room was tiny and the shower was so weak I seriously considered whether it was usable or not , The exotic fruit salad was fine
53512,Kensington House Hotel, Room 109 has foil on window and located by dumpsters We reserved a superior double with couch in pictures on website but had normal double without couch , The first room 109 on the ground floor had foil on the windows bc it was above the staff entrance and the dumpsters On day two we asked to be moved and the reception was very accommodating Room on 1st floor was fine with lovely windows and view 
53513,Kensington House Hotel,No Negative, Happy and helpful staff the location is great for Museums and art galleries and the number 9 bus takes you to the West End A great three days in London 
53514,Kensington House Hotel, The toilet smelled and they tried to hide by spraying loads of air freshener which was really annoying The room was tiny and the elevator didn t always work , The room was clean tidy so was the hotel The staff were really helpful welcoming 
53515,Kensington House Hotel, For the price for one night absolutely nothing , I had the Sunday rate which made it extra value for money in London The hotel could npt be better placed next to Albert Hall and Kensington shoping It is very well appointed Modern and unfussy I was upgraded to double which was smallish for two I was on my own about same size as a balcony double on a cruise ship and perfectly comfortable A lift to all floors For the price they gave me bottled water for two and tea and coffee facilities plus breakfast very unexpected additions for the Capital at the rate charged 
53516,Kensington House Hotel, Not to have the heating fully on when it was a warm day as it was stifling We did turn it off and put the fan on Replenish empty tissue boxes and the drinking water , The staff were very friendly and very efficient and helpful it was very clean and tidy The breakfast was a buffet and was nice as a buffet can be The bed was very comfortable and it was a great location just off Kensington High street and Kensington Palace The tube was 5 minute walk away which was a bonus for day trips around London 
53517,Kensington House Hotel, We had booked a deluxe double room but not sure that s what we were given as it seemed a bit on the small side Never the less as it was only for one night it was fine and was clean and comfortable with all the usual extras which was good , Excellent location for the Royal Albert Hall where we were attending a concert and also for a morning stroll around Kensington Gardens after an enjoyable breakfast the next day 
53518,Kensington House Hotel, Breakfast was very poor for a 4 hotel Bathroom was quite clean but I missed slippers bathrobe hairdryer and iron were included , The hotel was calm and had a great location 
53519,Kensington House Hotel, BREAKFAST ALL THE STAFF WERE RUNNING AROUND LIKE HEADLESS CHICKENS AND SERVICE WAS SLOW NO ONE SEEMED TO BE IN CHARGE THE ROLLS WERE FROZEN THE FRUIT JUICE WAS NOT LABELLED AND IT WAS NOT MADE CLEAR THAT THE COOKED BREAKFAST AS IT WAS WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE COST HOWEVER THE CHARGES WERE DROPPED , COMFY BED
53520,Kensington House Hotel, Bar breakfast staff was a bit miserable and made the atmosphere less relaxing Single room lacked ambience quite spartan Comfy but basic , Reception staff friendly and welcoming Clean hotel fairly quiet and near Hyde park Great to be able to open window and have real air rather than air con 
53521,Kensington House Hotel, Just one suggestion Why don t you adopt the T Lodge idea of changing towels less often ie Every other day instead of daily I never change towels on a daily basis at home Save the planet and cut your laundry costs , Welcoming friendly staff Comfortable value for money hotel in a good position 
53522,Kensington House Hotel, Towels were changed every day whether you wanted to or not no choice to save water and energy like most other hotels have The elevator is small and the stairs are steep this is part of the building s charm though In another city the price would be expensive for what is offered but this being London it was acceptable , The location is great in one of the best parts of London Kensington The hotel is on a quiet side street but really close to High Street Kensington and Kensington Gardens The room was small but comfortable and the continental breakfast was decent Plus all the staff were very friendly 
53523,Kensington House Hotel, Looking online at the hotel i thought it was going to be a lot bigger For the price i would of expected slightly more Room was very dusty for what we thought was a high end hotel Towel heater was constantly on making the room rather warm We did use the fan and open windows to cool this Also breakfast was very basic , Bed very comfortable Welcome drinks very much appreciated Ideal distance for intended use 
53524,Kensington House Hotel, The bed felt lumpy The carpet was stained The entry card to the room did not work on either occasion I needed it The lift did not work in the evening ,No Positive
53525,Kensington House Hotel, the only thing that let the room down for me was the towel rail above the bath wasn t very secure , The bed was very comfy the room was clean and tidy the hot water was HOT which was nice a wonderful choice of food for breakfast full continental was available to choose from along with a selection fresh bread and pastries great location within walking distance of Museums Restaurants and The Royal Albert Hall
53526,Kensington House Hotel, Tiger bar area was cold and music in the evening would have been more inviting Toilet in room 301 seriously noisy probably woke up the whole hotel , Great location within easy walking to tube shops restaurants about 15mins walk from Natural History Museum Great view of Hyde Park from our room Perfect location for The Netherlands Embasdy Friendly helpful staff 
53527,Kensington House Hotel, Much too expensive for what it was The bed was pretty solid and the duvet was so thin we were cold all night The room was much smaller than expected considering how much we paid and we could hear everything other guests were doing including brushing their teeth The breakfast was very average and no one seemed to be paying attention when we tried to get coffee , The pillows were really comfortable and the staff were lovely We got a free drink each on arrival and the room had everything we needed 
53528,Kensington House Hotel, The room was perhaps too small A tiny tea table was inside the wardrope which is far from being convenient for the guest Just a little spoon as cutlery The room was very dark Some people fail to understand that a hotel room is not just a place to sleep it s a temporary home Sometimes you need to work at the table which otherwise has no sense in that microscopic room in a country where it s dark after 4 PM A proper light bulb shouldn t spend tens of pounds in electricity , Excellent location High Street Kensington You wouldn t normally expect to find anything in this area for that price Staff friendly room tidy provided a EU GB power adapter upon request 
53529,Kensington House Hotel, The room was extremely small for what was supposed to be a superior room Breakfast was limited and basic even for a continental breakfast Wi Fi didn t seem to work , Location
53530,Kensington House Hotel, some of the staff did not understand English when we were asking for help and the breakfast could have had a little bit more of a variety, excellent location for us right near shops and restaurants not far from oxford street and easy to get to the rooms were lovely and very cosy and homely
53531,Kensington House Hotel, The bathroom toiletries had not been restocked properly we had no conditioner provided on our first day but they stocked it ready for our second , The hotel location was fantastic a very short walk to the shops restaurants underground and bus stations Very close to Hyde Park The staff at the hotel were all friendly and very helpful The room was a small but not cramped and the bed was very comfy 
53532,Kensington House Hotel, I found it hard to connect to the wifi and I only found one socket in the room to charge my devices , Staff is helpful and the room is very comfortable Location is great 
53533,Kensington House Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly staff The hotel is clean and quiet and while my room was small it was more effectively laid out than some larger rooms I stayed in this trip 
53534,Kensington House Hotel, Rooms could do with a renovation but are clean, The location of this hotel was perfect for to get to the royal albert hall the staff were friendly and helpful
53535,Kensington House Hotel, An extra bed cover would have been great as it was extremely cold, Breakfast was lovely no rush nice relaxed I sat reading the paper as the staff cleaned around me they didn t ask me to leave which was lovely 
53536,Kensington House Hotel, Breakfast choice was very limited for me personally but I think it would be fine if you like cereal toast and or pastries , Very friendly staff and comfortable bed Easy to find and great access to local shops bars and restaurants 
53537,Kensington House Hotel,No Negative, The room was spacious clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable we have slept on other than our own The staff were very helpful and friendly We will definitely stay here again 
53538,Kensington House Hotel, The first room we were given Room 201 was cramped especially for the price had a disappointing shower fixture and a malfunctioning heater that wouldn t shut down even after supposedly being fixed by the staff so our first night was miserable However when we informed Reception in the morning we were quickly moved to a nicer room Room 209 with a good heater good shower and a useful love seat Wish they had a mini fridge to hold our wine and snacks Next time we might look for a few more amenities for the price especially in winter , The second room we were given Room 209 the attentiveness of the staff the location not far off the Kensington High Street below Hyde Park There are no frills but the beds are comfortable the linens of good quality the wifi very good and the hotel is clean and mostly quiet Breakfast satisfactory 
53539,Kensington House Hotel, Staff not very friendly Check in staff very grumpy and unenthusiastic Bedroom temperature was way too hot even with fan going Choice of drink in Tiger Bar bad we were offered a free drink incl cocktail but no cocktails available at bar , The bedroom and bathroom were comfortable for a one night stay Hotel generally clean Great location for visiting the Royal Albert Hall 
53540,Kensington House Hotel, Very dark with only two small lamps unless you had the closet and bathroom doors open and even then so if you need a space to be bright avoid The mattress had a bit of a ridge in it room 111 could do with checking No cooked breakfast so avoid if that s a must for you Steps to the front so check if they ve an accessible route if you need that , Room to move around nice and warm really good shower with different settings Light airy in daytime Bathrobe complimentary small water bottle voucher for a drink in the bar Felt a treat which was what I was looking for Not too far a walk to tube Royal Albert Hall or the museums Kettle was in the drawers which took me a while to find 
53541,Kensington House Hotel,No Negative, Nice quiet room with bottled water and breakfast was good too Very close to royal Albert hall which was perfect for our stay and Hyde park for winter wonderland
53542,Kensington House Hotel, Was disappointed with the hotel to start of with We had expected a lot more for our money being given a supreme double We were given a better room in the end but it was still pretty average , Very nice staff generally average hotel but good location to Hyde Park 
53543,Kensington House Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic hotel that offered a warm welcome and excellent customer service Was given a welcome cocktail on arrival The room was clean with good amenities Even managed to get a late check out on the day Well positioned for Hyde Park restaurants and the tube 
53544,Kensington House Hotel, The breakfast On both occasions I had to ask for croissants They were provided but the plates of food all needed topping up , The situation was excellent and the staff were excellent
53545,Kensington House Hotel, The room was very small and there was no possibility to open the window old system , Breakfast was fine and with quite a choice fresh fruit salad The location is great not far from High Street Kensington but in a small quiet street 
53546,Kensington House Hotel, Let s start with the fact the room was meant to be superior double hate to think what a normal double was like There was damp in the walls cracked plaster the room was heated to near topical temperatures made it really uncomfortable to be in there was no way to hold the windows open till I wedged the welcome booklet under them to keep them open Half the channels on the TV didn t work the cable for the kettle didn t stretch far enough from desk to socket so had to heat a faulty kettle up on the floor which I would think would be against health and safety standards and biscuits included were smashed to pieces The shower was only meant for someone under 4ft tall because the overhang of the roof prevented you from getting underneath it and there was no splash guard which meant the floor would get just about saturated resulting in kneeling in the bath tub trying to wash hair then with someone who s previously had back trouble trying to get up and out again not good Couldn t stay in the room for long and even took my belongings down with me to breakfast so I could leave as soon as I d finished , Breakfast was ok Bed was comfy View from window wasn t the worst That s it 
53547,Kensington House Hotel, The room we had was small too small The breakfast is everything but English and rather minimalistic The WIFI you have to pay for 10 pounds for 3 nights You have a connection but you cannot read your mail , At first sight the hotel is nice beautiful location and nice neighbourhood
53548,Kensington House Hotel, Even the Superior Double was quite small and at least ours had a poorly sound insulated door between the neighbouring room luckily they were pretty quiet Lift was small and seemed to work a bit erratically Quite dim lighting in the room , For our purposes the location was great easy to get to from Victoria Station and right across from Hyde Park Kensington Palace Very quiet location staff was very welcoming and helpful 
53549,Kensington House Hotel, Breakfast buffet not quite as slick as I would expect for a hotel of this quality Several staff on duty but we had to ask for coffee and replenishment of crockery , Quiet hotel both internally and externally Excellent location D cor in good order Complimentary glass of cava was a nice touch Courteous staff 
53550,Kensington House Hotel,No Negative, The staff were friendly and welcoming The extra touch of the welcoming letter and the complimentary drink in the hotel bar were lovely Our room was on the top floor it was small but cosy and clean and the view was quite nice Its a short walk from major attractions such as the Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Gardens There are also some great places to eat on Kensington High Street which is only a short 5 minute or so walk from the hotel I would definitely come back 
53551,Kensington House Hotel, Room and ensure we re both quite small, Very helpful and friendly staff nice cocktail to compliment the evening good location for our visit windows in room made the room feel light and airy
53552,Kensington House Hotel, Wi Fi is very slightly problematic but the reception staff are most helpful over it , Spotlessly clean good decor very friendly staff Quiet at night although so close to busy High St Ken and there was even a glimpse of Kensington gardens from our window Great value for this location 
53553,Kensington House Hotel, Small hotel with limited spaces corridors reception restaurant outdated business facillities Slow internet speed , Very friendly staff Great Location easy access to High Street Public Transport Turist Attractions saving quite a bit on transport Pleasant breakfast Clean rooms with great mattress Elemis bathroom cosmetics Loved it 
53554,Kensington House Hotel, Perhaps a hot breakfast but must say that enjoyed the continental breakfast good ham and cheese yoghurts cereals and fruit Could have had some nuts and seeds to add to the cereal and fruit Very pleasant environment Could also have had a choice of teas in the room with Earl Grey and some herbal teas for example , Toiletries were lovely and d cor looks new and updated and very very clean Very helpful and prompt reception staff 
53555,Kensington House Hotel, It s expensive and the room we were given was small and lacked any view , Very quiet and comfortable and a few minutes walk from the Royal Albert Hall where we wanted to be 
53556,Kensington House Hotel, The bathroom was clean and perfectly adequate but could do with a little updating , The staff were all very happy and extremely helpful The rooms were very comfortable and at a very reasonable price 
53557,Kensington House Hotel, Breakfast was fine but a bit limited if you wanted a hot option , Staff were very friendly and helpful The manager Antonio went out of his way to make us feel welcome 
53558,Kensington House Hotel, There was only one wall socket available in the room Not very handy with two smartphones , The location was perfect The room a little small for a superior room but it had everything we needed Breakfast was simple but good and the staf was very friendly We will come back when we visit London again 
53559,Kensington House Hotel, Breakfast needs some improvement And the bathroom is really old , Perfect location near Kensington gardens and Natural history museum Not far either from Royal Albert Hall so it s perfect if you want to go to a concert Bed was good neighborhood is surprisingly calm
53560,Kensington House Hotel, No complaints or problems more milk and biscuits in our room would have been nice , We booked this hotel to stay over night in London after a concert at the Royal Albert Hall and we re very pleased The hotel was very smart the staff were very polite and our room was very clean and had everything we needed for a good night Our continental breakfast was more than adequate and included in the price we paid and the complimentary beers from the hotel bar were an excellent start to our stay We think we had very good value 
53561,Kensington House Hotel, Single room was rather small , Elemis products in the room and robe added a touch of luxury Very courteous staff and attentive A free glass of Cava was offered in the bar and nibbles was a nice touch 
53562,Kensington House Hotel, Tiny room tiny bed But it s London so I didn t expect much more , Great location staff was very helpful facilities are clean and comfortable Staff was eager to please made arrangements for theater tickets and secured a car for me for my trip to airport 
53563,Kensington House Hotel, Breakfast room very crowded and staff run off their feet Challenging plumbing to the basin in the bathroom , Convenient location and polite friendly staff
53564,Kensington House Hotel, Only a small complaint we were surprised that there wasn t a kettle tea making facilities but then found them on a tray in a draw when we were about to leave , Good location rooms nicely decorated in tasteful neutral colours ceiling fan welcome in the summer heat Extremely friendly staff on arrival Whole food supermarket close by 
53565,Kensington House Hotel, A fan in the bathroom made a big noise so we need to turned it off while using it One of light bulbs from the main light in the room were also broken when we arrived I think it would be better to check all the facilities before the guests arrive in the room We stayed only one night so we didn t want to complain about these minor issues though , The location is fantastic and all the staff members were super kind We stayed only one night but my parents stayed for 4 nights there They also had a fab experience to stay in this hotel I strongly recommend 
53566,Kensington House Hotel,No Negative, Stayed at Kensington House before and the staff and facility s are first rate Rooms are very clean well appointed and of high standard would recommend this hotel 
53567,Kensington House Hotel,No Negative, The staff are all unfailingly polite and helpful The breakfast option is a lovely way to start the day Very happy to have stayed in this hotel once again 
53568,Kensington House Hotel, The staff are not especially friendly or helpful and the hotel is fairly noisy every door opening and closing every footstep every TV is very audible , Nice location decent continental breakfast included Rooms are very small but nicely furnished 
53569,Kensington House Hotel, I couldn t find ANY faults during my stay here , The staff are extra accommodating I was able to check in earlier having previously requested the possibility via a phone call More so everyone was friendly helpful and the hotel had an immaculate condition to it The room was brilliantly laid out stylish and comfortable and the en suite was large enough for the both of us to go about our business 
53570,Kensington House Hotel, Reception staff efficient but not very welcoming , Very convenient location only a few minutes walk from The Royal Albert Hall Clean room and adequate breakfast 
53571,Kensington House Hotel, Room was tiny Not suitable for a couple Breakfast was minimal at best Cold cereal cuissants mixed fruit And even those were not properly replenished Far walk to tube station , Nice neighborhood in London 
53572,Kensington House Hotel, As a single traveller was booked into a single room it was small with only a tiny window but well appointed , the staff were very friendly the complimentary drink and the quality toiletries a nice touch The plentiful help yourself continental breakfast was good and served in the friendly bar area 
53573,Kensington House Hotel, rude staff tiny bath no complimentary tea making tea on the floor no tv chanels no sence of hospitality broken toaster non existent bar staff strange decorator hanging around staff staring out of windows quality of breakfast if this was an upgrade I hate to think what we were originally allocated , location
53574,Kensington House Hotel, Breakfast a little chaotic as everyone seemed to come down at once but was soon sorted out by the staff , Our check in and out was easy The room and bathroom were v clean Ideal situation for the Royal Albert Hall
53575,Kensington House Hotel, It was very warm no AC and we faced west Not enough to space to put things in bathroom Would like walk in shower not tub , Location great Staff friendly Clean and comfortable 
53576,Kensington House Hotel, Maybe a bigger selection of pastries and enough bananas to go round at breakfast Minor point , the fruit selection for breakfast was lovely the bed really comfy Our room was small but perfectly formed and had everything we needed 
53577,Kensington House Hotel, Small issues in room eg lampshades stained , The bed was comfortable good sleep and the room was very clean Staff were so friendly and extremely helpful Good location for Royal Albert Hall Facilities good ironing board hair dryer and robes in the room 
53578,Kensington House Hotel, Breakfast could have been a bit better organised but that is just a small thing the staff being pleasant enough to overcome this , Room and bathroom very clean and comfortable Breakfast was good although busy I went down later thinking it would be quieter but everyone else had the same idea staff were particularly helpful and friendly 
53579,Kensington House Hotel, Parking is a big issue as they advertise parking but its only at restricted times on the road so they could arrange for nearby parking The Window in the room was rotten and next to the shower with no curtain, Location was good for walking into town and getting buses very near to the Albert Hall
53580,Kensington House Hotel, The lift was very small but no other complaints , Excellent location for the Albert Hall plus the comfortable bed and cleanliness of the room The staff were also very helpful and friendly Will stay here again thank you 
53581,Kensington House Hotel, The breakfast could have been fuller The doors are not sound proof which means a great deal of slamming when people are coming and going at night early morning , Lovely quiet location enthusiastic and welcoming staff Lovely bed Small but clean and well appointed rooms Dont expect luxury 
53582,Kensington House Hotel, Extremely small room Not easy to find the switch for bath room In advance introduction during check in may be helpful But the heating system worked very well , Excellent location for easy access to the beautiful kensington garden as well as the tube station 
53583,Kensington House Hotel, First night in tiny room wirh 4 big luggages, Okay breakfast with superb croissant Friendly staff with nice upgrade for bigger room ground floor for the two nights later after first night with husband in tiny little small room 
53584,Kensington House Hotel, The pictures online for this hotel seem deceptive The outside looks nice but the rooms were very small We were given a tiny room 406 on the last floor At our arrival there were two free bottles of water but one was already half used When we took a shower in the evening one towel had makeup stains and dirt It looked like it already had been used The carpets are stained The shower is located inside a bathtub with no curtain to keep the water in The ceiling is slanted in such a way that you were hardly able to use it without touching the wall Located very close to an old window with rotting wood the window and floor got soaked every time we used it We forgot an expensive set of ear phones in our room in one of the drawers We contacted the hotel They indicated that the maintenance staff found nothing Oh well The service at the bar breakfast room is very unprofessional and would benefit from customer service training , Location was right by Hyde Park Since we like to walk it was not a bad location to reach i e Buckingham Palace etc The hotel was in a quiet side street The reception staff was very friendly and helpful on our day of arrival The continental breakfast was ok Coffee was good We liked the pub located very close to the hotel Excellent service and good food 
53585,Kensington House Hotel, Did not feel like a Superior Double Room Linked single bed bases not a double Two normal single mattresses not even linked or zipped together Mattresses not level Duvet type mattress cover gave no support between mattresses About 50 cm between end of bed wall , Quiet location Lift Glimpse of Kensington Gardens Tea making facilities Safe Continental breakfast Decor
53586,Kensington House Hotel, A small point but would have been nice to have had breakfast coffee in a cafetiere , Complimetary glass of prosecco was a nice gesture Bed was very comfortable and no street noise so we slept well Staff were excellent and very welcoming 
53587,Kensington House Hotel, Although not too far the closest underground stop isn t very close either There are a few bus lines running very close by though , Very quiet location nice room with a cosy feeling and a nice touch Stayed in a superior double room 
53588,Kensington House Hotel, If you wanted a bit of a lie in you would struggle plenty of movement about first thing in the morning , Location was good very close to kensington high St tube station and royal Albert hall 
53589,Kensington House Hotel, The room was tiny compared to Booking s pictures I was expecting the place to be a bit more upscale it is a four stars hotel and the breakfast more sophisticated slices of cheap cheese and ham don t cut it for me in result I think that I paid too much for what we got, Comfortable room breakfast was ok the location is a big plus near Knightsbridge plenty of restaurants and shops around the hotel area and well deserved by bus and tube
53590,Kensington House Hotel, The room was tiny even for a single room , The room was warm and clean Housekeeping was prompt and thorough The hotel was situated within walking distance of all of my meetings as well as Hyde Park for a bit of fresh air I felt safe in the surrounding area 
53591,Kensington House Hotel, For the price paid there should be more extensive and comfortable common areas of the hotel Restaurant staff were very friendly and accommodating reception staff were polite but offered only a basic service no offer to be shown to the room to take bags or given maps or information etc , Fantastic location close to all of the sites with a short tube ride but in a quiet street so not disturbed by traffic The building and those surrounding it are in very good condition and in a beautiful architectural location seems a small thing but good to have iron ironing board and tea coffee facilities in the room Room was extremely clean
53592,Kensington House Hotel, Would prefer a shower screen not a curtain , Very comfy bed Good range of things to choose from at the breakfast buffet Quiet location Free upgrade to a double room when I checked in 
53593,Kensington House Hotel, The breakfast at this hotel was the worst we have ever experienced The breakfast staff were very friendly but didn t seem able to refill any of the dismal selection before it had completely finished Nothing hot was served at all and for this price the least we expected were some eggs on our toast Don t expect anything more than cereals fruit and some bland pastries here When we complained to reception he didn t seem bothered at all and we just got an Oh sorry We ended up having to go elsewhere for a decent breakfast which for the price of this hotel was extremely disappointing Luckily we have a sense of humour and the only thing we could do was laugh at how bad it was Unfortunately we probably won t stay here again although the location was great the awful breakfast and poor customer service completely let it down Much better places to stay for this price , The location of this hotel was great close to bars and restaurants at Kensington perfect for the Royal Albert Hall that we were visiting in the evening and Hyde Park Bedroom was basic but clean and comfortable 
53594,Kensington House Hotel, One of the worst breakfast with definitely the worst cappucino I ever had They are better off giving coupons to have your breakfast nearby in any of the breakfast places only minutes away , Great location close to Hyde Park shopping street and underground Standard room has everything it needs iron board tea coffee tv decent shower good bed and very quiet Room service with external delivery is excellent both in timeliness as in taste Best quality of room service I ve had so far in London 
53595,Kensington House Hotel, Spazi comuni un po da rimodernare Troppo caldo e poca luce in camera di sera Common areas a bit to be renewed Too much heat and lacking light in the room in the evening , Camere pulite e curate Staff gentile Rooms clean and tidy Friendly staff
53596,Kensington House Hotel, Room a bit too small , Position close to High Street Kensington and Hyde Park Closest metro 7 minutes walking Room style decoration and cleanliness Good service we had a small problem with the heating and we got immediately another room a very friendly and kind staff member helped us OK breakfast 
53597,Kensington House Hotel, Was disappointed not to have a full English breakfast the next day for the price that we paid for the room , Liked the location and the size and amenities of the room
53598,Kensington House Hotel, room a bit too small esp the ensuite plus full english breakfast should have been part of the inclusive breakfast price, very friendly staff nice quiet location
