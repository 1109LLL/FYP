69489,Egerton House, Darkness in room on checkin I realize this is an wnergy saving measure but my room had very dark brown corduroy bedding and Dark olive walls which made for a poor first impression on a rainy London morning Probably the other small disappointment was the overall furnishing Colour of the room others have been lighter and more welcoming , Attention to detail and helpful friendly staff Understated welcoming without overkill This was a return visit and I will certainly return 
69490,Egerton House, There were absolutely no bad experiences at the Egerton House , The Egerton House was a wonderful respite in London after traveling through the country In contrast to some negative comments about the staff we found all of the staff to be very engaged and very helpful They were extremely helpful in finding a physician for both of us because we both had developed sinus infections while traveling But their service and help went well beyond that Everyone was always courteous and very responsive to all of our requests The location of Egerton House is excellent but yet it is located in a quiet beautiful neighborhood It was like having our own pied de terre in London We will definitely return there on our next London visit
