255339,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The Wifi was none existent in the room and I was 3 doors away from reception I could actually pick up the network from the KFC next door but not the hotel I was in, The location was the main thing Then there was all the amenities around i e shops pubs and restaurants I wanted somewhere close to Hammersmith Apollo
255340,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The rooms are very small even the one to fit 3 people The breakfast is limited and it when busy you might have to wait a bit too long to get more food out , The staff was friendly and helpful and the hotel looks new ish 
255341,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, We picked this hotel as it was very close to the Hammersmith Underground Station However the air conditioning in our room didn t work the entire time we were there It worked in other rooms lobby and common areas At the time London was experiencing unusual heat and humidity The room didn t have any windows exasperating the issue We were going to stay four nights but cut it short to two given the AC issue We complained several times to management and their excuse was they couldn t find a mechanic that works weekends We countered we paid for a room with air conditioning We found a room in another hotel for the other nights and wanted to get a refund from the hotel At first they balked but then processed the refund If not for the AC issue we d give them 5 stars , We got a refund for the nights we canceled given the non functional air conditioning in our room Breakfast was good and room was clean 
255342,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Wi fi is horrible Reaction from the staff was we will fix it but nothing was ever fixed Breakfast is rather economical Like in a 2 stars hotel , Great location Close to the underground I ve got quite a spacious room though my colleagues were not so lucky their rooms were rather small 
255343,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, the room was so small I could touch both walls not for the claustrophobic it was a single room with a double squeezed in the tv did not work and the hotel bar had no white wine at all , the staff were friendly and helpful the room had air conditioning and the shower was great it had a hair dryer with a diffuser and it was very clean 
255344,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The bed was very small and uncomfortable with poor quality pillows No iron in the room either I called reception but no one picked up had to go down and collect the item myself No shower caps either ,No Positive

255346,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Air conditioning didn t work we informed reception 3 times but nothing was done They didn t even come to the room to look at it We then asked for a fan which they did bring along There were stains on the furniture and hair left in the shower We were only there for 1 night so put up with it but won t be returning ,No Positive
255347,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, I booked the hotel again 9 7 2017 my gf was watching tv and a cleaner opens the door unexpected she felt uncomfortable made the whole expierience worse if u pay a deposit it would take 15 days more than half a month to come back, Nothing

255350,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, No fridge in the room A small room with a pretty hard bed A bit expensive for what you get , Hotel is close to shops like Primark and H M The small shopping center is next to it The hotel is also close to the Hammersmith venue for concerts Walking distance Close to subway and busses 
255351,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The photographs make the rooms look big but limited space around the bed There seems to be damp or water ingress in the corner near the window or someone very badly tried to clear a stain Expensive for the size of the room but hey it s London Hammersmith , Staff were helpful friendly First impression was a nice looking place 
255352,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Chemical smell in the room Asked to pay on arrival then owner was not so keen when I asked if I can see the room before paying Small room and felt overpriced but this is London these days , Fully refurbished Very clean Ok breakfast 
255353,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, To call this an executive double is hilarious really It was basically a box room in that you had to climb over the bed to get to the other side and to the bathroom Absolutely minuscule But fair s fair it was clean and comfortable Just unfortunate that my cat suffered mild head trauma when I tried to swing it You live and learn , It was conveniently located for Heathrow 
255354,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The air conditioning was poor The fan in toilet was noisy No fridge in room Could hear the people outside on landing at all times and was noisy at night, It was central to everything

255359,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, NO car parking Had to walk 30 minutes for an on street car parking charged at 3 80 and hour plus 14 a day congestion charge We had a triple room for 170 It was a double bed with a sofa Only 2 pillows for the whole room 1 towel for 3 guests Beds were lumpy and you could feel the springs Warm water bottles Aweful cheap coffee and uht milk , The carpets were nice 
255360,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The lights and electric with the key card kept mucking up so the lights at either side of bed were on all night couldn t switch them off even when taking key card out, Friendly staff nice room decorately nicely even give you bottles of water tea coffee facilities and also lots of stuff in the shower room and they already supply hairdryer so don t have to bring one with you
255361,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, No full English breakfast included in the room rates, Was not impressed with the breakfast had to pay 5 99extra for hot breakfast and can only get scrambled eggs sausage and beans and take 30 mins to cook Very poor 
255362,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The location is ideal for gigs at the Eventim Apollo but it isn t the nicest of areas , The bed was extremely comfy and the blackout curtains were much appreciated 
255363,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Beds too hard but I guess today hotels have to cater for the bigger framed bodies As with any hotel belonging to a chain it s rather non descript , Very god breakfast Central location The small pool on the roof was a bonus 
255364,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Was a little dusty but nothing we couldn t wipe down ourselves before use, Comfy room great location Staff are friendly and the free breakfast is lovely 
255365,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The room was listed as an Executive Single Room but it was EXTREMELY SMALL Telly didn t work so they moved me to another equally small room This one had no windows It did have a skylight to let some light in but no view to the outside Dreadful accommodation , It was close to my office
255366,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Room 130 was very compact and had a skylight as opposed to an outward facing window Felt a bit claustrophobic but absolutely fine for short stay Coffee machine in breakfast area didn t seem to like dispensing hot water for tea water came out murky but staff got me hot water from kitchen so it wasn t a problem , Good location on King Street close to Hammersmith tube with large range of eateries on the door step Efficient check in and plenty of staff on reception Room quirky and contemporary Nice toiletries and good quality shower Comfortable bed My room was on the same floor as Reception and breakfast area which was very convenient 
255367,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, My friend Couldn t get access to room I spoke to staff and the didn t understand I wanted to pay for room to enable access My friend had been traveling since 3 45 am and had to sit until 2 30pmbuntil I arrived poor communication and didn t go over and above to enable this to happen , Bedroom very quiet and comfortable and clean
255368,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, We had a problem with luggage storage Hotel confirmed before our stay that they do have luggage storage facilities but when we got there we were advised we could not leave our bags in storage Reception staff and Hotel manager refused to help us in anyway other than to say we could store our luggage elsewhere and pay for it ouselves We asked the Hotel to pay the cost of offsite luggage storage they flat out refused Customer service by Hotel Manager was appalling We advised Hotel manager that we would have to speak to his head office about the poor service he was providing us his response go ahead We cancelled our future booking at this Hotel and booked into another Hotel 2 minutes down the road for the same cost who were happy to store our luggage for free , Hotel location is only a 5 minute walk to Hammersmith underground station 
255369,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Layout of self service drinks and toast at breakfast was in a corner so awkward when a few people wanted to use at same time , Very convenient for eating out my room was very clean and comfortable The hotel decoration was bright and modern

255371,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Small room with little space for anything no window there is an opening in the ceiling and we were not taught how to handle it upon arrival so we woke up very early in the morning because the room was full of light lift to the upper levels stops after 10 30 PM , Friendly staff good breakfast nice neighborhood
255372,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, I would ve liked a small fridge in the room, Our International Flight arrived earlier than scheduled check in time Amin offered us early check in which was greatly appreciated A wonderful welcome to our holiday in London
255373,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The fire alarm went off at 0230 and All guests had to go outside onto the road while the alarm was going At first they said it was someone smoking on third floor but in the morning said that it was caused by people outside smoking on the fire escape non guests , Very friendly staff
255374,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, There was a fire alarm at 2 30am which meant that we all had to troop out onto the street at the middle of the night However that was not the fault of the hotel but the fault of some stupid guest who was smoking in his her room , Very friendly staff good restaurant and a very comfortable and clean room 
255375,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Fire alarm went off at 3 a m because some idiot was smoking in their room allegedly Apart from the inconvenience there was not enough staff to marshall residents i e there was no staff to guide people to the designated meeting point outside the building No staff were in high vis vests or had mobile comms Hotel need to address this issue Timing was not great as it was 2 days after the Manchester bombing , Hotel has undergone modernisation in most areas Room 225 was compact but very clean with a good sized bathroom Beds were comfortable Aircon is efficient and quiet Bath towels are super soft Staff are very welcoming polite and friendly Free wifi in all areas 
255376,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Member of staff opened the door to our room whilst we were sleeping and disturbed us during the morning, Best location for a hotel we spotted in the area seconds away from underground gateway to all of London
255377,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The size of the room I m 6ft 3 The room literally had a foot of space around the bed And a light 3 feet above the bed which I almost took out twice when standing The bathroom also left a lot to be desired again as I m tall and the sink was SO CLOSE to the toilet doing your business was an art form required of a contortionist I ll be amazed of that sink is still sound as I knocked the pipework 3 times when go to the toilet , It had a bed 
255378,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Room was small internet connection was poor Breakfast could be better , Location close to metro station Shops and pubs around In general room was clean 
255379,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, I didn t like the very small room or the small shower, The hotel was very clean the staff were great the room was extremely small for two people to get around it The bathroom was large with a small shower 
255380,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The room was an awkward shape and quite small so that you had to sidle into the bathroom , The location was great being on the high street and surrounded by shops and close to the train and bus station It was also nice and warm in the freezing London weather And the front desk people were extremely pleasant and helpful 
255381,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, A little noisy from people in the street I should have brought ear plugs However breakfast is more than adiquate in a lovely dining area Thank you ,No Positive

255385,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, We were satisfied, Over all the service location cleaniness and staff were very good Maybe if the Wifi is more powerful to be excessed in the rooms without any problems would be excellent Also maybe some variety in breakfast not always the same would help 
255386,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Breakfast was a little sparse pain au chocolates a bit chewy could do with a little more choice but quite adequate and meant we did not over indulge , Lovey clean modern rooms contempory furnishings all very smart 
255387,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Very Expensive Breakfast limited Staff not flexible to meet my needs Small room Not really a 4 stars hotel could be a 3 or even 2 Over marketed that is why it is full and expensive , location for my need 
255388,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The air conditioning in the room was way too loud we could not sleep and leave it on it would ve been much better to have a room with a window we felt a little stifled in the room and it was a little smaller than I expected otherwise no complaints The staff were very friendly and the location was perfect,No Positive
255389,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, We had a moderate view but it didn t matter the room was very nice clean and TV To be honest we was out most of the time anyway , Location was perfect for Hammersmith Apollo Breakfast was continental and very good and clean

255394,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The room was slightly warm which was perfect for me as i prefer to be warm however some people may find it stuffy Although I m sure the staff could sort the temperature out for you I just think our temperature dial had stopped working , The hotel is honestly a hidden gem The location of the hotel is great with so many different shops etc easily accessible as it s located on a fairly busy high street The TKMaxx is amazing It s a 3 minute walk from the Hammersmith Station Which was around a 20min tube ride from London Euston Our room was located on the 3rd floor with a beautiful sky light The decor of the room was really modern clean and fresh Our bathroom was spotless with a beautiful waterfall shower head The staff are so helpful and very accommodating Their breakfast although lacking hot food you can receive a cooked breakfast on request was pleasant I can t speak highly enough of this hotel We couldn t hear any hussle and bussle from the main road The bed was so comfortable and was freshly made by the house keepers everyday We stayed for 4 nights and it was great The size of the room was fine for us and my boyfriend is 6ft2 We fitted in a double bed perfectly fine so not sure what other people were moaning about The room came with a kettle tea coffee sugar etc There was an LG flat screen TV built into the wall which had Freeview A hair dryer was also given with plenty of room storage available The staff are so lovely if you were to have any problems they would try their best to resolve them Luckily for us we had a pleasant stay here with no problems what so ever If you can ask for a room on the third floor as the sky lights are beautiful and give the room so much natural light to make up for the fact you don t have any other windows I will definitely come back here again definitely a 10 10 Would highly recommend this hotel 
255395,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, We booked room for 3 people 2 adults and 1 child 15yr old with double bed and sofa bed but got double room with the small folding bed that was located right in the middle of the small room and almost touching the floor After long discussion about difference between sofa bed and folding bed at the reception we got offered second single room for our daughter for one night with the promise that we will get proper room for 3 of us on the second night Despite the change of room for second night Room was not appropriate for 3 people it was so small that we barely had room to navigate through the room Pictures on the site that advertise the rooms are not corresponding the reality Money charged are not reflected in the room facility and service The only positive is a location Very disappointed and the trip overall was ruined by the all room booking and movements from one room to another Also it would be good to notified customer that they have to pay full price at the check in and also that hotel will take at the check in 10 deposit for the room equipment ,No Positive

255420,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Not a big issue at all but you can t use the lift after 10 30pm which for us was fine but being on the third floor might have been more difficult for people who struggle with walking The sign in the lift mentioned to contact the staff if needed so I m sure they would remedy the situation either way , The hotel staff were very friendly and the rooms and hallways were spotless Amazing shower rooms are on the small side but for London a great place to be

255426,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, only one very minor thing there were only 2 cups for tea coffee but the room was for 3 people Not an issue at all for us and I m sure the excellent reception staff would have resolved it if it had been raised with them , room was clean and relatively spacious for a 3 adult room Bathroom well stocked and plenty of tea coffee supplies too Breakfast was typical continental breakfast constantly being refilled so plenty to eat and drink Our room was right next to reception but still very quiet 
255427,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, room was very hot during the night and unable to open windows due to traffic noise , very well located and rooms confortable small but big enough Excellent comfy bed Good value for money with reasonable breakfast
255428,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Refused first room a box without windows Second room adequate but very small Thoroughly disappointed when going to bed found a large dangerous piece of broken bed spring sticking up vertically through edge of mattress Clearly it had been in this condition for some time as large hole worn in side of mattress As it was very late decided to report in morning but had to try and avoid throughout night When reported to staff they were apologetic and transferred us to a better room for our second night Disappointed as would have expected better housekeeping from a Best Western Would point out staff very courteous and helpful, Staff very helpful Breakfast adequate

255432,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, My room was smelling of mildew and the bed covers had a very caustic smell I must admit I stayed there but if I had another option I would found another hotel I had a terrible headache in the morning and noted that it left after a time once I was away from the room Reception staff were also very off putting Must admit it did not give a welcoming feeling , Location to some degree
255433,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, 1 rooms were a tad too small but we were only in the room when it was bedtime albeit it would be nice to return to a more spacious room at the end of a long day up to you we hardly notice it tho , 1 the apple pie for breakfast 2 staff were friendly 3 we were fine with breakfast of toast ham and salami and boiled egg with a variety of hot drinks 4 overall experience very nice well done 5 location was great from the station just walk straight for less than 10 mins a lot of shops and pharmacy nearby and clothing outlets nearby good neighborhood 6 rooms were very clean 7 comfy beds

255437,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The double bed was just a double which we found quite cramped The room was also very small , Just a few minutes walk from the Hammersmith Apollo so very conveniemnt for shows Although on a main road and our room overlooked this it was very quiet The continental buffet breakfast had a really good choice of items 
255438,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The room had no end of buttons and switches for lights and skylight blinds but no instructions , Very peaceful for a London Hotel and the shower was wonderful 
255439,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Needs better noise insulation We were in room overlooking side street Noise late in to the night and bins being emptied early in morning , Location Very close to Apollo 
255440,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Free wifi didn t work No facilities in the hotel such as a bar though tea and coffee was provided in the room , We were going to the Apollo and this hotel is 5 mins walk so very convenient also very close tube and buses Bed was comfortable bathroom good breakfast was fine 
255441,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was a short walk to the Apollo there are plenty of high street shops nearby along with bars and restaurants All the staff were very friendly and makes your visit to a strange place more welcoming
255442,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Cleanliness was below what ee expected in that ee found nail clippings on the floor beside the bed We did arrive early but were told our room was just made ready Room was a bit basic and shower was temperamental and seemed to be in its last days , Good position for Hammersmith apollo and underground system Reception staff were friendly too 
255443,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, It was noisy early in the morning Got woken up at 6am because of the street cleaner When we had our breakfast we felt like we where being watched by the reception staff Occasionally staff walked passed almost felt like we where being checked up on inscase we where taking to much , Close to everything bathroom facilities are lovely Nice room 
255444,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Very small room for price paid aircon did not work and not much choice with inclusive breakfast , The staff were friendly very good location and comfy quirky rooms 
255445,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, As a family of 3 the sofa bed was atrocious Ended up trying to sleep on the floor which resulted in us checking out at 5 45am and travelling home very tired , The location of the hotel
255446,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The staff were not particularly friendly You felt like they were doing them a favour quite aloof On arrival they were doing maintenance on the stairs there were no notices apologising or informing guests as to whether to edge past of use the lift At breakfast I asked for soya milk and was given skimmed milk the breakfast area smelt of disinfectant The light shade was broken On arriving back at night there were several homeless or drunk people sat outside by the Kentucky chicken shop who were quite vocal and intimidating when returning late at night They did not seem happy that I had booked through booking com instead of direct , Customer services were helpful prior to arrival at the hotel 
255447,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel,No Negative, Breakfast ok not much choice for anyone that has to be careful with sugar intake Thank god I took my own teabags Overall nice stay hotel staff helpful and friendly 
255448,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, I know we were paying for the location but we were very disappointed with the size of the room I maware we were trying to save a bit of money by having a room for 3 but the third bed was a joke The mattress on the so called sofa bed was so thin I ve seen dog beds with more adequate padding During the 2 minutes silence on remenberance Sunday a staff member felt free to talk his way through it I wanted to say something but could not bring myself to keep calm with his blatant disrespect , The hotel is in a great location for the EventimUK Apollo and this cannot be faulted 
255449,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Reception didnt seem to want to put the heating on in the room which is controlled from reception coldest night of the year my wife was cold and i had to visit reception twice and they said it was on when it wasnt blowing any hot air i think they were tryng to save money not good, Good selection for breakfast
255450,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Mouse in bedroom Thin selection for breakfast with broken coffee machine, Right on the high st Reasonably priced for a reasonably modern hotel

255452,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Road a bit noisy , This time I had a lovely room It was at the front of the hotel so there was quite a bit of noise from the road but not enough to bother me I left a note on day 1 for the batteries to be changed in the third remote and they were I left another on day 2 to say the desk lamp wasn t working and thanks for the batteries and it was fixed when I returned 
255453,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, My room was so small you had to squeeze between the bed and the wall to get to the desk Very odd Above a fast food restaurant , Room was clean and well equipped Continental Breakfast was better than I had expected Staff were helpful I had asked in my booking for a quiet room and they moved me after the room they d allocated me was not quiet

255456,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Bedroom was small Hotel is small in fact with not much room anywhere for relaxing with a book Even getting breakfast was a challenge bumping into people Breakfast choice was OK , Good location relatively close to underground Modern hotel with fabulous showers Staff were pleasant 
255457,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The rooms had broken lights The executive single room was like a cupboard The shower was nearly too small to get in and the bed was just about big enough for a child , Nothing really The location was good but I would never stay there again

255460,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, I didn t like the pillows Only 1 pillow pp and no spare pillows in the room Also didn t enjoy the fire alarm going off at 2am and 6am on our first night there Due to a false alarm , I thought the continental breakfast on offer had great variety for a continental breakfast Nice stylish rooms bathroom very modern and ideal for the stay we required 
255461,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Clearly an issue with the fire alarm It went off twice this trip and also on a previous trip resulting in a disturbed nights sleep , Modern in design and near to the tube station
255462,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The fire alarm went off at 1am and again at 7am there were no fires No milk for breakfast No orange juice at breakfast Staff didn t seem worried about these issues, We have used this hotel before as it s easy to get to and we like the layout of the rooms

255464,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, I ve stayed here 3 times and now know the rooms differ considerably in size and price My first room was lovely reasonable size and a reasonable price Second room I upgraded to the executive room but the only difference seemed to be a chair and aparrently the bedding is a different material This time I paid more but was very disappointingly put in a small room on floor 3 with a vaulted ceiling and very little space The desk was unusable due to all the things on it kettle et al brochures etc but even moving them off left a space too small to use with a laptop You had to dangerously stretch the hairdryer cord to get to a mirror Plus there was some sorted of alarm that beeped every 2 minutes through the night I will stay here again but will try to reserve one of the rooms I had on my first visit , Clean and good location for me
255465,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, We asked reception to book very important taxi but didn t bother to do it Very difficult to find Room so small there was nowhere to put suitcases, Location OK

255470,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, more toilet rolls in bedrooms not good to be left short met another guest in the lift with the same complaint , all staff were attentive and friendly everywhere was absolutely spotless good selection of food for breakfast hotel in good position for wheelchair accessible tube and bus station only 10 minutes walk nice to see a hotel that is well kept not shabby
255471,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The croissants at the breakfast buffet were horribly over baked during my stay The rest of the breakfast buffet is also very limited Some warm choices eggs sausages etc would have been great Although the coffee is quite good I would recommend seeking breakfast elsewhere , The location in Hammersmith is ideal close to plenty of dining locations in the evening and just a 15 minute underground trip to the center of London The rooms were very small but properly equipped and the bed is comfortable Great value for money 
255472,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Noisy heard the tv in main room from our room People coming in at 3am being loud Tiny rooms could just open the door before you hit the bed, Location

255475,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, We were given a room with a broken bed which folded up every time someone sat on it We were initially told that all that could be done for us was to transfer to a Hotel in another area which well after midnight is not what anybody wants to hear In the end one of us had to sleep on the floor for the night However we were offered a free upgrade the following day and a cheap bottle of house wine for our troubles , Staff were pleasant Rooms were small but clean Breakfast was continental but with a good selection of food 
255476,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, the toaster only toasted on one side a very minor thing but an irritation at 7am , The window opened and the air con could be turned off You provided Gluten Bread for my breakfast
255477,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, We arrived for breakfast at 9 45 finishes at 10 30 on the weekend and nobody had checked if the continental breakfast was filled up and the electricity kept tripping Overall though if I need to stop in Hammersmith again I would choose this hotel again , Although the rooms were compact we stopped on the 3rd floor they were comfortable and quiet 
255478,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, I stayed 6 days 2 on my own account 4 part of a conference My first room had no window just a skylight which was a bit claustrophobic OK for 1 night not good for 6 nights After complaining my room was changed , Location is very good close to underground for reaching city centre Premises are clean continental breakfast very adequate 
255479,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The wifi didn t work at all I informed the staff who told me to turn my iPhone off and on again It still didn t work wouldn t let me connect to it as the network had a security issue and upon looking the software had run out in 2015 Also the room was small and I had to move the bed to get in the bathroom , Central location Close to Hammersmith Apollo and tube station No window but had a lovely skylight with electric controls and blackout blind also electric

255488,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Room was small but I guess this is normal in London city center Very noisy noise from the street and from other rooms Poor breakfast selection and not very good quality products would expect more from a 4 hotel Reception is located on the 1st floor and there is a lift on the ground floor which can go directly to the rooms floor So anyone can just come in from the street take the lift and go to the guests floor Even though there is a written message inside the lift that it will only go up to the 1st floor Reception after 10pm I didn t find it very safe In my booking confirmation it was written that payment should be done at the check out Then when I wanted to pay in cash at the check out they say it was not possible and that my credit card was already charged , Centrally located close to many shops restaurants bars bus stops and 2 subway stations

255509,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, very badly designed breakfast area Very small room Large shower head created water feature for the whole bathroom shower heads regularly come loose and sprayed water all over the bathroom The staff reaction led me to believe this happens a lot especially as they had special tools to tighten up the shower head at hand Water temperature in the shower was an issue too, comfortable bed and good location for Hammersmith Apollo Staff were friendly

255511,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Was quite bland Staff okay Breakfast fairly basic Certainly not up to a 4 star standard , Clean and okay for a short stay but if needing a hotel for longer would probably look elsewhere 
255512,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, When we arrived they did not appear to be expecting us It took some time for their computer to link up to booking com and find our reservation Also we indicated a preference for a twin room but were given a double , The location is perfect if visiting the Hammersmith Apollo Very close to the underground The staff were friendly and helpful Good breakfast and not rushed out of the room 
255513,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The ridiculous small rooms available those rooms shoot not be offered Staff was unfriendly and don t care about the experience of the guests , The room was ridiculously small if you clear the desk to work you have less space there was a distance of about 20 inches between the bed the wall with the TV mounted in the middle We were too tired after a day of conference that just carried on and stayed in the room The staff in the morning was so unfriendly and did not care about our stay unpleasant stay at all 
255514,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Breakfast was okay but could have offered more hot options Room felt a little small , Clean 10 minutes walk from Hammersmith tube 15 from Eventim Apollo Range of daytime eateries and shops nearby Free newspaper and well informed staff Hop Poles pub 2 4 1 offer 5 btw tube and hotel really good Traid clothes store across road offers bargains

255524,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Lack of parking We were lucky for one night to get a space in the main road and only needed to pay for a couple of hours but long stay would be a problem Shopping mall car park really close but charges are high , Clean modern rooms and decor Rooms are a bit small but sufficient for a short stay of 1 or 2 nights 
255525,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The light shades was all crushed and broken Was told only continental breakfast was available which I thought there should be a choice of continental or normal English fry up for the money that is charged for the room The air con never worked and the only windows was in the roof didn t fancy leaving it open in case it rained so was a very hot little room with a double and a single bed the 3 of us was sweltering , The staff was very pleasant Not a bad location and the KFC next door was nice lol
255526,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, We booked a delux room for one night The bed and room is ridiculously tiny Trying to walk around the bed there is a wall right up against the front of the bed so there s only about 12 inches distance to the wall so you have to walk sideways to go around to the other side of the bed It s so narrow I stubbed my toe on the center front leg of the bed The hotel doesn t even give you any bar soap or small shampoo conditioner They only have a generic soap dispenser on the wall But the absolute worst part of our experience was the Really bad chemical smell when we entered the room We complained to the manager as soon as we checked in but he just told us there are no other rooms available and didn t even offer to spray air freshener or anything My business partner who I was traveling with was staying in the room next door and he also had the same exact sickly toxic smell in his room We had to keep the window open all night just to be able to breathe The location was good for our business meeting but really bad to catch a taxi , Location was ideal for our business meeting but that s it

255530,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Tiny Windowless room with broken air con and shower I know it s London so a premium but things need to work No window and broken air con is miserable , Great location and breakfast was good 
255531,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Rooms are on the small side Lift doesn t go above 1st year after 10 30 p m , They changed the tiny claustrophobic room for one with a proper window 
255532,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel,No Negative, Good position in Hammersmith so no need to go to West End for shopping as we only had an afternoon free Usual High St shops and near the river for an evening drink Tube station only few minutes easy walk 
255533,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The double room was extremely small we couldn t open the bathroom door properly as it was blocked by the bed situated literally in front of the bathroom door The room was a bit dark with only roof window which we could not keep open because of pigeons walking on the roof Breakfasts were a bit poor and it seemed the staff was not paying too much attention to refilling the food Having a British breakfast option it s London after all would be a great added value , Good location very close to Hammersmith station very clean and well equipped room modern and clean bathroom no noise from the street despite the location in the very busy King Street
255534,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel,No Negative, We couldn t have been happier with our stay here The two men on reception were friendly and really helpful We turned up earlier than check in as we had a wedding to attend and they let us know about a room they had available for early check in they also booked a taxi for us and held our bags the day after so we could go sightseeing We would 100 go back and recommend this hotel as it was so stress free and accommodating Thank you for our lovely stay

255536,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, there is only continental breakfast is available and not english breakfast and this is due to the large numbers of foreign visitors and not enough British National guests , Lovely hotel very clean fantastic location especially if you are going to the Eventim Apollo Staff are very friendly especially Joseph who was very corteaus and friendly and very knowledgeable 
255537,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, afternoon room cleaning should be in the morning , To be honety I love the smell of that place is so fresh compare to the others hotels it s 10 I love stay there the only things would be bette if they could do a bet price for like 4 days for example thank you
255538,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Breakfasts not that great ham was the really cheap type and the packets of cheese tasted of plastic We would have paid extra for a cooked breakfast but this wasn t on offer The first room we were offered had no window and was like a sweat box due to lack of ventilation However the staff were really helpful and we got a room change , good position for tube easy to find friendly staff

255545,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The breakfast could be a little better I hate the arrangement for making toast where you have to stand by the machine feeding your bread in alongside everybody else Also there is a machine for giving coffee drinkers exactly what they want but for us tea drinkers we have to make do with hot water and a tea bag in a cup I realise every hotel seems to have these arrangements but they are still a drawback, The bed is comfortable the bathroom just right there was a problem with my room but I was moved to a new one very quickly The in room safe is a good idea the free bottles of water every day an excellent touch the reception and breakfast area very close to the room I was given my room straightaway when I arrived even though it was early Excellent service

255552,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Far too busy at breakfast had to share a table with another couple damp stain at the side of the bed advised reception and no apology or discount though when I emailed the hotel offered 30 off next our next stay Too many unecessary lights gadgets in the bedroom especially when there s a notice in the bathroom asking for people to re use towels to save the environment slightly contradictory , Location good for Hammersmith Apollo and restaurants varied continental breakfast well equipped rooms nice bathroom Slept well quite peaceful to say it s situated on a busy main road

255562,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, There were no windows in my room and breakfast was ok but nothing spectacular No evening meals were available so it means eating out or bringing food back to the room , This hotel was in a great location only a short walk away from both of Hammersmiths underground stations It is located right within a shopping street

255575,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Location on shopping street meant it was noisy all night Single chair bed had also been made up which took up a lot of the room so I had to fold it away Hair dryer overheated and cut off twice, Staff welcoming and friendly Room clean Great shower
255576,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Room just a little on the small side but this wasn t a problem , Great location very central Comfortable room exceptionally clean with nice furnishings and complementary bottled water Staff friendly Love the stripy carpet 
255577,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The room was cramped and a lot of noise could be heard from the corridor The bed was not as comfy as I would have liked The fire alarm believed to be a test went off in our room early in the morning We were given a selection of milk and sugar for making tea coffee in our room however when we opened one of the milk cartons it was very mouldy but on the whole we got what we paid for , The hotel was very clean and nicely decorated It was easy to find and we were able to park in the multi story car park nearby Most of the staff were very friendly

255580,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, There was a sign that charged for the coffees with breakfast which we though was a bit off as we booked b b but it turns out it had been left out and they removed it just as we had finished and started leaving the restaurant, Fab location for getting to the Apollo abd easy to find
255581,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The room was very cramped and I wouldn t expect to have my head in the sink whilst using the toilet We also wanted a drink in the bar when we got back to the hotel at 10 pm but there was no one around The bed was very hard There was no vending machines selling bottles of drink The view from our window as of a small square courtyard which contained brooms and cleaning equipment , The location and cleanliness of the room
255582,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, A more comfy cosy seating area with softer lighting Drinks after seeing Billy Connolly at the Apollo would have been nicer away from the bright lights of reception and the dining area , Great location staff very helpful and friendly Rooms small but perfectly formed And the shower was the best I ve ever known in a hotel didn t want to get out 
255583,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The room smelt musty was tiny bed small only a double not a king breakfast was not a cooked breakfast alarm was going off in the hallways in the night until we phoned reception No one asked if we enjoyed our stay when we checked out , It was close to the venue we were attending Hammersmith Apollo near to plenty of shops bars restaurants
255584,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, has to be the smallest room we have ever stayed in even the ibis rooms are bigger you can just get a double bed in there and its a struggle to get round and when 2 off you are trying to get ready its impossible the bathroom is about a metre by a metre square and no hot water best we could get was look warm this is not value for money we paid for an execuctive double room dread to think what the basic rooms are like and on check in the receptionist was rude felt like we where disturbing him , location
255585,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Nothing, The young lady on reception was really friendly and made us a cup of tea on arrival even though we were a little early for check in The location is ideal for events at the Eventim Apollo which is only about a ten to fifteen minute walk away Plenty of places to eat near the hotel Friendly staff Very comfortable room with all facilities that you need for a short stay 
255586,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Security anybody could walk in and roam the corridors the reception was set back and the desk was too high for the staff to look who s coming in Other companies have a locked door into the sleeping area , Bottled water was supplied free in the rooms friendly staff very clean with comfortable bed Small room with a skylight window but perfectly OK for the night as it was very good value I asked for gluten free bread and was provided with it It would not have been possible to toast it as the bread would have become contaminated

255590,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Room was a bit small but that was reflected in the price The iron we borrowed was pretty useless , Croissants were absolutely fab Super choice at breakfast En suite was lovely really good shower Bed was comfy TV worked Good selection of hot drinks to make in the room 
255591,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, the room was on the small side very little room at the end of the beds to walk to other side of the room, the staff were very nice breakfast was good plenty of variety decor was nice and colourful the location on the main high street in Hammersmith was excellent
255592,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, When we arrived we were offered a ridiculously small room No 111 we did not accept this and were offered 134 a much better room still small but not ridiculous The double bed is only just a double bed If your a large person you might struggle Parking needs to be factored into the cost at 30 00 for 24Hrs in the local shopping centre which is a short walk away but involves walking through an extremely unsavory concrete nightmare housing estate , Location is ok ideal for Hammersmith Apollo should you be going to a show Showers are possible the best we have ever experienced in a hotel room 
255593,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The room we had didn t have a window , Not far from the tube train and bus station Lovely continental breakfast a lot to choose from Very clean and modern 
255594,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Nothing that I didn t like , Booked as going to Eventim Appollo Hotel 5 minutes walk from the venue Hotel clean beds comfy Breakfast included so all in all a winner

255600,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location for a show at the Hammersmith Apollo very close to Hammersmith Tube station and in amongst some very nice pubs and restaurants Incredibly clean and comfortable Very good value for money I would definitely stay again 
255601,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The room was extremely small for a double I have been to hotel rooms with a larger bathroom than the entire room here The bed according to the staff a standard double was too small for 2 persons to sleep comfortably , the place was clean the room had everything needed Coffie was good for English standards
255602,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, One member of staff was particularly rude When we phoned to ask for directions he was very unhelpful and actually put the phone down on us This was not a good start to our overnight stay ,No Positive
255603,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The ignorant man on reception ignoring me for nearly 2 minutes while he flicked through Facebook on his phone he knew I was stood there as I tapped my card on the desk more than twice before he decided to acknowledge me Great shame as the hotel overall was excellent and a great price , Great location for the Apollo easy to get to from Kings Cross and a short walk from Hammersmith Tube Station
255604,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Room was tiny and only had a skylight extremely hot when we arrived , Excellent location very clean good variety for breakfast Excellent value for money
255605,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, This is probably just about a staff doing his job very seriously but I found one guy standing and watching people as they put every bit of breakfast on their plate it felt uncomfortable However on my first stay at this hotel before that didn t happen so it could just be one occasion , Nice hotel and good service Very clean and also good value for money for its location Highly recommended 
255606,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, only one thing pillows too soft not to a hotel standard, Staff were very helpful place was very close to everything hotel was most comfortable delight to stay
255607,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, breakfast wasn t great overcooked pastries dreadful coffee and faulty machinery , staff were fantastic helpful and friendly room spotlessly clean
255608,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Couple of stains on carpet No window in room to open for fresh air natural light from skylight and aircon works fine Breakfast disappointing as toaster no good and coffee machine broke Staff were on hand serving coffee so that fine I like toast done both sides though , Clean functional great shower and close to Hammersmith Apollo Good tele and digital safe is nice touch

255610,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, My room was good 134 My friends were a bit small but perfect for one night, Room ready early bonus Very clean and lovely staff Great breakfast
255611,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, pokey little rooms no air con shower either hot or freezing Unfriendly staff and poor organisation of breakfast, stylish modern ideal location for shops bars train station restaurants
255612,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The executive room was a little cramped but clean and comfy I think it was executive due to the fact that you could plug your laptop in Parking would have been extortionate even for London 30 for 24 hours but we parked at Westfield 9 50 for 24 hours then tubed it from Shepherds bush market 2 stops 5mins walk from Hammersmith tube station , the location was excellent for Hammersmith Apollo The shower was awesome v powerful There were a few pubs within easy reach and plenty of restaurants Breakfast was lovely Plenty to chose from Price was good value
255613,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Rooms were very small No issue for one night but if had been staying longer would have been a little disappointed the room was about the same size of the bed But the beds were very small not sure they are even a full double , Location and continental breakfast were excellent 
255614,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, We were given a room that backed on to the bar restaurant area where The TV was on loud until silly o clock and sounded as if it was in our room , We went to the Hammersmith Apollo to see Billy Connelly which was only a 6 minute walk away The Station was only 4minutes away 
255615,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, First night given tiny room with five inches between end of bed and wall Complained but no other rooms available room was far too hot all night and same problem when given larger room on third floor for our second night Bed sheets drenched by morning as sweated profusely both nights and poor ventilation even when windows open won t ever stay again and pursuing a complaint with best western Don t recommend , Good location few mins walk from Hammersmith station
255616,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, None , The location is good About 10 mins walk from Hammersmith Station There s a supermarket right across the hotel and plenty of shopping and eateries alongside Staff are friendly too Wifi is good and love how the bathroom floor is heated 
255617,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Very small double rooms Certainly two people could not live properly in this room No space for luggage No fridge in the room for a 4 star hotel is a bit too much for my criteria , The breakfast was not bad It s location ideally close to the underground and shopping malls Clean rooms and good staff 
255618,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The room was really small We had 2 big luggages which couldn t go through the area beyond the bed and they had to be placed right outside the toilet which obstructed the walkway The room we stayed in had no toiletries like toothbrush and other stuff like bedroom slippers so if you need them you have to request from housekeeping , Bed was really comfortable I slept very well during my 4 nights there Breakfast was a very simple spread but good enough Room was clean 
255619,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Rooms were on the small side but to be expected from a boutique style hotel There was a large flight of stairs leading from the entrance to the reception on the first floor of the building which could be difficult to negotiate if you were a less able person Continental breakfast was average , This is a boutique style hotel which is in a good location for catching the tube into central London Price wise it was competitive compared to hotels of a similar ilk closer to central London Rooms were well laid out considering the space available and the shower room was well fitted to a high standard and clean 
255620,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Very very cramped and hot in the room Asked for a double but they put us in a triple and had to have a travel cot in the room as well but the room was to small for a triple in anycase No window either Had the temperature down as low as it would go 17 but we were sweating all night One person on reception during check in and check out, Excellent location and as far as continental breakfasts go it was good
255621,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, I was upgraded from a single to a double room but the double room was very small and was basically a double mattress on two single bed frames There wasnt enough room to swing a cat I m not a very big person but had to walk sideways past the bed to get to the bathroom , The bed was comfortable bathroom was good air conditioning also helpful Was upgraded from a single to double room
255622,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Walls very thin King Street a bit noisy Room rather small for a couple , Close to Hammersmith tube and bus stations Ok for one night stay but not much more 
255623,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Though the floors in the hallway had carpet there were a few noises of people during the night, Staff was very friendly Hotel was in a great location and 5 min walk from the tube 
255624,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The hotel was outstanding The call centre staff at booking com were appalling , The staff in the hotel went above and beyond the call of duty for all of us We were so impressed and will definitely be back 
255625,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Wifi didn t work well for my mobile and tablet, Easy to find close to major locations cheap and cheerful Ideal for staying overnight after going to the Apollo 
255626,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Half way though the stay the lights broke All of them stopped working Phoned reception who sent someone who clearly had no idea how to fix them Wasn t offered a change of room Reception phoned saying we were late checking out even though I had been told a later time plus having to shower in the dark Received no apology, Good location
255627,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Only bad thing is the pillows were not to comfy but that s just being picky it was great stay, Breakfast was nice and included Excellent location and nice place to stay Room was lovely modern and clean
255628,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The lift wasn t working Terrible especially for my parents age and they were on the top floor The rooms where very hot too at some point The wifi is also very weak, The convenience This hotel is near to hammersmith station and is on the high street 
255629,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, One of the rooms had no window Only a sky light Nowhere to park the car for unloading cases We had to go round the block three times , Very conveniently situated Staff very helpful lively comfy beds and very hood bathroom facilities 
255630,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel,No Negative, Rooms clean but compact Nicely furnished with all facilities Had trouble logging onto the wifi Staff helpful Lovely continental breakfast lots to choose from even fussy eaters
255631,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Room on small side but that s typical of London Had disabled access room so prob bigger than average, Great that breakfast was included reasonable selection of food regularly topped up
255632,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Long time since we found a standard double bed We re not really double bed sized any more , Really handy for underground and concert venue Plenty of nice pubs within walking distance for food Buffet breakfast was excellent and kept topped up right throughout breakfast time with fresh items 
255633,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Some of the rooms are too small as are the bathrooms but VERY well equipped We were in room 225 radiator in bathroom did not work and was dripping , Location modern hotel with everything you need but not huge quaint 
255634,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, We didn t have a view because there were no windows in the room then we discovered the window in the celing Lovely looking up at the stars , The hotel is in a good location 5 minutes from the tube Plenty of places to eat and a good shopping centre on the door step The continental breakfast was excellent Would definitely recommend this hotel 
255635,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, The room didn t have a window but then it was dark anyway so it wasn t really a problem , The hotel position suited us We needed a room for three adults with an extra bed not a cot which it had 
255636,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Only a continental breakfrast No hot food which I didn t realise before booking Standard room was tiny I had to walk sideways to get from one side of the bed to the next , Location
255637,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, We wanted to stay at the nearby Novotel which despite booking ages ago was full We could only get double rooms and these were very small Not as good a 4 star site more like a b b,No Positive
255638,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Staff were shocking The room was tiny and the heating was set to full It was like a sauna and the room was too hot and uncomfortable to sleep in Ruined my trip, The breakfast was good
255639,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Could be more friendly May be it is because the receptionists are not British themselves Their English is appalling I had to repeat myself rephrasing sentences Too expensive for small rooms, Breakfast was good Close to tube station
255640,Best Western Plus Seraphine Hammersmith Hotel, Bed small and hard Only allowed one pillow each , The breakfast was adequate but continental The staff were fine a little abrupt and rude but there was a language barrier The location was perfect for the Apollo Told we were not allowed more than one pillow each Overall happy
