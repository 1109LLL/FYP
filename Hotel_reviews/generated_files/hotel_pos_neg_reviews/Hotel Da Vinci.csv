488409,Hotel Da Vinci, The lighting in the room is so low brilliant to prevent glare but not good for us girls that like to do our make up in natural lighting The restaurant was the only place we could use on our first night as we arrived so late from Florence and we were quite far from other places and for a simple salad for 2 people we paid almost 40 Euros Felt like it was catered to Americans did not feel European or Italian at all sadly , The hotel is massive looks a bit like Austin Powers decorated it as it is bright purple centred in what looks like a council estate and empty buildings The rooms are huge and has good shower facilities but no bath maybe just our room The breakfast is massive but does not cater to vegans as they suggest on the website which was disappointing Most of the staff were lovely but there were one or two that treated other customers quite rudely could be a valid reason for this 
488410,Hotel Da Vinci, The Breakfast was very average and the guy that checked us in was not friendly But he was when we checked out , The room was a big size its a Very big hotel The breakfast room was crowded and the food was of average quality In the breakfast room When attempting to make a cup of tea the water was not clean But when we pointed this out a lovely employee gave us a teapot with hot water to make tea she then checked the machine and said that it needed a clean It was summer time and the aircon didn t work very well But it was not too uncomfortable The hotel is Very easy access to the airport and city centre via train which was very handy Overall the stay was good but personally i would not stay again as i prefer a good breakfast but it was a good budget hotel in a good location and it was a very nice looking place
488411,Hotel Da Vinci, No comment Everything was very good , Was a clean place The apartment was very comfortable with lift The personal staff was friendly Very good price The breakfast was amazing very good The area was beutiful 
488412,Hotel Da Vinci, The location is not a nice neighborhood at all The view from the window was a creepy abandoned building and no window covering in the bathroom Not walking distance to anything at all Must give credit to the web photographer because the photos look nothing like reality The shelving inside the room was slanted and coming off the wall and there were dead bugs splattered on the bedroom wall If we would have been booked for more than 1 night we would have switched hotels Not sure how this hotel scored such a high star rating on Booking com ,No Positive
488413,Hotel Da Vinci, Close to bed and window three spider s webs not from yesterday Everything else in the room was really clean , Near autostrada free private parking good breakfast 
488414,Hotel Da Vinci, Beds very firm bar area was far too small for the size of hotel and very poorly ran Breakfast was good value but chaotic , Modern rooms and secure free parking 
488415,Hotel Da Vinci, THE LOCATION VERY FARE FROM THE CENTER I RECOMMEND TO THE HOTEL TO MAKE A BUS TRANSPORTATION TO THE CENTER EVERY HOUR AND MAKE A PRICE FOR IT AS A ADDITIONAL, The room very good and the shower nice The air conditioner very nice also Breakfast great and fresh
488416,Hotel Da Vinci, First Most guests appear only to stay one night when travelling to and from Italy Therefore there is a constant coming and going of guests from morning till late night As the hotel is quite large this causes some noise and also some waiting time in the morning when trying to have breakfast or to check out In addition we had quite loud neighbours which obviously had to scream and shout from time to time and whose television I could hear Plus someone repeatedly made very loud noises down the floor until 1 am until his neighbour obviously had enough and stopped the guy by shouting loudly at him Second As already mentioned the hotel is quite large so don t expect a cosy breakfast On the contrary the large breakfast hall was packed with people The quality of the food was less than average we would say There was lots of sweets and cakes but less fresh and healthy stuff Also the presentation of the food was not well done Third The building appears to be one of three buildings which stand in a kind of park The middle one was well renovated and forms now the hotel The other two buildings flank the hotel left and right Those are old unrenovated and decaying buildings of the same height as the hotel which reminded me of old parking houses The buildings have nothing to do with the hotel but are still a very disturbing sight , Very helpful and friendly staff Nice real beds in our three bed room for children and not just a thin metal frame which seem to collapse any time the child moves Breakfast was included in the price Big parking area outside the hotel Modern and stylish hotel and room interior Subway station within 15 min walking distance train station right next to hotel 
488417,Hotel Da Vinci, Dirty hotel especially in the breakfast almost all the tables chairs spoons were dirty and covered with other foods also at the time of reservations and the reception woman was very rude she asked me to pay 60 Euro because I booked a room for four adults with one double bed and two sapareted bed and my family are two adults and three baby the youngest was two years old and the receptionist told me you should pay for the small baby I don t know how I can book another room only for my two years baby also the way she talk to me was too much bad I asked her a question she didn t answered only she looked to me in very rude way she make my day bad and I will never come to this hotel anymore I heat it,No Positive
488418,Hotel Da Vinci, There was no cattle in the room The breakfast was okay but the area is quite small to accommodate all visitors in the morning and it was quite crowded , It was our second visit to this hotel and we stayed there for 2 days The room was quite big and clean The staff was helpful There was a big free parking place which is very convenient if you travel by car 
488419,Hotel Da Vinci, This is a big hotel Looks like modified apartment block with the same style corridors The breakfast restaurant is horrible Looks like an all inclusive cheap beach hotel with the corresponding food selection , Very friendly and helpful people Easy access to the motorway hence the many on route tourists Rooms very large and comfortable The in house restaurant is very good with a traditional Italian selection All in all a good hotel to stay for business purposes 
488420,Hotel Da Vinci, Room view was bad Breakfast was limited to some egges bred and chees The hotel is very old and located in very scary locations Underground station is 1 km away from hotel Grantee deposited was taken and not retained The room pictures was different and very old Some of the room lights were broken , The price was good
488421,Hotel Da Vinci, We were given a room designed for handicapped people some of special inventory were a bit cumbersome for example toilet Room was not as clean as first time bathroom Otherwise as good as previous stay , Staff is very good Breakfast is great good choice Wifi worked better than in previous stay week ago 
488422,Hotel Da Vinci, All okay nothing which would be worth mentioning, Room Design was nice liked it a lot Staff was very nice all interactions perfect Nice reception staff all smooth and easy Breakfast is buffet style the room can be very crowded as it s a kinda small room for the big guest capacity of the hotel The breakfast itself was okay plenty of choice quality okay The room itself is really nice design wise we felt well in there We had a minibar with all necessary things for a short stay like our 2 nights All in all we liked it
488423,Hotel Da Vinci, The signage to the hotel The problem is the one way street there is no indication that the hotel is just up the road and that one has to go around the one way circuit A sign there would be extremely helpful , The hotel is very well located 5 mins from the autoroute 20 mins walk to the metro For the price there isn t really anything to complain about The room was large good selection of food for breakfast We didn t eat in the restaurant so cannot comment on that Excellent value for money 
488424,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Good for car arrival departure as it is very close to motorway Only 10 minutes walk to Metrostation giving you easy access to central Milan Friendly staff and very good breakfast buffet 
488425,Hotel Da Vinci, Stuck in the elevator for 15 min No apology no compensation Just a laughing technician No Problem , Very nice hotel very generous spacing etc nice buffet
488426,Hotel Da Vinci, Internet and WIFI connection, The hotel and the staff were perfect The only bad thing was they internet WIFI was that bad u could not even open a simple page And most of the time was disconnected But in general all were good 
488427,Hotel Da Vinci, I wish there was a fitness room or a gym and an entertainment bar with pool snooker Not many vegetables salads in the morning buffet No or very few I dodn t find any TV stations in english All in all a great hotel with an amazing price Great value for money , The room had excellent bed and pillows Also the curtains were very thick so it was perfectly dark in the night Not sure about soundproofing because I always sleep with ear plugs but the minibar was very quiet Good selection of cakes in the morning for people who like sweets 
488428,Hotel Da Vinci, The hotel is located a little far from the centre It is at least 15 minutes walk to the subway and it is the last stop on the line So be prepared if you go into town that you will not be back soon Also there is nothing around the hotel so you will need to take the 15 minute walk in any case , The room was very good and big large good bed nice large bathroom Breakfast was a big buffet and was very good it was also included in the price Parking is outside the Hotel on the backside but just near the Hotel and entrance true the backdoor 
488429,Hotel Da Vinci, Wifi was a bit laggy due to dns server cache problems Local websites located in my country were hard to open , Room was clean train station is very close and comfortable to get there without taxi Staff is good explains everything 
488430,Hotel Da Vinci, Why don t you try to put heaters under hot food like eggs bacon and sausages , Room was very good We can t say excellent as we had ants However we based our booking on the fact we had stayed earlier in the year and loved both room general atmosphere and mega breakfast 
488431,Hotel Da Vinci, Entrance from parking space to hotel only stairs difficult with big or heavy luggage , Very helpful and friendly staff at the reception specially Giulia cleanliness all around
488432,Hotel Da Vinci, Was not in a good area and was surrounded by abandoned buildings Didn t want to walk about after dark , Large rooms and very clean Very close to the station and lots of parking 
488433,Hotel Da Vinci, The surroundings were a bit of a surprise The neighbourhood felt semi dodgy and the hotel was flanked by two abandoned block houses , Value for relatively little money 
488434,Hotel Da Vinci, Just a situation happened in the dinner We are together as a total 8 people in 3 different rooms After a dinner the responsible from restaurant try to convince us that not possible share the check , Very beautiful hotel Nice breakfast and pleasant staff 
488435,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast area to small to the number of guests Panic to Get a table Noisy and over crowded Breakfast was little boring NOT for 4 hotel , Easy checking in good service near S Line station and metro 
488436,Hotel Da Vinci, It is not so easy to reach hotel from airport It will take you at least 45 minutes from central station , Hotel is located in quiet part of the city You can come to the hotel by public transport in three ways Using metro line no 3 to the Comasina station and then 10 minutes walking or using train to the station Milano Bruzzano Parco Nord which is only 50 meters from hotel Third way is using bus line 41 and Bruzzano FN station Hotel is huge equipped with many facilities like fitness restaurants or outdoor bar with garden In front of hotel is big park In backyard there is huge car park free of charge The room are extra large furnished with style Best of all is breakfast Even restaurant is a little bit crowded variety and quality of food will make your day Plan enough time to enjoy in tasty food 
488437,Hotel Da Vinci, The staffs here could learn a bit to be more hospitable They appears to be rude unfriendly and unhelpful We informed the hotel we need to move our date by one day 3 months before our stay we were charged half of the room price just for the change When i checked at booking com there is still many room available at that date for the exact same price as we booked But a change of the date by the hotel satff for their trouble costs us 50 of our room price Wow It was raining cats and dogs outside and we wanted to borrow an umbrella to our parked car No umbrella No we dont know where to get one We want to drop our luggage by the front lobby No access to any private car strictly taxis only Sigh Not to mention this place is hard to find by the google map , Breakfast variety is the best part about this hotel Be prepared for very crowded breakfast area as this is a large hotel 
488438,Hotel Da Vinci, The mirrors in the room were broken and no hangers for the towells after showering , Good bed might be hard for people loving fot beds Huge parking lot with security Train to city center about 100m fr o m the hotel 
488439,Hotel Da Vinci, The bad thing is that you arrive to the mane entrance and they don t ley you in even to take off your luagage sending you to the back door unpleasent thing to enter the hotel from the back door especially the hotel is rated as a 4 All the beautiful that you see in the picture is cheap plastic as well as the glasses for breakfast The restaurant is extremly posh a lot money for less food , The parking is big and secure If you need to get to the center of Milan the train station is very close 
488440,Hotel Da Vinci, Would have appreciated a shop in the hotel that sold drinking water etc but not necessity Would recommend if like us you arrive late at night to bring drinks from plane airport as there s no shop nearby There is a minibar though if you want to pay those prices , Hotel was great clean friendly staff free breakfast every morning with good selection good wifi connection nice sized room with bath fridge in room Personally loved the fact that the hotel isn t in the city centre but is literally next to a train station that you can easily get to and from the airport city Would definitely stay again 
488441,Hotel Da Vinci, The food at the restaurant and room service is horrible and expensive If you ask for a late check out the day before they will start pushing that you go to the reception to pay for it from 10 am Like you would run away without paying Your room key is useless is after check out time even though you have paid for a late check out , Very large room Good parking lot free Internet is OK but it gets very low when many people are connected The check in and check out is fast It is a nice place to stay a bit outside the city 
488442,Hotel Da Vinci, We had an early flight so we asked for so called grab and go breakfast The packages that they gave to us were quite poor and insufficient compared to similar ones in other hotels Except from that everything was alright , Everything was fine The hotel is well located very clean and beautiful 
488443,Hotel Da Vinci, The parking lot is located behind the hotel on an elevated area We had to carry our luggage up and down on stairs There was a guy from the hotel with and Assistance badge but he clearly doesn t wanted to help with our luggage During check out the receptionists where very rude when I asked something she start speaking to her colleague in italian and the guy just looked at us and started laughing Other guests who asked for taxi or map also got some comments in italian so they didn t understand The cleaners ignored the do not disturb signs and knocked on our door every morning When I asked them about it they just talked to me in italian They didn t say anything in english At breakfast the full canteen was packed we had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table then another 15 till we get a fork because they ran out Another morning the cleaner just came in without knocking it was really rude By the way the hotel staff said the city center is in 10 minutes We can walk there but fortunately I rather got a taxi it took 20 minutes drive till we reach the Milan Dome and costed like 25 30 EUR I spent the half of the accommodation costs on taxis during our stay , The WiFi was really fast 
488444,Hotel Da Vinci, Ugly and scary buildings around the hotel hotel lobby without any content and hapenning ants in the room, Free parking close to metro and train station beautiful and spacious room good value for money
488445,Hotel Da Vinci, There is a 10minute walk from the hotel to the nearest subway station but it s not that far once you learn the way , The breakfast is very varied and the staff is very helpful 
488446,Hotel Da Vinci, Location of the hotel strange Didn t feel all that safe waking No shops nor restaurants in walking distance we could find, Very nice rooms our triple room was huge Clean staff was very helpful and in a good mood Free parking Decent breakfast
488447,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, The staff were wonderful The location is fine for taking the train into Milan It is not located very close to any commercial area The rooms are large and comfortable 
488448,Hotel Da Vinci, Booking coms coordinates set me to a graveyard car park a mile away very hard to find because you would never expect an hotel to be between two derilict tenament blocks, Car park security
488449,Hotel Da Vinci, The beds were hard the rooms Walls were very noisy Also in the Night could We could hear other People all the time The People s who work there was not that friendly and smiling , The look cleaning and garden 
488450,Hotel Da Vinci, lift was tinny and not enough for the hotel breakfast was not good at all no facility inside the hotel security was rude and staff was not very friendly , place was near the metro station 
488451,Hotel Da Vinci, A little far from the center but with metro it will take only 20 minutes , The hotel it s nice we had a large and comfortable room And the breakfeast was really good Also the receptionists were always kind with us 
488452,Hotel Da Vinci, Mosquitoes you can not run or hide from them because they will find you wherever you are in Milan Hotel or the City Centre and their bites will stay on your skin for weeks So be careful as much as you can No restaurants or shops nearby , Room very clean and spacious with a good shower Very safe parking in front of the Hotel with plenty of spaces Train station just across the Hotel Tube 10 minutes by walk 20 minutes to the City by tube Very friendly staff Various breakfast that goes even after the time provided They constantly top up the trays by food Very good Wi Fi in the room or wherever you in the Hotel We had a great time at the Hotel 
488453,Hotel Da Vinci, Nothing, Th appearance of this hotel in it s bright colour worried us on arrival we were only here for one night but have to say it was ideal for us Breakfast was good with plenty of choice and rooms were spacious with everything you could need tea and coffee facilities would be useful though 
488454,Hotel Da Vinci, Not at all like the pictures Very ugly and a sad feeling about the place The fire alarms did not work not very nice when you are on the 7th floor An unfinished deserted house next door Was happy to leave after one night ,No Positive
488455,Hotel Da Vinci, We arrived due to delayed transportation at 11 30 pm There was no food available by this time and we were directed to the local McDonald s this turned out to be a dark 15 min walk which ended with a pathway down the side of a motorway The whole thing felt risky especially with an 8 year old in tow the staff were only being helpful and they were very nice In hindsight I think they could have found a space for us to eat within the hotel to eat and allowed us to order food to be delivered They probably don t have the authority to break protocol but in circumstances like ours they should be able to as sending a family out at midnight not knowing really where they are going and not knowing the context they are in seems a big risk The breakfast was also very poor Cold rubber fried eggs bleak selection of bread this was also at 7 15 am when presumably it has been freshly prepared , I thought the rooms were nicely designed Proximity to the train station was great 
488456,Hotel Da Vinci, The overall score of my rating would ve been higher if not for the staff and the things that happened 1 Found 2 opened bottles of water that were left in the mini bar This is a clear sign nobody s ever bothered to clean that room before 2 When I told the staff this all they seem to care was to give me another bottle of water but that was not the problem The problem was that if the mini bar was not checked how could I know the room was cleaned 3 In every morning the cleaning staff enters your room at 8 30 without knocking or anything Probably because it is a big hotel they need to clean it so early 4 They pre booked the entire amount from my credit card before my arrival then they asked me to pay when checking out I found myself in the situation in which I double paid the hotel for some time because the first amount blocked was returned after a few days I know the money did not go to them but if you PREBOOK the entire amount in advance from my credit card why do you put me to pay when I leave Just take the money out of my credit card If you plan to visit Milan every day it can be far away If you just wanna get to Milan and then to other places in the north Como etc it s great , It s a huge hotel with nice big rooms comfortable bed and very nice facilities in the room Everything is new and for us the location was good JUST BECAUSE we wanted to travel to COMO and the train had a stop right there 
488457,Hotel Da Vinci, If you want to experience Milan don t stay here You re a 30 min train ride from the city and there are nothing but apartment buildings around the hotel ,No Positive
488458,Hotel Da Vinci, The reception service was not good I had to wait 15 minutes to check in and 20 minutes to get an answer about the location of nearby laundry The reception is always busy and the service is very slow The metro is very far from the hotel If you don t have a car I d recommend not to stay here , The room was big 
488459,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, great hotel near the train station few minutes to centrale Duomo beautiful designed hotel well maintained room public areas are very clean very helpful staff good breakfast very recomended very good value for money
488460,Hotel Da Vinci, The only bad thing is the mosquito bites and the hotel management is not doing any thing about it and they don t spray the hotel my wife needed to go to the hospital and we canceled the whole trip because she had allergies ,No Positive
488461,Hotel Da Vinci, Location is a bit far away from city walking to metro station takes about 10 minutes Breakfast had good variety but quality of the food was just average , Good quality modern hotel with spacious rooms Buffet breakfast had a lot of variety Great free private parking Great value for money 
488462,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, very nice clean a comfy rooms breakfast was great location though far from town but was 100 meters from train station so ok to go book well in time and get a good deal
488463,Hotel Da Vinci, The general atmosphere of the hotel people approach and services very ceap The room amneties almost extinct The bathroom needs serious plumbing services The quality of the design and furniture extremely low ,No Positive
488464,Hotel Da Vinci, Booking com gave us a room rate that was very affordable for two rooms for us and our 4 teenagers When we got to the hotel they told us that rate was for two single beds and two people They charged us 100 euros more plus 5 euros city tax per person another 20 euros to get two rooms with double beds This property was also a 20 euro taxi ride from Milano Centrale train station and a 50 euro taxi ride to Milan Linate airport where we had to go the next morning All in all it was a nice clean hotel but not the bargain as advertised on Booking com , Nice restaurant downstairs with good food 
488465,Hotel Da Vinci, Asked for electric kettle before arrival and three times after arrival but didn t get and staff was very rude for not providing us Quilts were not cleaned Hotel is located at very isolated place and next to abandoned building, Good Breakfast big parking spacious room
488466,Hotel Da Vinci, Cleaning personel knocked on our door between 0830 and 0930 both days we stayed there and even on our check out day check out before 12 00 Thats is way too early , We booked this hotel because we rented a car and I didnt want to drive too far into Milano Center The hotel is 10 15min walk from Comasina Metro Station which takes about 15 minutes to Duomo Metro Station Good standard for money large rooms and not too far to travel into Milano Centro Good breakfast 
488467,Hotel Da Vinci, Lots of mosquitos as soon as you step outside hotel door Some in the restaurant downstairs as well , Overall good value for money Very clean and spacious rooms Food was delicious My kids loved the lasagna 
488468,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast could be improved It was very hot outside and the air conditioning in the room was not able to properly cool down the room, free of charge parking available outside
488469,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Unbeatable price quality ratio Parking great breakfast to 11am early check in from 2pm late check out to 12am close to metro station 30 min to center Duomo comfortable and quiet room 
488470,Hotel Da Vinci, Our room was on the 8th floor and we were kept awake during the night with the sound of the lift Apart from that the room was stylishly decorated and very well laid out , Staff were so helpful we couldn t fault them Thank you x
488471,Hotel Da Vinci, There were no pancakes at very crowded noisy breakfast despite the delicious looking picture Bed was large superior double room but mattress was very hard Bathroom was clean looking but smelly seaweed sewage and ants kept appearing no matter how many I squished on the 8th floor There was nowhere to hang any towels up to dry except a hook inside the shower Elevator arrival bells were much too loud we could hear them from our room at the end of the hall furthest away from the elevators from all the floors wake up at night for whatever reason Good luck getting back to sleep with the bells going off every two minutes , Hotel is right next to the train station Room rate is excellent 
488472,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Our family of 4 2 adults 2 kids under 10 stayed at this property in July 2017 To be honest we had a mixed experience On the plus side we appreciated the complementary parking and the complementary breakfast Our room was clean with good water pressure though everything looked old dated The property is also within walking distance 10 minutes to the Milan subway system On the negative side the staff at the front desk and especially the front gate are unfriendly and we did not feel safe outside the hotel area after dusk I would recommend this hotel if you re looking for something close to the Milan subway system but otherwise I would not 
488473,Hotel Da Vinci, Restaurant s staff is not friendly If they close the door they will not open it to you even if you want to ask something , Comfort bed Good bathroom Railway station to get to the city center is near the hotel Good breakfast 
488474,Hotel Da Vinci, Light fixtures didn t works as they were supposed to shower walls were finished rough Carpets in the hallways were very dirty hand towels seemed like kitchen towels No hangers in the bathroom no shampoo or conditioner I was very surprised when I couldn t buy a AA battery from registration 4 star hotel should have stuff like that at all times and finishes that look like a 4 star hotel , Price was good staff was great 
488475,Hotel Da Vinci, I was very disappointed about this 4 hotel as I got stucked in the lift TWICE and the worst thing that even if I rang many times the alarm button NO ONE heard it Also the restaurant should make more vegetarian dishes I stayed one week and never saw vegetarian pasta , Good position and breakfast too 
488476,Hotel Da Vinci, Suppose a little far to travel from Milan But a good price, The bed was massive room really big too as was the shower Clean and stylish From Milan Central station we got the train change at Afori FN is just one stop on the 2nd train get off at Bruzzano station Hotel on the left 2 minute walk away A 24hr train ticket cost 4 50 We used to get to the hotel check in drop our bags of then train there to milan and back for the day night Then used it the following morning to go to Milan again To catch the airport train from Milan Cenral That was expensive thou 29 for 2 probably cheaper booking a transfer bus
488477,Hotel Da Vinci, Bad Receptionist ELUONORA She act very badly and doesnot care about the managers there, Next to metro station wounderful breakfast and cooperative stuff
488478,Hotel Da Vinci, I don t like the security of the hotel During breakfast they keep looking or stare to the guest and it is not comfortable , Room is quite big and comfortable Near Bruzzano train station Breakfast is quite good the food is quite varied 
488479,Hotel Da Vinci, There is no restaurant nearby we have walked few kilometers unable to find anything opened If you want to eat you have to get in the city center Hotel have its own restaurant they have very good quality but price level was too much for daily eating , We have liked room with balcony 7th and 8th floor only Hotel have good parking and very good breakfast Since there is metro just 10 minutes of walk there was no need for taxi and big natural park just few steps away Also bed was big and very good 
488480,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, As I arrived the security man assured Me My car would be safe as they guard rhe car park at night Our room was more than expected with aircon and the staff were so helpful I will defo be visiting this hotel again 
488481,Hotel Da Vinci, The view of unfinished hotels in the right and left of da Vinci building Small and old elevators , The rooms are very confortable modern and big A very good breakfast The personal was friendly and receptive at our request 
488482,Hotel Da Vinci, Soundproofing of rooms doors are very thin Could not have breakfast as the room was overcrowded every morning , Modern hotel with large comfortable rooms Excellent value for money Close to motorway so easily accesible by car Large free parking 
488483,Hotel Da Vinci, The hotel is a bit far from the center but it s ok with the subway the staff weren t so pleasant the breakfast room is too small for the amount of people there is not enough seat for everyone at all the surrounding of the hotel are abandoned building which is a bit weird , The room and the bathroom are big modern and well equipped the price was really cheap
488484,Hotel Da Vinci, There was a smashed mirror in the room just above the bed made us question whether we ll make it through the night or not The vibes were very creepy the decor was not to our taste and the breakfast was not as good as everyone made it out to be I have been put off of eggs forever after that I knew the hotel was far but it was in the middle of nowhere There were really creepy abandoned buildings next to us the hotel s leonardo da Vinci statue had taken a turn for the worst and had fallen down after a bit of a rainfall It was a 20 minutes ride into town from the train Late night trains are not an option , The bed was very comfortable the room was massive We paid a small amount of money for quite a luxurious room 
488485,Hotel Da Vinci, seemed to be derelict buildings on either side of the hotel grounds and a good walk from any restaurants or bars , good all round hotel very clean and large rooms
488486,Hotel Da Vinci, Bad customer service not friendly polite and helpful at all Parking not safe enough no cameras around Not that good location if not having a car Breakfast good but could be better , Large room with modern nice design Very clean
488487,Hotel Da Vinci, Neighborhood is bad On the left and right side are huge old empty buldings it looks terrible Little bit too far from subway station , Room was really big Reception open 24h Personel speak english Breakfast nice enough choice even soya milk for vegan 
488488,Hotel Da Vinci, 1 Receptionist could not help out for an early check in at 10 00 although I m a Genius featured barely I had checked in after 2 hours waiting at 12 00 while I told the receptionist that my wife is pregnant and she needs for relaxing after long trip flight 2 Poor breakfast same options every day crowded dinning place , Nothing interesting
488489,Hotel Da Vinci, However the breakfast buffet is awful the worst one we encountered in Italy The most heartbreaking thing is the coffee comes from a machine although its busy operations they could at least make fresh coffee for all guests But the worst part for us was housekeeping On the first morning of our stay the housekeeper walked right into our room without even knocking and me and my partner were naked it was very embarassing Then later they proceeded to tell us we left our door ajar which is very bad as if anything is stolen the housekeepers will be blamed very unprofessional But the last straw was on the second morning at 9am housekeeping starting knocking on our door we just wanted to sleep as have a long haul flight ahead And around 11 30am another housekeeper just barged into our room this time no apology I work in the hotel industry and I can say this property has big issues with housekeeping Also had to request 3 times and wait until we received an iron Very disappointing , The hotel is quite remote but we knew this before booking It is incredibly beautiful and funky Our bedroom was amazing exactly what it looks like in the pictures with a huge bed Bathroom is very spacious and view from window is lush 
488490,Hotel Da Vinci, The room smelled very bad all the time Even if we open the window Probably some drainage problem from the bathroom And the location is not so good Far from the center , The room was really big and the bed was big and comfy 
488491,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast should be better, The hotel is just amazing very stylish new comfortable and rooms are very spacious Everything like in pictures Location is very good 8 minutes from the Milan metro station 
488492,Hotel Da Vinci, the restaurant was not at the level of the hotel food everage and what was missing is a corner with information on the way to go to Milan the stops the distances there was no map no real indication where to go to change for going to central station we lost some time to find out quite stressing , the size of the bedroom the little fridge large shower products for shower breakfast very well organized despite the number of people in the dining room plenty of everything coffee very good and personal very efficient and smiling the staff at the reception was very pleasant and helpful the decoration very funny sometimes but why not 
488493,Hotel Da Vinci, The room had problems with tv and could hear people through the walls and in the corridors even late in the night and early morning The breakfast area was like a train station and poorly organized eggs and bacon were cold and coffee machines not all working for the amount of people staying there many families with young children not enough tables and seating area this could have been better organized Staff did not seem to care , It was close to the train line and a short walk to the Metro underground tram which was convenient to get into Milan 
488494,Hotel Da Vinci, Nothing much , If you drive down to Milan this is a great location to stay especially for a weekend Good staff service Very spacious rooms Well maintained and clean Endless supply and variety of food options for breakfast Highly recommended 
488495,Hotel Da Vinci, Beds and pillows are very hard Hotel is too far from the metro station The quality of the food is not up to par with the prices charged The neighborhood looks a little shady especially at night , Train station is behind the property Parc Nord is very peaceful and accessible from the hotel 
488496,Hotel Da Vinci, No gluten free options for breakfast although this was stated on the menu , Staff were awesome They were really helpful and obliging Location of the hotel was good for driving loads of parking and easy to get into the centre with public transport Breakfast was substantial 
488497,Hotel Da Vinci, Definitely scared surrounding empty buildings like in world war all areas are not for walking , Good breakfast location is good if you are planning to visit Como Bellagio and lakes near Milan like we did parking space during the night is secured Excellent mattress and definitely quiet climate sleep like a baby
488498,Hotel Da Vinci, Poor Wi Fi, Big hotel with spacious rooms and a nice interior Rich breakfast Free parking on site and easy access to the highway to Milano Bergamo Airport Metro station to Milano City Center is only 10 min walk Reception is open 24 7 but no drinks food serve after 10 30 PM 
488499,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast and restaurant overall doesnt quite cut it for a 4 stars hotel and helpfulness of some of the personell cannot compensate for what it lacks Also some may percieve the tiny ants in the room in the morning with some unease even on 6th floor We tried to turn that into fun and it worked somewhat , Juniour suite room was sufficient for our needs and larger than the regular for Milan We travelled in and out of Milan exclusively by car and the location suited us very well Train station is though at the very exit from the car park which may be quite convenient for ppl choosing the train instead Nothing to see in the immediate vicinity but it is obvious that the property is maintained well enough to try compensate with green spaces flowers trees surrounding the car park etc and even maintain a security guy patrolling the car park at night 
488500,Hotel Da Vinci, We arrived early from an overseas flight but the staff refused to allow us a check in before 2pm although I m a genius member there were vacant rooms when we arrived , Spacious and clean rooms
488501,Hotel Da Vinci, You really have to insert the hotel keycard in the slot to keep electricity on Usual trick with random plastic card doesn t work here , Three person room was spacious enough and the beds were good Hotel design is over the top and some might say it s beyond tasteful Anyway the stay was pleasant parking lot is big and staff friendly Connection to the center is good with train or metro Beware ticket machines in train station are not that easy to find Breakfast was good enough to get the day started Lots of pastries as usual in Italy 
488502,Hotel Da Vinci, Service Cleaning Staff was extremely rude and even screamed at us Room smelled strange Facilities looked okay but were really cheap and not well maintained Breakfast was not good at all very bad selection and display Would not stay here anymore, Reception staff was very friendly
488503,Hotel Da Vinci, the colour of the hotel, Perfect position the hotel is very close to the motorway junction and next to the station Parco Nord 2 trains per hour to Cadorna centre in 20 minutes There s also a metro station at 800 mtrs 
488504,Hotel Da Vinci, We and couple of other guests arrived in the night in front of hotel and the parking guy started yelling at us that we missed the proper entry to parking in the back Very rude and loud I complained to the reception about the wellcoming but they were rather inferior about it The next day people got stuck in the elevator and were very stressed about it and so I had to take the stairs to 8th floor Again there was the parking guy who loudly again said that it wasn t his problem when I asked when the elevators will be in function again The power went on and off couple of times and the wifi was dead They have a nice outside bar but they had a one bottle of bear and told us that if we would like more to go and take it out from our room refrigerator The price of the beer was higher than in front of Duomo caffe , Rooms comfortable and clean The train to the city is just outside the hotel 
488505,Hotel Da Vinci, It s just such a bad location There are no restaurants close by and the only place to get food from was a Mc Donald s and a petrol station and they were a good 15 to 20 min walk away The 10 euro room service charge seemed very expensive to me also don t be excited by the extensive food menu in your room as when we called up none of it was actually on offer or available to us , Amazing room great bathroom very clean and an amazing looking hotel at a good price 
488506,Hotel Da Vinci, Even its written that pets are allowed you cant take your pet to breakfast room or restaurant you will be forced to leave your pet in the car which is impossible when its 35 degrees outside or you will need to leave the dog in the room alone which will end up with damaged furniture the first night we arrived late 23 00 and there was no soap shower gel etc next day we found some the price is reasonable breakfast was a bit chaos because of too many people not enough place not enough waiters for such amount of guests food or drinks are finishing so fast and waiters are not able to replace new ones or clean the empty tables ,No Positive
488507,Hotel Da Vinci, Not a single complementary 500mls of drinking water I paid 2 for this water I stayed my second night in hotel near Milano central station and was able to compare better value for lower price , breakfast was good 
488508,Hotel Da Vinci, The breakfast service was a bit slow and did not manage to serve the crowd eating when we were there be early , Good value for money The family loved the room and it was spacious and clean The staff was helpful 
488509,Hotel Da Vinci, The hotel charged more than 100 EUR from my creditcard 1 month before stay The whole amount was 350 EUR It was booked for my daughters so my creditcard was not there They need to pay cash the whole amount of 350 EUR and I still did not get my money 100 Eur back , Extra comfort bed very nice design 
488510,Hotel Da Vinci, In the photos with the hotel are not visible the two abandoned buildings in the side The restaurant have only one type of menu all you can eat in the evening without drinks that costs 22 Euro persons There are not so many options in the breakfast menu , Location is next to the urban railway station Milano Bruzzano Parco Nord Quiet area 
488511,Hotel Da Vinci, The man in the guard house out front was not friendly , It was beautiful on the outside The room was spacious Full shower rain shower head We were leaving early in am so they gave us a boxed lunch Easy to get to the tube for transportation to the center of town 
488512,Hotel Da Vinci, Buildings nearby are left from before WW2 reminds me of horror movies or Soviet Russia Juice in restaurant was horrible Breakfast wasn t good , Price was only factor
488513,Hotel Da Vinci, We had room 523 which was the first room of the floor and near to the elevators Everytime we heard the elevators which was totally annoying Please be aware themat you have to pay 5 city tax per person due to the 4 stars , The room is spacious and the bed is really big and really comfortable You have everything you need in the room The breakfast was ok but due to the site of the hotel it was only buffet and nothing special But you will get toast cheese ham cake scambled egg with sausage and bacon coffee and juice is only from machines but tastes ok 
488514,Hotel Da Vinci, They did not respect our request for early accommodation in the room So we could not rest after the road Somewhere on our floor there was a dog that did not stop barking and we could not sleep well Why are dogs accepted in a 4 star hotel There is no good isolation and noises are heard from other guests in close rooms , The hotel is very good comfortable bed nice bathroom friendly staff There are nearby metro and train to get to the center of Milan 
488515,Hotel Da Vinci, by no means a 4 star hotel in any way whatsover Maybe 2 stars no more Not even a kettle in room balcony and no seating Shower needs serious attention hotel is smelly mouldy dirty smell Barman downstairs takes 20 mins to tell u he cant make a toasted sandwich as he has no bread Barman is not efficient at all with service and drinka either, It was relatively quiet breakfast selection average to just above
488516,Hotel Da Vinci, Liked everything we were referred by friends, The decor was fabulous hotel very clean the staff was so polite and helpful as well as looking to make your stay comfortable Location next to the train so getting into Milan was convenient
488517,Hotel Da Vinci, Parking was in back and had to go up and down stairs to get into hotel All with heavy luggage Surrounded by abandoned buildings Felt like the ghetto around us Parking lot next to train station Room was right next to elevator and heard it all night very loud Mirrors in room were broke Restaurant in hotel opened at 7 30 pm therefore we attempted to walk to pizza shop and it had a bunch of men playing poker Walked back to hotel and drove around and attempted another restaurant which ended up being closed Therefore we ended up at a McDonald s Total fail in Milano Glad to leave next day , It was clean
488518,Hotel Da Vinci, If there was a pool it would have been utterly perfect , The hotel was amazing I would definitely stay there again I loved the decor and vibe of the hotel 
488519,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Big room very comfortable bed Very helpful staff and breakfast was great Its good that train and metro station are near the hotel so it s connected well with center of city Overall really great experiance 
488520,Hotel Da Vinci, Every hotel give two bottles water free but they took money for this , Bed and air condition Food very tasty Decorate was nice Garden is very big and place for sitting and relaxing
488521,Hotel Da Vinci, Although the train station is extremely close it is a bit of a hike to the city s center Small things felt a little off like the toilet seat in our bathroom wasn t properly fastened and there was always a loud clunk when you walked into the elevator but nothing that was a deal breaker , Room came with an excellent tub since moving to Italy I haven t had my own tub Room was exactly as pictured Breakfast was plentiful and diverse Tons of parking We arrived early and the staff allowed us to register early and leave our car and luggage Within spitting distance of the train station Good value for money 
488522,Hotel Da Vinci, Cons Staff attitude needs a lot of improvement Just sign here on a blank form that states in a hard illegible writting that your personal data can be shared outside Europe etc Really Breakfast loads of cakes and overall nothing higher than average Not sufficient tables for the size of this hotel that means you might wait at breakfast for one to be available Try to ask for a room in the middle end of corridor Ours was first one and lift is quite noisy , Pros rooms are big size with huge comfortable beds and nice clean bathroom
488523,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast was very basic and cold in general I would rather pay less and have breakfast in the city, Clean spacious room easy communication to city centre and nice staff
488524,Hotel Da Vinci, There were people in the front bar that were noisy during the night , Staff were efficient and polite We were given written directions and map provided for the local train to Milan a three minute walk from the hotel Room was large clean and overlooked the front garden Wifi in room was very good Parking on site was also good Breakfast had lots of variety and very good 
488525,Hotel Da Vinci, noise inside the hotel unfortunately some people needed to slam the door to close it some thing with a lock I figured it out but apparently other people didn t , very comfortable bed not so much outside noise but I live in a city so my reference might be a bit different good choice in breakfast Friendly staff
488526,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, The pictures were misleading staff not really helpful except a lovely young girl from breakfast can t remember her name the location is not ideal for a mini break bars and restaurants closed really early
488527,Hotel Da Vinci, I would have liked a bath Breakfast was only okay Buffet all you can eat dinner was expensive and not good once food was gone was not replaced hot food was cold Restaurant was under renovations , Room was lovely Good wifi Front desk Staff and waiting staff were so so lovely
488528,Hotel Da Vinci, It s a big hotel and very busy Bathroom doesn t have curtain and bath mat in our room , Staff was helpful It was clean Breakfast was simple but there was variety of sweet 
488529,Hotel Da Vinci, The hotel is quite big served by 4 elevators and 2 people at the reception Can immagine the waiting time especialy at check out , Good location near the A4 highway and also very close to the metro station 
488530,Hotel Da Vinci, More support for evening bar staff , Amazingly friendly and helpful front desk staff Thanks for your help Stefan Parking on property 10 minute walk to metro to central Milan easily accessible Located close to Autostrada precluding the need to drive through the city while allowing easy travel to other Italian centers e g Venice Bologna 
488531,Hotel Da Vinci, Tea Coffee in room would be nice , Amazing decor Super bed Great shower Good choice for breakfast and early start 6 30am for onward travel Free safe in room set your own combination 
488532,Hotel Da Vinci, the brekfast s scrambled eggs it s easy to learn how to make and keep them moist not advisable to arrive milan airport later than 2300 hrs no public transport to hotel beyond that hour thence costly taxicab incurred, the gardens around the property
488533,Hotel Da Vinci, None, The room the cleanliness the staff the breakfast the wifi was excellent the train and the bus were very close I loved every bit of it I would recommand it to everyone who will be flying to milan
488534,Hotel Da Vinci, Location Its a residential area away 1 5 kms away from train station Area is desolated with hardly any people moving around So it can get challenging to come at night It s gets a little scary Staff That s not a typical staff you would expect if you book by booking com Their behaviour was similar to Hotel staff like we ve booked a hotel with least interest in their guests Absolutely no interest in guests not even 1 percent of interest in showing a smile or asking how can we guide you around Milan which places you can visit etc Definitely we never got this similar behaviour in other bookings If we were to book simple hotels we never came to booking com It was as if we were dealing with professional people paid to check in the customers Say thank you and bye bye Poor experience , Breakfast 10 10 It was the best breakfast which we ve had on booking com stays 
488535,Hotel Da Vinci, The room had no kettle hot drink facility breakfast was chaotic and breakfast staff were irritating Shower was extremely slippery due to no shower mat The hotel is situated between two derelict buildings which is not shown on any of the pictures , The room was nicely decorated as well as the rest of the hotel Very clean comfortable and spacious 
488536,Hotel Da Vinci, I was placed in a disabled room and felt uncomfortable about it I tried the dinner buffet one night it was horrible not enough selection of hot food and other dishes like the salads were not fresh The meat was undercooked especially the chicken A bad representation of Italian food it lacked creativity Not a 4 star hotel not enough facilities like a gym or pool No porter service No 24 hour room service , The Big spacious room and comfortable bed The manager in the restaurant was welcoming and smiled which is rare in Hospitality these days The property was very quiet 
488537,Hotel Da Vinci, No seating on balcony , Arrived and was delighted with our upgrade to a huge room with a balcony would have been nice to have seats or loungers to use Great free parking and food was excellent Train station on site would be handy if needing to get into city for sightseeing but we were just getting closer to the airport for our flight home the following day 30 minutes by car 
488538,Hotel Da Vinci, The breakfast could have been a bit better for a 4 star hotel It wasn t located ideally It was a 10 min walk to the station and then approximately 10 min to get to the heart of the city , Comfortable big bed clean helpful staff great parking ability and a great bathroom 
488539,Hotel Da Vinci, strange neighborhood did not feel comfortable walking at night, recently renovated interesting interior decor decent breakfast good connection to city center
488540,Hotel Da Vinci, nothing , I enjoyed my stay in Hotel Da Vinci Rooms are big beds are comfy and breakfast is diverse staff were helpful and the hotel is luxurious Transportation is easy and close to the property you can easily take the train anywhere you want 
488541,Hotel Da Vinci, Hotel is located quite a bit on outskirts city and is in the middle of two derelict apartments blocks The hotel staff are great very polite friendly and helpful The bar areas were lovely there was no Mona Lisa restaurant on our trip it was replaced by a dinner buffet held in the same room as breakfast buffet to be honest dinner on offer was mediocre at best with the cooked dishes having lost a lot of heat certainly not worth the 25E cost and no where near the 4 stars hotel advertise as being Other eateries are not local locally a pizza kebab shop is 15 min walk a McDonalds 10 min walk Breakfast on offer was good standard and selection The rooms were clean however there were several issue regarding maintenance standards were evidence of broken and patched fixtures was visible House keeping very efficient at cleaning and replenishment of towels Although the bedspreads used were always stained Rooms spacious and comfortable the first half of our stay was quiet second half we were frequently disturbed late at night by noise from other rooms The TV channels were supplied if English is your language you only have a choice of news channels would been nice to have option of just one entertainment English channel The nearest Metro station Comasina is around 15 min walk away it is a regular service makes reaching the town centre easy a taxi to Centrale is around 20E with the Duomo around 30E A metro cards are available at train stations fro 24 48 and 72 hours making it a reasonably priced way to travel Malepensa airport gets very busy if your flight is early morning make sure you arrive with plenty of time A taxi from hotel to Malpensa is around 130E , Hotel is located quite a bit on outskirts of city and is sandwiched in the middle of two derelict apartments blocks The hotel staff are great very polite friendly and helpful The bar areas were lovely there was no Mona Lisa restaurant on our trip it was replaced by a dinner buffet held in the same room as breakfast buffet to be honest dinner on offer was mediocre at best with the cooked dishes having lost a lot of heat certainly not worth the 25E cost and no where near the 4 stars hotel advertise as being Breakfast on offer was good standard and selection Other eateries are not local locally a pizza kebab shop is 15 min walk a McDonalds 10 min walk The rooms were clean however there were several issue regarding maintenance standards were evidence of broken and patched fixtures was visible House keeping very efficient at cleaning and replenishment of towels Although the bedspreads used were always stained Rooms spacious and comfortable the first half of our stay was quiet second half we were frequently disturbed late at night by noise from other rooms The TV channels were supplied if English is your language you only have a choice of news channels would been nice to have option of just one entertainment English channel The nearest Metro station Comasina is around 15 min walk away it is a regular service makes reaching the town centre easy a taxi to Centrale is around 20E with the Duomo around 30E Metro cards are available at train stations fro 24 48 and 72 hours making it a reasonably priced way to travel Malepensa airport gets very busy if your flight is early morning make sure you arrive with plenty of time A taxi from hotel to Malpensa is around 130E 
488542,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, The hotel was too far out from the City However was clean and with access to nearby metro Would not recommend this hotel for solo travellers or families with children or elderly as the area didnt seem safe to walk back to after dark 
488543,Hotel Da Vinci, Extremely crowded breakfast room restaurant very few choices didn t ate there area is not cosy but i dont mind a few minutes walking my only and main complaint is the cleanliness of the bathroom it looked clean BUT vent is extremely dustfull watermarks on the sink and hidden spots in the bathroom not clean, Room was very spacious beautifull garden very good aircon very good bed breakfast was ok
488544,Hotel Da Vinci, Dinner possibilities in and around the hotel were bad They say they have a restaurant but it s not actually open and the buffet offered by the same place as were breakfast is hold is overpriced The only eating location in walking distance from the hotel is a McDonald s , The breakfast was delicious and alot of choice
488545,Hotel Da Vinci, the room is dirty the sheets had insects and I got infected You are treated like a potential thief or criminal They charge you 5 Euros if you lose your room card and they say it is electronic as if they are the only one using this system It was a silly hotel in the end , Nothing in this hotel is nice 
488546,Hotel Da Vinci, Noise from near train station and also from the hotel lifts also you can hear every foot step from lady in upper room due to wooden floor Restaurant dinner only buffet style not a la carte , New equipment in the rooms but small things missing Reasonable price 
488547,Hotel Da Vinci, Kettle and tea and coffee in bedroom More seating in the lovely gardens of the hotel Thanks for a lovely stay GPS could not find the hotel name but we used the street name a bit hard to find just look out for small sign post and a lot of one way roads around hotel once there enjoy , Beautiful decorated rooms big very clean comfortable bed windows can open fantastic hot and cold breakfast good coffee and Stefano at front desk very helpful Big shopping centre within driving distance Metro ten minutes walk and easy to navigate paid 1 50 to the city Train station right next to the hotel 
488548,Hotel Da Vinci, I don t think breakfast lived up to some of the reviews I had read and also I looked up what was on offer for breakfast on the hotel website and things where listed that weren t even out and we got down in good time before service ended I don t think the breakfast room is big enough as this is obviously a very busy hotel and we found it difficult to find a table and when we did we had to wait 10 minutes for it to be cleaned and set up with cutlery The food was only average none of the pastries were freshly baked and with the large amount of people the food quickly went down leaving not much choice , Nice clean spacious rooms the bed was huge Good location for Milan as the train station was just behind the hotel car park and it only took 20mins as was cheap Free parking which is always a bonus on when staying away 
488549,Hotel Da Vinci, No electric kettle in the rooms If you re travelling out of season the rooms may be cold Hideous interior in my opinion , Nice tasty breakfast with quite good choice of foods Excellent connection to the city transport there is a suburban train station next to the hotel Fantastic choice for those travelling by car 
488550,Hotel Da Vinci, Would have been nice to have had a bath after a long days walking The main restaurant was closed which was a pain and the buffet was expensive for what it was , Location is not great if you want to go for a walk but it is easy access to train station and only cost 1 50 into the heart of milan which takes 20mins The other way takes you to the lakes which I would recommend The hotel it s self is very clean and rooms are great size and comfotable 
488551,Hotel Da Vinci, Poor service from staff Would not supply bucket of ice when requested Overly aggressive and miserable security guard actually searching people on leaving buffet breakfast , Nice modern room
488552,Hotel Da Vinci, The size of the rooms the decorations around the hotel the breakfast is amazing , The dinner buffet is extremely expensive and has a low quality food The problem is that the location of the hotel doesn t allow you to go somewhere else so easily 
488553,Hotel Da Vinci, Room was very worn and dirty Bedcover was stained It completely spoiled the whole impression , The room was very spacious Breakfast was delicious and was offered a wide range of options Near the hotel was a large free parking and transport to the city center by metro was very convenient 
488554,Hotel Da Vinci, Not a big thing should have pre requested but still I specifically asked for a kettle at the reception as there isn t one inside room the receptionist said that they would bring a kettle to me shortly I waited for an hour nobody came then went down speaking to the receptionist again I was told all kettles had been lent out They only told me after I went down speaking to them again and I was quite frustrating with the inconveniences caused by not having a kettle ,No Positive
488555,Hotel Da Vinci, Tissues in the room Complimentary water Glass glasses would be adequate since it is a 5 star hotel plastic glasses looks very a hostel Security staff should have better attitude and politeness, Everything besides the Security attitude
488556,Hotel Da Vinci, Very hard to find the hotel without sat nav Not a very nice area nowhere to walk outside , Huge comfortable beds Great breakfast Lots of parking Nice staff English spoken Fantastic value for money Right next to train station 
488557,Hotel Da Vinci, We booked room with bathtube but there was only shower corner No shampoo only shower gel No blanket only extra sheet No wine bottle opener Only plastic cups in the room and at breakfast this is not 4 standard , We stayed here for 3 nights Got room on 6th floor with one double bed and one regular bed even only one double bed was booked Room was large nice and clear Free wifi Breakfast very crowdy but always found a table big choice good coffee The staff was cleaning tables very quickly as well as filling the plates with food Some travellers here in reviews complaid about the distance to the Metro Ok it was almost 1km but we used it once If you have 24h or 48h city pass you can use also busses trams and trains And a train station is right behind the corner so you are there in few minutes from hotel In the centre you can transfer to Metro Very convenient 
488558,Hotel Da Vinci, distance form hotel to metro is 900 m, Room size was good Breakfast was excellent there are 900 m form the metro station to hotel but is manageable It takes 30 min form the hotel to Domo Plaza 
488559,Hotel Da Vinci, Not child friendly although it has a huge green yard There is no playground or playrooms to be found The hotel is sitting in the middle of two old buildings which are in ruins abandoned and really depressing to look at Kind of a very scary site also the area is next to social housing , Nice rooms and decoration Good Higiene The breakfast buffet is a plus 
488560,Hotel Da Vinci, on arrival we rejected our room as the floorboards were coming up and tiles were missing on the bathroom floor mould awful The next room was way better Ask for a 7th Floor room the hand towels were like pillow cases they were not towels just pieces of material there was no kettle in the room it took 3 days to provide us with one there was no tea or coffee except at breakfast, The room was a good size and breakfast was good the tube was a ten minute walk away offering good access to the city nice pizza and kebab place by the tube station
488561,Hotel Da Vinci, No iron in rooms poor lighting no aircon during some of the really early A M period seems the hotel are able to turn it off T V needs updating, Free Breakfast staff very friendly Very big rooms lovely inside Clean
488562,Hotel Da Vinci, the breakfast was not so good Actually they offer a very rich breakfast with everything But the food was not fresh everything but the lowest quality We had also an open buffet dinner at first day it was the same Huge variety of food but not fresh not good quality , the room was perfect they upgraded the room for us 
488563,Hotel Da Vinci, The towels in the bathroom weren t clean and there was a lot of dust under the bed , The colorful hotel decor and room lighting was nice The location was great and fast taxi service 
488564,Hotel Da Vinci, The woman that I spoke to at reception was very unhelpful when I had a request regarding medication while every other hotel has been very happy to help The hotel is also in an area with very little to offer in terms of restaurant bars activities The hotel itself did not offer a menu just a buffet which is not worth the almost 25 , Interesting decor
488565,Hotel Da Vinci, The hotel is in a residential area with no commercial area nearby Only one restaurant that was open for a buffet breakfast and dinner between 7 10 If you wanted to eat at another time it was a 20 cab ride to the nearest restaurant The place seemed to be designed as a conference center where the attendees could not escape , The rooms were nice with good beds and bath but 
488566,Hotel Da Vinci, Hotel a little difficult to find , Newly renovated hotel with parking on site Highly recommend very friendly staff great facilities full buffet breakfast super comfy bed Fantastic value for money 
488567,Hotel Da Vinci, We found hair on the floor and on the chairs There was no heat When we complained that it was too cold they told us to grab some blankets because on April 1st they turn the heat off The A C is apparently only for the summer They tried to overcharge us for the number of people in the room and we almost had a fight in the reception Tragicall experience , The room was big and the breakfast was decent
488568,Hotel Da Vinci, Directions to hotel from subway We arrived by train and not clear as to which direction to go upon existing the subway station Hotel should include a map from Subway for out of town guests ,No Positive
488569,Hotel Da Vinci, The bedroom and the building smelled like cigarettes and the staff was rude The hotel is in the a bad area in between two abandoned buildings Not safe , Nothing 
488570,Hotel Da Vinci, We only ate breakfast one day Our last day we had to take the train to the central station and we did not had time to sit and eat I told my kid to get a piece of bread to take with him But the fat bodyguard that stands by the door stopped my kid and told him to get inside to eat I told him that it was a piece of bread and we had to catch the train We paid for the breakfast but we are not allowed to take anything But I can sit there and waste as much food as long it s inside The room was also dirty blankets were stain with some fluids the mattress was also dirty with all kinds of crap And it looks like they never sweep the room I did not like that it was far from Milan and the train does not run often It s also located next to two abandon building We walked to the mcdonalds and it does not feel safe around that area , The price but I guess you get what you pay for 
488571,Hotel Da Vinci, The only thing that I didn t like was to make a 5min walk to get to the train station , The hotel is very nice seems new or restored at least For the price we paid we were expecting a standard room with normal comfort but what we found was a very cozy and modern bedroom almost extravagant but in line with the spirit of the hotel The breakfast is very good and absolutely fantastic Regarding location and transportation the hotel is far from the center of the city but in Milan it s the best option The train station is connected to the main lines and in 20min you can get to the center 
488572,Hotel Da Vinci, The lobby and the restaurant are very poor We could hardly have breakfast for most of our stay The hotel is a noisy congregation place rather than a hotel , The room is clean and tidy
488573,Hotel Da Vinci, Aircon cuts off at midnight No gym There s absolutely nothing around the property For shops and restaurants you ll need to catch a train cab or walk a half an hour , Room was nice and comfortable and staff is friendly 
488574,Hotel Da Vinci, They are trying to rip off customers We did extend our trip an following day they come ask us to leave or pay 15 euro more for our rooms The staff is racist for sure The manager is also worst He said that you don t have any paper to prove so you have to leave or pay more , Nothing
488575,Hotel Da Vinci, Bigger pillow and shampoo would welcome , Massive huge breakfast Friendly receptionists Bar open to 24hod Close to metro station Quite location Clean room 
488576,Hotel Da Vinci, The rooms were not so clean The bed covers had stains and so did the sheets At 9 00 am The cleaning lady bursted into our room We told her that we check out later Than any time we went out of the room she asked us if we are checking out although the check out was due at 12 00 pm and there was plenty of time left , The hotel is very stylish and big 
488577,Hotel Da Vinci, It s far away from city center and there is no good bar and restaurant close by but there is a metro station close 5 min walking so you can easily go to city center , The staff are nice and the room was really clean It has a big and quiet yard that you can sit there and enjoy the birds sounds and fresh air since it s not in city center it is less polluted 
488578,Hotel Da Vinci, The day we checked in the receptionist Gloria was horrible she was frustrated and literally yelled at us and wasn t cooperative at all for no obvious reason because of her I spent the first 2 days trying to look for another hotel We stayed for 6 days and the breakfast buffet was the same everyday which we found dull more diversity would have been appreciated Ants Ants Ants we had to change our room 3 times in our stay because of ants that didn t seem they had a solution for it , Although there is a free parking area at the hotel but using public transportation was easier for us only few minutes walk away from the hotel you would find a train stop We enjoyed the large room suitable for family with children Because of our frequent room changing my husband had forgotten his wallet in the previous room which we haven t noticed until one of the staff found returned to us nice of them 
488579,Hotel Da Vinci, Limited only to one key for the room so if I was out of the room I had to call my other half to open the door Got a bit annoying The city tax of 5 per night was not explained to me in details although I paid it for the duration of nights I was there I afterwards regarded it as a big money scheme Thumbs down for that, The rooms were great staff were awesome
488580,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Convinient location close to the highway Big parking Seems old relatively small and slow elevators Type of a hotel which is perfect for big groups and bus tours huge hotel breakfast offers nice variety especially of pastries but not of best quality cheese hams etc Coffee awful plastic cups for drinks etc 
488581,Hotel Da Vinci, the chick in time too late to be by 2 pm no lunch preparation in the kitchen as they only serve breakfast and dinner the quality of food not good for 4 star hotel I could feel its poor menu , the art of the hotel new style which is different and amazing 
488582,Hotel Da Vinci, The restaurant not good and some of the staff are rude not respectful specially the one who stand out the door in the restaurant the cleaning is bad the towels is the same towels it s not replaced by new one I hope you ehance all of those, I like nothing
488583,Hotel Da Vinci, Not easy to find the hotel from Commassima metro station and even some people send me on completly different part of the place Not book the room next to the lifts as the lifts rings all the nigth Quite cold in the room , New furnished rooms with large beds and spacy bathroom with roof shower 
488584,Hotel Da Vinci, Day 1 I noticed that the hotel didnt actually offer shampoo asked the front desk and they were not very useful as i guess the hotel just doeant have any My rooms safe was also broken from day 1 Day 2 I had noticed a few things dodnt get cleaned at all in the room Day 3 On my third night I went to sleep early for my early train out of town and ended up waking up to some sort of dance party in the room next door at 1AM I called the front desk around 1 05 and then 15 minutes later someone knocked on the door and the party moved down the hall Only far enough to quiet down for me to go to sleep I could still hear them from down the hall but was beyond my concern at that point Upon checkout the hotel staff asked about my stay and were apathetuc to my complaints , The room was reasonably cheap and the hotel had immediate access to the trains Milan is a beautiful city and full of fashion shopping or historical landmarks for those that are interested so you wont need to stay in the hotel except for sleep 
488585,Hotel Da Vinci, Holdings either side delapidated but presume the hotel is dealing with this in the future if owned by them , The hotel was excellent appeared to have been refurbished recently to a high standard staff very polite and helpful on he outskirts of the city approx 5 klms to centre which was easy to get into by train or taxi 
488586,Hotel Da Vinci, my room was cold and they said they turned off heating at the beginng of april because now its spring but it was a little early to close the heating because it was cold in the room the security staff didn t let us go out with our coffee cups after breakfast we wanted to smoke at the door with our coffee he did not let us and he doesn t know english i can say that he wasn t friendly , The rooms and the bathroom is big and very clean the recepion staff is friendly and helpfull almost near to subway walked about 15 minutes 
488587,Hotel Da Vinci, Even if the Hotel is new it is not clean There is dust on the floor and specially in the corners Dirty badcover with someones hair which stuck inside Such basic things do not allow you to feel comfortable from the first minute in the room Warm air conditioning was not working At our stay it was around 6 outside No Heating in the bathroom no way to dry your clothing or even your towel Just one small hanger So to sum up we stayed there just one night and could live with it But were looking forward to check out We would not recommend this hotel , Easy to get by car if you are comming from Bergamo Airport Free parking with a lots of parking lots Was good breakfast with big shoice of food 
488588,Hotel Da Vinci, The hotel is situated in a quite unfriendly area and as it s a huge hotel there are crowds of guests in the hotel especially during c i or c o or breakfast which can be really uncomfortable But these are things which are not possible to change so we had a lovely time at your hotel thank s for the great service and just everything , We were surprised how big and nice the room was as it was not very expensive The staff is really friendly and helps where they can The hotel is really big but you couldn t hear any noise at night 
488589,Hotel Da Vinci, The maids were making too much noise in the morning while they were cleaning the rooms on my floor As I stayed out late the night before I was hoping to get some sleep in the morning but the maids kept on opening my door even though I had put on the button Do not disturb not sure if it was working , Very Nice Hotel and great money value Great parking The location was perfect right next to a train station and a 10 minutes ride to the center of Milan
488590,Hotel Da Vinci, It was very cold in our room Outside was 13 C by day and 5 6 by night No extra blankets were available no heating available it was horrible I left the hotel with a cold Also most of our group Also the walls are very thin You can hear everything from your neighbors phone vibrating tv etc , The personnel was very friendly Room was clean 
488591,Hotel Da Vinci, The shower areas need updating but the rest of the bathrooms were nice and clean More English speaking TV channels would have been good , This hotel is excellent value for money Free wifi was great Older building but has been refurbished A lot of families staying here Included breakfast daily was plentiful and fresh sometimes very busy but the staff kept up with clearing tables well and we never had to wait for a seat Big rooms with double beds that were very comfy Right next to train station for Milan centro Always felt safe and car securely parked in private carpark with security onsite 
488592,Hotel Da Vinci, While in principle the hotel should be accessible due to its proximity to the train station which is almost literally just behind it it is far from everything In fact it feels sad that the neighborhood has nothing to offer No bars no restaurants just one tiny coffee shop which is barely open and a bleak abandoned building next door It doesn t do well to one s spirits Best to go to this hotel if you have a car Otherwise you will be spending so much time commuting to this location , The hotel itself was different in a goofy eccentric sort of way But you will quickly get tired of that as it is not exactly designer level touches so it s best not to dwell on it Rather what is worth noting is that the better rooms translation the ones with bathtubs are really comfortable Staff is gracious too 
488593,Hotel Da Vinci, i stayed two separate nights in the first time the bathroom was quite smelly but next time it was ok a little bit far from city centre if you take the metro, breakfast was very good good value for money
488594,Hotel Da Vinci, Location The Hotel is situated between two huge abandoned buildings that also makes part of the hotel property The concept of the purple colour all over was a bit creepy Breakfast room very small for accommodating all guests , Price 10min walking to Metro is very good Room design at least here the purple colour was not dominating 
488595,Hotel Da Vinci, The buildings on the left right of the hotel that are abandoned and offer a unsightly view , Good accommodation at a fair price Attention to travel to from the hotel I expressly recommend those who travel the budget to use the metro from the center M3 direction Comasina to Afori FS station and then take the train for a station Bruzzano to the hotel using the same ticket 1 5 euros valid for 90 minutes Other routes mean lost time The person who made the photos for the website was the best the pictures are real but they were edited to attract you Rich breakfast but because it is a huge hotel it gives you the impression of a canteen 
488596,Hotel Da Vinci, Decor a little tired needs upgrading Bar not a hotel bar no comfort , Very friendly accommodating staff conveniently located near train station room size for family
488597,Hotel Da Vinci, The breakfast was dreadful The staff didn t mention there was a conference taking place over the weekend we were staying this meant the hotel was at full capacity with lots of children and noise throughout the whole weekend which impacted our stay at the hotel The sound travels through the walls and through the vents Ideally we should have been notified beforehand there were only a few people staying at the hotel that were not attending the conference The staff also didn t ask how our stay was when checking out , Room was cheap comfortable bed large room lots of space 
488598,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, I have stayed here several times Last year I stayed for one month in room 805 I returned again now in April I was extremely impressed with the cleanliness of my room which Staff member Morena was responsible ffor She in particular made me feel most welcome and made my stay particularly welcoming My room was always impeccably cleaned For this reason I returned again This visit in room 428 again my room is being cleaned immaculately by staff member Fatima Both these ladies are true assets to Da Vinci Hotel Both have professional high standards in their work Other staff members at reception and the restaurant have also been incredibly welcoming I highly recommend Da Vinci for a short or long visit It is close to the city by catching the train immediately next to the car park A very enjoyable safe visit once again I will return 
488599,Hotel Da Vinci, It wasn t very clean Had to wait a couple of minutes for hot water in the shower Staff at the bar was not very nice As if he were obliged to stay there Although there are 4 elevators one has to wait a little bit for one to come , Rooms are fun Staff at reception was gentle and helpful
488600,Hotel Da Vinci, The juices for breakfast were very terribly watered down But that s about the only thing , Everything was pretty much very satisfactory Friendly and helpful hotel staff nice large and clean rooms luggage storage service for people who arrive before check in time staff going the extra mile helping us buy train tickets for the first time There was a huge selection for the buffet breakfast And there is a nice park Parco Nord right next to the hotel for the people who would appreciate a quick morning run before starting the day Train station is right next to the hotel which runs twice per hour and are relatively on time for italian standards 
488601,Hotel Da Vinci, Little bit far away from center of city and for some people may be hard to find hotel because of a lot of one way streets , Great rich breakfast free parking comfortable big bed metro station few minutes away 
488602,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast did not re stock the food in the room where we were in despite it being 1 hour before the buffet was to close , Room was extremely spacious and the general vibe of the hotel was very fun 
488603,Hotel Da Vinci, You don t really have that much around the hotel Is great if the next day you intend to go to the airport or somewhere else but if you intend to have a nice city break and visit Milano and the city centre is too far for that , Very nice hotel we loved spending our night in there It is great very big rooms very clean and luxurious Breakfast was delicious too 
488604,Hotel Da Vinci, Try to add couple of staff to manage peak hours From property to Metro they could arrange a shuttle will add added value as in Midnight we need to wald an area totally Dark and there is no safe This is serious issue and we were very much scade while walking its take almost 15 minutes Also we came to know there is Public Bus service available if we could instructed by property management in order to stop one before the Metro station as there is no bus stop the one near Also my personal advice to such a beautiful property Do Shuttle service from Metro 24 X 7 Keep Public Transport Ticket so they can issue to utilize by Guest Break fast food is not tasty the can do better, I like the staff who received me at late night she is very helpful but the one who was in the morning is not at all acceptable and I know the reason she was busy to manage many client at a time May be this was impact her day to day work So I am sorry I can t Judge her as I was witnessed that she was very busy handling customer Such busy time property must keep additional staff to maintain the service level It is not fair to blame her too but she is not able to care me and I suffered from her answer In your offer my category of membership we got some privilege which she simply refuse which is not acceptable 
488605,Hotel Da Vinci, Because of the holidays it was crowded especially at the breakfast a long queue and wait time about 15 minutes in the morning The room was really nice but needs a bit of renovation one light not working small crack in the mirror , Second time in this hotel great again This time a superior room which was really nice Good value good location directly at the train station 
488606,Hotel Da Vinci, I stayed one night and that was disaster Our room was next to elevator and it was totally noisy All of them was not slightly slept until 2 00 Room was not clean and just one big towel So many people in the reception and morning buffet I could not believe why hotel booked so big noisy group in a same time ,No Positive
488607,Hotel Da Vinci, The only problem is that is little bit far from the city centre I know is hard find a big hotel like this in the centre but if you miss the little bus who is going up you need to walk for 20 minutes and if you have big bags like us is hard to get there, The room was amazing So big and very comfortable Me and my girlfriend loved it We loved the bathroom as well and the style of our room We will definitely recommend to anyone Breakfast is good too
488608,Hotel Da Vinci, Very remote location After midnight is difficult to return Very crowded breakfast room, Breakfast is a buffet with a wide variety of foodstuffs depending on your appetite Very large bed and spacious room Near train station Quite neighborhood
488609,Hotel Da Vinci, No matter what time we went to breakfast albeit first customer or half way through service the food was tepid , It was close to the train station and it has a lovely lake nearby
488610,Hotel Da Vinci, Double bed was terrible very hard to sleep on No thee coffee facility in the room Nothing to see around hotel metro is bit far away Those are the only bad things i ve noticed , Price
488611,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, The huge private parking lot with 24hrs surveilance is great Cleanliness and general quality of the room and bathroom was very good Personally I didnt need it but I think the fact its located right next to a train station is definitely a positive aspect Absolutely fantastic shower 
488612,Hotel Da Vinci, little or no food available from the bar the hotel is not in a good area lots of derelict buildings around no good restaurants in walking distance or even close driving distance Would not feel safe at night walking back to the hotel , big bedroom and big bed lots of free parking god breakfast We ate in the hotel restaurant 3 nights as no alternative nearby and the buffet is good 
488613,Hotel Da Vinci, Staff not helpful with guiding on attractions in the area, It was well located and great for commute to Milan There was no swimming pools and activities for young children There is a guide to attractions in Milan and about at the hotel but found this late
488614,Hotel Da Vinci, location very strange part of town Surrounded by two large abandoned buildings on either side of hotel When I say abandoned it looked like squatters would live there Quite scary looking on first impression in the evening bed pillows bed was extremely hard And pillows were worse Had a hard time sleeping bathroom For hand towels it was paper made to look like cloth breakfast was a churn burn school cafeteria style it was a large hotel and eating off site was not an option unless you took a rather long walk off campus would not return to this location, It had great parking and the rooms were clean And we found a great bistro nearby called Piscinin Risto Pub 
488615,Hotel Da Vinci, The two old buildings next to the hotel made it abit scary , The location was not as bad as I thought There s a station just at the back of the hotel
488616,Hotel Da Vinci, Location and it is in between two derelict buildings no shops or other eating places round about Fine is you hire a car Metro and train stations easy too navigate Back rooms back onto train stations and u can hear them , Nicolo very helpful at the front desk public transport good Resturant food at night not good 
488617,Hotel Da Vinci, Nothing special It s a bit far from city center if you move by car no issues I saw also a train station closeby , good compromise for car travelers free parking large and renovated rooms
488618,Hotel Da Vinci, No tea making facilities in room Breakfast at certain times in the dining room is chaotic and on one day I found it stressful trying to find a free table to eat at other days was fine It is also a good 30 minute journey to get into town for sightseeing although the nearby parks are cute There s also no nearby restaurants or shops for bits and pieces , Huge warm room with bath nice grounds to have a drink in next to Bruzzano station and 15 20 minutes walk to Comasina direct line to Duomo good selection of food at breakfast quiet surroundings friendly staff nice view from room 
488619,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, The hotel was located right next to the train station but the room was quiet It was very clean beds were comfotable and the brakfast was very good with a variety of choices We had a nice time there 
488620,Hotel Da Vinci, There was a strange smell in the bar area it was a bit like sewage A few little crumbs on the floor in the bedroom , The hotel had very nice interior and the staff were extremely helpful We needed to check out before breakfast as we had an early morning flight so they prepared a packed breakfast for us We walked to the centre which took around 10 minutes where we found shops cafes restaurants and a supermarket The room was quiet in the evening and we had a good nights sleep The train station is very close by so it s not hard to get around Milan if you re sightseeing 
488621,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Good advice from staff about travel ticket options We then purchased a ticket valid for 48 hrs which allowed us unrestricted travel on tram train bus and metro Great option for 8 25 
488622,Hotel Da Vinci, If you are in milan for business you and stay there you need a car Metro is a little bit faraway by walking , Room and bed are spacious Breakfast is very descent 
488623,Hotel Da Vinci, There were some stains on the bed cover but I just took it off Otherwise it was a good hotel , The staff were super nice and they were very helpful in suggesting transportation and ways of getting around and where to go Breakfast buffet was good The location was out of center but still really accessible 
488624,Hotel Da Vinci, Staff was not smiling and they are not providing appropriate guidenace about the city No gym in the hotel despite it is four stars , I like the room and parking space Breakfast is good and a lot of choices and the resturant has good space Train station next to the hotel 2 minutes wake but train every half an hour 
488625,Hotel Da Vinci, We was supposed to have a suite for 4 adults but what we received it was a king bed and a smal sofa bed that two of us should sleep on it It was narrow and very uncomfortable All over the room even in bathrooms was lots of ants moving We was afraid to have them on our bed The guy on reception told its like this because we are beside a park Two huge ruin buildings was adjacent to the hotel building cause us feels like we are living in ruins of world war ,No Positive
488626,Hotel Da Vinci, The hotel surroundings especially the abandoned buildings , The hotel it is located near to train station 2 min walking bus station 1 min walking and Metro line Comassina 10 15 min walking It is surrounded by some abandoned building which creates a strange atmosphere but on another hand everything is clean the staff is nice and helpful Rooms are clean and well equipped Breakfast is good with a variety you can choose from The WiFi it is working perfectly in the entire hotel 
488627,Hotel Da Vinci, Wi Fi pretty slow low temperature in the room the heating only works for 12 hours day from specific hours and mostly during the night, Very large room wonderful bathroom really comfortable king size bed
488628,Hotel Da Vinci, the breakfast was exactly the same every day cheese ham eggs and same desert hotel is located between two old ugly buildings really ugly location from my point of view , clean rooms nice personal good signal wifi the metro station is at 10 15 minutes walk
488629,Hotel Da Vinci, Da Vinci Hotel is located in Isolated neighborhood surrounded by deserted buildings this was scary , The breakfast buffet had variety of selection and the room was large
488630,Hotel Da Vinci, Design wise is not my taste but the hotel was very interesting and super comfortable Staying there again if I return to Milano , Although the hotel is not in the center it is very well connected with the trains The station is just at the side of the hotel 
488631,Hotel Da Vinci, The receptionist told us we had an upgrade to a suite but it was a standard room when I originally booked a superior We finally had the room we booked But it s very disappointing to see how they lie to customers , Good breakfast and free parking The hotel itself has a different style 
488632,Hotel Da Vinci, The building is old and the mattress bed were very rigid no ironing board or iron No heating cattel to make my own key and even they let you sign to bring back the plastic key of the room they are like bank rupt hotel its a renewed building with many rooms sometime you take a lot of time to jump in elevator to go to the room i will never go back again to them, Nothing
488633,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, We together with my friend spent 2 nights in the hotel The room was really great as well as breakfast The location is about 15 minutes from the Central station but still quite convenient to get there by metro 
488634,Hotel Da Vinci, unfortunately during the our stay time there was reconstruction and when we want to open the window for fresh air voices disturbed us I saw housekeeper near the room and asked is it possible to send slipper to us they dont know english it is okay but they understood and called to college for to do it and said me just 2 minute she will come and give you but unfortunately nobody came Before the check out day I asked that is it possible to do check out little bit late till 14 00 but receptionist said me for the late check out we have to paid 30 euro I booked the room 58 euro and how is it realistic prices that per night 58 euro but for late 2 hours extra 30 euro Usually hotels dont charging extra till 14 00 , Room was good and large beds are really comfortable Breakfast was good 
488635,Hotel Da Vinci, Not even a minimarket around the area mind if you re traveling with children and they ask for something in the middle of the night , Nice and clean place with a great breakfast 
488636,Hotel Da Vinci, It was far from Duomo and so on coz if it was walking distance it would been better but all in all it was good , The facility was clean It had very friendly staff 
488637,Hotel Da Vinci, The location was good for the purpose of my trip but it did take a bit of time to walk to the Metro station although there is an overground station 2 minutes away Although the breakfast selection was excellent it was quite chaotic as there were just too many people and not enough tables or cutlery , The room I had just a standard double was huge More like American standard than European The hotel is very clean kitted out exceptionally well and my room was very nice indeed The bathroom was large with a very good shower and the room service was also of a very high standard 
488638,Hotel Da Vinci, Reception staff were really bad attitude can t believe this is a 4 stars hotel It s even worse than express Inn really far from underground station , Wi Fi 
488639,Hotel Da Vinci, I got a noisy room was horrible couldn t get any sleep Bathroom was not clean for my taste and the toilet completely uncomfortable The restaurant expensive in the evening not worth it The breakfast was ok enough options but too crowded, Big room fancy design Stuff was professional and nice
488640,Hotel Da Vinci, They construction in the hotel from 8 am to 8 pm Which was very noisy The air conditioning was set on heat and could not change it to cool We had to open the window which was very close to smoking area and people were listing to music and we could not sleep well, The help from the front desk about our questions on how ti take the train and their knowledge of public transportations 
488641,Hotel Da Vinci, We booked this hotel based on an offer of 80 which said that the original price of the room was close to 400 euro per night This was far from true and i do not understand how Booking com can allow this kind of lies on its website We knew that the hotel is 30mins away from Milan however it is also under re construction quite a lot of noise throughout the day with not the best materials or service On top we were put in a room for people with disabilities so overall this was not a 400 euro per night hotel or room and thus not what we signed up for as we could have found another hotel at the center of Milan for the same price, We enjoyed the breakfast make sure you ask the waiters for coffee as they have a proper machine hidden in the kitchen and the coffee from the machines in the breakfast area is not really drinkable 
488642,Hotel Da Vinci, Informs on train times The reception did not tel us that the trains are only hourly in sundays not every half an hour so we were misinformed The breakfast box was so terrrible that we left it at the train station The only think was the water which we used No fruit no sandwich only stuff full of preserves and sugar Want to kill the guests , This hotel has no soul somehow it s modern but not comfortable or cozy the lighting is a disaster and cold I stay in hotels all over the world and this is not my style but I m sure some think it s a great idea I m just not one of those people 
488643,Hotel Da Vinci, The main elevators are small and take a long time Our door key didn t work three times on day one The mirror on wall in first room was cracked and chipped Our bathroom door handle fell off The front desk is always busy The view was of an abandoned building The hotel was being painted and repaired so it smelled and not all restaurants inside were open , They have lots of parking space free of charge The interior has pretty art They can communicate in English 
488644,Hotel Da Vinci, The WC Bath had not fan to let air out so some humidity and smell was in the room however the room had a terrace in front with a door which was opened to circulate the air , Price Breakfast Nearby stations The room had not slippers and tea maker they had provided kindly freely 
488645,Hotel Da Vinci, Located between two abandoned buildings that was erected and then left from residents awful Breakfast terrible warm dishes were cold coffee undrinkable food cheap Other guests strange ,No Positive
488646,Hotel Da Vinci, We like to walk but the area is far from the city However a ten minute walk gets you to the metro which is wonderful , We loved the breakfast the staff the rooms The beds were comfortable We really enjoyed our stay 
488647,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, I chacked in at 8 in the morning and the kind receptionist allowed me the key at the time which is much earlier so I will give the hotel the maximum score due to my full satisfaction The rooms are huge and renovated never experienced that big room even in 5 star hotels 
488648,Hotel Da Vinci, It s true the hotel is nearby the train station but Milano transportation is abit complicated for tourists and we got lost on the way the take away breakfast is very poor comparing to the hotel level I would recommend a panini sandwich instead of what was actually offered , A very nice hotel well decorated Rooms are very spacious and nicely designed Amazing team very helpful and smiley Rooms are well cleaned 
488649,Hotel Da Vinci, Staying about half an hour to feel forms at the reception when you arriving tired it s not the best experience, Very big and comfortable room clean and quite
488650,Hotel Da Vinci, There were no slippers and the shower gel was not enough , We loved the room design The hotel and the big garden were lovely It s a great place for vacation
488651,Hotel Da Vinci, Had booked two queen beds was given a wide and a narrow child s bed The bed cover was stained By car to reach the hotel s parking difficult A one way street in front of hotel will not allow entry Coffe was Nescafe in Italy Illys birthplace nescafee in a 4 stars hotel , Design
488652,Hotel Da Vinci, The hotel was far from downtown Milan in addition the pictures do not align with how this hotel actually looks It s really old and though it may be renovated shortcuts were taken As an example the bathroom s tiles are broken and rusty mirrors were cracked paint is peeling all over and the balconies are far from romantic Horrible views and also rusty It s really a dump in an abandoned area I wouldn t stay here for free ,No Positive
488653,Hotel Da Vinci, In room was a lot of dust on the floor also it was dust and also on the mirror Sheet has a bad smell I dont reccomend this hotel isnt for 4 stars ,No Positive
488654,Hotel Da Vinci, Bar staff not helpful When I asked where to get food they said not here rather than letting me know it was actually just downstairs No kettle in the room Walls very thin can here guests in the corridor very early in the morning and Sunday there was a dog barking in an adjacent room at 8am , Excellent breakfast range convenient to get into the city nice interior good beds
488655,Hotel Da Vinci, The location is not perfect metro is 10 minutes walk from the hotel no decent restaurants or bars near by stain on the bed sheet , Tasty breakfast more dining tables would be better though cool interior design friendly staff 
488656,Hotel Da Vinci, Only a minor issue otherwise faultless no night light low wattage light in bathroom didn t really want to turn on a bright light in the middle of the night , Magnificent king size bed Spacious room good layout great shower well located adjacent to train station with a convenient side gate entry Only few stops from city centre Buffet breakfast with the works Will stay again Highly recommend
488657,Hotel Da Vinci, Bathroom was not in perfect condition Missing tile below the sink drain in bath was damaged so we could not let out water from the bath Guest Anyway price is very good for this standard , Stuff is nice and helpful All hotel is clean breakfast was colorful roomy room Guests who want to use public transport have three options Train bus and subway which is more than 12 minutes walk away but it is still acceptable range 
488658,Hotel Da Vinci, The breakfast could be varied more every morning was the same food Hard to find a restaurant which is open in the area also any supermarket as well and takes 15 minutes to reach one , The price quality ration is superb the room was spacious and clean However the hotel is far from the center the suburban railway station is right near of the hotel and for 1 50 EUR ticket price you are in center of the city in 15 minutes 
488659,Hotel Da Vinci, there were two ghost buildings that ruined a little the view otherwise the garden was lovely, the room was large and I liked its design the hotel was near the commuter train station and it was very convenient to use the train to go to Milan better than your own car worry free
488660,Hotel Da Vinci, It was like a building site either side of hotel which we were never told about breakfast was like a free for all not enough spaces to sit, Reasonable price staff informative
488661,Hotel Da Vinci, The place is not near city center and I knew that before booking They offer free parking so it s ideal for those who are with a rented car or have time to spend on a commute , The hotel is exactly like the photos and is just beautiful Breakfast is excellent and with lots of options The room was really comfortable big and beautiful 
488662,Hotel Da Vinci, The only thing is that at 5 am I ruttlibg sound came from the aircondition vent from the room next door that woke me up , It was clean and large rooms and nice bathrooms 
488663,Hotel Da Vinci, Poor food badly decorated bathroom when rooms cleaned the tidied around rubbish instead of throwing away the blonde female who I assume was a manage was very sour faced and came across incredibly rude and impolite Staff didn t say hello when they saw you and guards on gate very inappropriate toward female guests as were workmen at the hotel Photos very deceiving And 1 channel in English and there were what I can only assume as semen stains on the grey bed sheets not worth the money we paid for it , The bed was big and comfy
488664,Hotel Da Vinci, There were some problems with the cards used for going into the room Later on we started using keys to unlock the room s door We were several times at the reception desk , The room and the bathroom were amazing The bed was huge and extremely comfortable The room were cleaned every single day 
488665,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Although it is about 7 km far from Milan centre Da Vinci Hotel is located near to train and metro stations The staff is helpful The breakfast buffet is huge and enormous Eggs omelettes bacon mozzarella cakes apple cakes yogurt croisants toasts juices fruits you have so many choices to eat whatever you like The rooms are big nice and clean every day I recommend this Hotel and i will choose it for my next trip to Milan 
488666,Hotel Da Vinci, Last night was awful there was a group of girls high school I assume with teacher They came around midnight and remaind extremly lound until 3 4PM Their supervisor couldn t control the group They were running and shouting in the corridors Around 2 AM I came down to comply the recepctionist immediatelly called security The gay came shouted at girls and left Girls didn t care so that was a sleepless night We were terribly exhausted the day after , The price in comperision to quality was great 
488667,Hotel Da Vinci, The personnel mainly at the reception is absolutely not motivated and treat you just as a number but worst is the location The hotel is surrounded by two empty cement buildings , Modern and clean interior
488668,Hotel Da Vinci, Bit further outside Milan so you have to use a train rather than metro but this wasn t a concern for us , This hotel was super friendly on our arrival upgraded for free which was a nice touch Outside of inner Milan but you can walk 5 minutes and get a train for 20 minutes and you are in the centre The hotel itself was clean good bar seems popular with the hotel goers and residents If you walk 20 minutes then there are a few restaurants around the hotel if you want a change of scenery Good free parking outside Good hotel for a stop over that has all the basics

488734,Hotel Da Vinci, Small area for breakfast we had to wait in the line everyday There could be some more supplies for example there was only shower gel and no shampoo In the end we had to pay more than we expected because there were taxes that were not included in the final price of booking com although mentioned at another point Of course booking com could be responsible for this and it s our fault we missed the reference to the additional taxes but I prefer to know the final cost right away when I make the reservation , Big and comfortable bed and room Bathroom was ok We liked that they changed the sheets and towel everyday Everything was clean We liked the design Breakfast was ok but not very rich No problems with parking and wifi
488735,Hotel Da Vinci, They didn t want to serve us breakfast at 10 10 even though breakfast time was until 11 00 according to the hotel policy because they run out of food Surely this might happen But the way they handled the situation was a total shame We were told that they provided us at the check in with a paper showing the correct breakfast time which wasn t obviously true After that they started changing all papers showing that breakfast is until 11 00 with a new one showing that breakfast for that specific day was until 10 00 it seemed unreal Moreover they told us it was our fault that we didn t read correctly the breakfast time from the paper we never received After a long arguing with the hotel manager who said that we shouldn t be complaining because the breakfast is offered by the hotel and not included in the room rate which is the most ridiculous excuse I have ever heard we were only offered a minimal breakfast at the hotel bar for which we had to fight for 2 hours Overall we have been treated very badly and felt like unwanted and stupid guests The level of ignorance was too damn high P S the bathroom was disgusting with a rusted shower hose and a clogged sink ,No Positive

488739,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast was an extreme disappointment lines to wait every day dirty and very basic poor quality food The hotel is situated between two deserted buildings and is in a terrible location to city with rail station only intermittent stops Walls are extremely thin and you can hear everything in adjoining rooms and to top of off there are roosters to wake you at 5am What the I would never consider returning to sum up here you really get what you pay for , Nothing of note

488764,Hotel Da Vinci, The name of the hotel is not visible from the main road They need to make a name sign as well at the side of the hotel so that clients may identify the hotel when they come to look for it from the main road especially after going over the bridge Moreover The hotel s entrance from the main road is one way and there was no signage indicating way to the hotel and we ended going round in circles through a number of one ways when we arrived at the hotel To make matters worse when we arrived at the hotel with the car we were informed that we need to go out and find the parking of the hotel at the back since they do not provide access to parking from the hotel from the security guard area Again the way to the parking in the dark was very difficult to find since there was only one sign but the way involved going round again through one way lanes Pls do make frequent signs to indicate way to hotel and to parking since it took us 45 mins going round to find the entrance to hotel and parking , The hotel has very large comfortable rooms nice bathrooms large parking area and good breakfast But no coffee making facilities in room although every thing else is a 4 star level It is just a 7 mins walk to metro to access Milan city You may park your car and buy a 24 hr ticket metro bus from the cafe bar before going down the stairs of the metro which is also open late at night The problem with this hotel is to find it since there are no proper signs when you come over from the main road 
488765,Hotel Da Vinci, I did not like the fact that i had to wait in a queue for the breakfast It seemed that the restaurant was small to cover the needs , I like the hospitality of the staff The room was very clean and maintain clean daily 
488766,Hotel Da Vinci, the surrounding is not lively the hotel is in a middle of two abandoned buildings which effect view feels bad , The hotel is huge good nice decoration and full of color
488767,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, This hotel is very nice there is a friendly helpful stuff it has nice and big room big bathroom It s modern We stay there the second time and we are very happy We would recommend this hotel and we ll stay there again Thank you
488768,Hotel Da Vinci, nothing special just I was surprised when they checked my credit card pre authorization almost one month before booking dates and that was not stated in hotel listing room was with free cancellation and usually in that case hotel don t do pre authorization , Friendly staff good breakfast comfortable room Very quiet neighborhood Hotel is several km from town center but only 10min walk from a nearest metro station M3 Comasina can be a problem if you have lots of baggage and you don t want to use taxi service In the same time you can be in the town center using metro in just 15 20 min for 1 5 
488769,Hotel Da Vinci, I don t think there is something that could change The location is far from the center so only patient metro users or car owner tourists will truly appreciate living there , As always a great clean spacious room was waiting for us The staff are very professional and the price we got was the best value for money in Milan Very close to the ring road to leave the city as well 
488770,Hotel Da Vinci, There was building work at all hours Despite being advertised and being provided a room service menu the only room service available was pizza There were not enough tables and chairs in the dining room for the guests so breakfast was like a zoo The food was poor and the staff were not helpful , The hotel looked great and the transport from it was regular 
488771,Hotel Da Vinci, With the property being away from the city more visitor information could be present as the interactive system in the reception is very limited , Both myself and partner were pleased with our choice of the hotel Everything we requested was accommodated the quality and freshness of the food available was great 
488772,Hotel Da Vinci, In this hotel they stayed at least 20 of Romanian tourists and hotel staff for them have not even thought about a TV station in Romanian In the yard are at least 4 roosters singing all night It is extremely disturbing If you get rooms overlooking the courtyard you can not sleep Rather large distance compared to the subway station Comasina , Breakfast is excellent as well as dinner The big and cleaning room 
488773,Hotel Da Vinci, I wish it was subway station close to the hotel instead of train station Latter is 1 min walk from the hotel train arrives in a middle of the city Neighborhood of the hotel was a bit strange it wouldn t be a pleasure if we want to walk there tonight But hardest thing were cocks they wake us up about 4 20 in the morning and continued to crow for several hours Glad that we re tired and managed ourself to sleep , Exterior of lobby and common areas is strange But room itself is great and huge 
488774,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Fabulous breakfast Whole building has been completely renovated since my last stay 3 years ago Very close to the train station that connects to the centre of town 
488775,Hotel Da Vinci, In the days of our stay they were building fixing the entrance we wake up with the sound of big machines every day , Its a beautiful building full of colors 
488776,Hotel Da Vinci, All breakfast food was cold during stay 4days Very poor sound insulation in the rooms , Good location perfect design rooms and comfortable bed Spacy rooms 
488777,Hotel Da Vinci, We had some problems to find a hotel as our gps had no exact address and all the streets around are one way streets , We got a better room for the same price 10 15 min by car from the city center Very near train station Very near highway Good breakfast 
488778,Hotel Da Vinci, I didn t like at all that when I put DO NOT DISTURB on my door a woman came into my room to clean while I was working I came to this hotel to not being disturb And how could one relax when at any moment someone can come in without permission ,No Positive
488779,Hotel Da Vinci, It is located in neighborhood around highway so bit of life less feeling is present in atmosphere , Everything perfect Hotel is far from city center but metro station is close so that is not downside at all because you can reach every part of city in few minutes Value for money is outstanding 
488780,Hotel Da Vinci, the location was a bit far and needed a lot of transportation to reach the center either a train then change to the metro or a bus and then change to a metro it was time consuming there are no nearby restos , the breakfast was very good and rich the pastries were delicious we had a case were we required an ambulance and the staff were very helpful 
488781,Hotel Da Vinci, The room was very warm and when you opened a window the noisy chickens in the grounds kept you awake, We liked the friendly helpful staff great choice at breakfast and the evening buffet was great choice and value for money tne location although not central had great transport limks to all Milan had to offer 
488782,Hotel Da Vinci, This was my worst hotel experience Please don t be impressed by photos hotel has on web It started with arrival No front door entrance allowed for guests only taxes allowed to enter hotel from front We had to drive to back parking lot and took us another 20 minutes to find the back entrance No house shoes or robs in the rooms When we called in we where tolled to come and pick up at front desk Two same type of shampoo and small soap for our comfort with very old washed off towels Complained about cold where tolled that heating system will be on only after 6 30 pm for winter season it is strange Breakfest very poor and coffe machine is shat down strictly at 10 25 by at 10 45 lights are off in dining room We tried to take coffe cup outside though where tolled to leave and take only plastic cups Russian speaking guards reminded me detention camp than hotel There are more then 30 steps up you need to clime to go to parking lot and especially was great fun at at night during departure to carry have cases with my heart leg , Room size 
488783,Hotel Da Vinci, They over charge me 180 00 for my kids Very small lifts No room for wheelchair Look very beautiful hotel in the picture but it s not Bed was not comfortable at all Next time I will book only holiday day inn , Nothing very noisy outside of the hotel some kind of bird couldn t sleep all night 
488784,Hotel Da Vinci, There could have been more pillows as you only get 2 and they re quite thin The hotel looks very out of place in the location there s not much around it but the transport links were great and only 10 15 mins on suburban railway to central Milan The breakfast was alright could ve done with more hot food in all honesty , The room and decor was beautiful Very big especially the bed The staff were all very friendly and let us check in early too The location is good in terms of transport links with the metro a 5 10 minute walk away and the suburban railway at the back of the hotel 
488785,Hotel Da Vinci, Poor selection and to crammed in the breakfast area Bad coffee, This is my second time at the hotel I always stop there as I travel in between Milan and Venice The breakfast was very poor compared to other times I was there the selection was ok and the coffee from the machine did not stand up to the standards they used to have What I liked was the politeness of the staff but that s about it
488786,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Nice hotel in Milano 10 15 min walking to the metro station Comasina then 15 minutes to the city center Hotel was good modern nice rooms clean big beds maybe little bit hard but everything was nice Breakfast was also fine great choice bit crowded around 9am We enjoyed our stay 
488787,Hotel Da Vinci, Early morning wake up from 3am Cockerel s and chicken s live in the grounds Restaurant poor more like a buffet and no option or choice for alacarte Eating out is pricey with an extra tax charged for the privilege At the hotel building work started from 7 30 am , Room was spacious and clean Breakfast varied with good baked items Milan is beautiful
488788,Hotel Da Vinci, Quite a bit of construction outside Not their fault but it was an early awakening , Swift and easy check in Very nice accommodations Pleasant staff Excellent buffet 
488789,Hotel Da Vinci, Be aware and check prices before you purchase and check all hidden fees because when I booked the room Booking com until confirmatin email showed 53 only in the confirmation email VAT appeared so total price was 60 90 But that was not it Booking com did not warn that there will be a city tax of 5 per person so actually the total turned out as a standard price 70 90 The room Bed sheet s were worn out and had hols in it Room was pritty dusty and some tiles were chip in the walk in shower , Beautiful rooms comfy bed TV free parking free WiFi good breakfast 
488790,Hotel Da Vinci, Some strange situation bunch of chicken outside in front of the hotel made a noise during nights Hotel staff said it was up to the City of Milan not their responsibility Roosters yelled from 3 a m every night so not much of a sleep , Spacious rooms great breakfast good location
488791,Hotel Da Vinci, The location is quiet disappointing better to go with the car The hotel is in between the 2 abandoned buildings that also almost equal of the height of the hotel The staff never answered my call when I m already in my room The sink and the bathtub are blocked When you do your booking online you still have to remind them what you have written in your booking quiet unprofessional , Artistic surroundings inside and outside of the hotel Huge place and a spacious free parking lot My room is large simple and clean with comfortable bed Well maintained hotel 
488792,Hotel Da Vinci, 1 Its far from center Metro station in 10 minutes walking You can reach Duomo in 30 minutes It was good for us We left our car on hotel parking and used the metro 2 We have arrived at noon but receptionist said that we can make check in only after 14 00 and there is no other options, Really good hotel The room was very big with big comfort bed Breakfast is good for Italy with omelette and salami also you can find traditional italian bakery We enjoy our stay there Room was quite with good sound isolation and warm If you looking for not expensive hotel with good rooms you should pick this one 
488793,Hotel Da Vinci, Everything was well clean and comfortable Except the main light does not work on room 628 bed lights worked well so the lighting was adequate , Excellent value 
488794,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, We liked the big balcony with our room Nice and quiet area Location is good Need around 10 minutes walk from the Metro Station Food was very good and friendly environment clean room and very good service 
488795,Hotel Da Vinci, We got told we weren t aloud to use the water machine for our evening meal as it was only aloud for breakfast An obvious coy so you have to spend 6 on water The bed only has one thin pillow each and leads to neck and back pain Hotel Cleaners didn t clean our room for two days Lasagne in the bar was served cold and was microwaved Restraunt staff favour Italians over other nationalities 5 euros for a small coke TIP there is a vending machine 200 yards away at Bruzano train station where coke and water is 1 , Clean and modern hotel with easy transport links from Cadorna station to Milano Bruzano outside hotel Most staff helpful however The restraunt staff were rude and prioritise Italians over other nationalities 
488796,Hotel Da Vinci, If you come for breakfast after 8 am be ready to find the restaurant overcrowded with no available tables However early in the morning 6 7 am it is empty , The hotel is located in a quiet area Nearby there is a train station The room was very cosy with a huge balcony The breakfast was amazing with a lot of choices of the meals 
488797,Hotel Da Vinci, We wanted lots more pillows for the bed so we could sit up and read watch TV more comfortably , The hotel has a quirky look and atmosphere that s really fun 
488798,Hotel Da Vinci, Hotel is located between two huge abandoned buildings and the part of the hotel is still in ruins They renovated rooms with very cheep furniture that only looks nice and shiny on the pictures When I booked a hotel I asked for the quite room because I was traveling with my dad who has heart problems When we arrived first thing we saw was a huge party in the lobby Turned out they had dance festival We were told it is only for one night No one ever contacted us to inform about this event First room they gave us was dirty with broken windows and cigarette aches on the windowsill It also had a dirty pillows with the hair The guy on the reception told us it is normal to smoke in the non smoking room from the window After my third conversation with the guy they gave us another room with better pillows and better smell in the room Despite the first information on the second night it turned out they still have a festival so again loud music until 05 00 in the morning people were smoking just below our windows and drunk people running in the corridors Third night was finally quite and my dad was able to sleep Because this is so cold 4 start hotel you would need to pay city tax 5 eur per night per person , Breakfast was really good We had fried boiled eggs and omelette and big variety of cakes The only thing is that all warm food was actually cold Location is a bit far from city but I liked the park nearby and cocks and hens that are living on the territory Beds are comfortable and really big I really enjoyed the silence on the third night and morning cockcrowing 
488799,Hotel Da Vinci, Some facilieties in the badroom were broken was not very comfortable all was extremely wet after using a bathroom shower must be repaired , Staff very polite I think it s the best what the Hotel can offer The Hotel itself very nice very nice Interior The breakfast ist rich and very nice plenty of all man can wish 
488800,Hotel Da Vinci, We were woken up during the night and in the morning by roosters cock crow , The Staff were all very friendly and helpful They made gluten free bagels for breakfast especially for me 
488801,Hotel Da Vinci, A little bit far from the center but it s simply to go there by public transport, Very good and various breakfast good price for such a good hotel we ve got 30 discount on our dates 
488802,Hotel Da Vinci, The breakfast was cold and no big variety was available One of the staff was extremely rude The coffee is never hot barely lukewarm and the food is not worth the money We booked two nights and one extra night separately on booking com But we forgot to book the day on between the two bookings so we extended our stay The receptionist said we d have to pay the same rate we assumed the same rate as the one from booking com and they made us always pay in advance We paid but on checkout we were told we d only paid for the extra not and that we still need to have to pay for the booking com booking The employee was completely and utterly rude to us and told us it was our fault for not double checking after her colleague I highly recommend taking extreme caution when booking here , It was clean and the room spacious 
488803,Hotel Da Vinci, Food we had dinner there was not such great Towels were found to be not very clean and some were missing we had to ask several times before we could get some The rest was quite okay, Cost was very competitive for a 4 Hotel room was very nice and comfortable Very good price for the quality of the Hotel
488804,Hotel Da Vinci, The abandoned building next to the hotel is scary Chairs at dining hall like plastic garden chairs Far from centre , Breakfast and staff were very nice Lovely decor except dining room 
488805,Hotel Da Vinci, Honestly this is more like a student dorm turned into a hotel Nothing fancy so it s satisfactory for a quick in and out stay The thing I was most upset about was the guard at the front of the hotel We didn t know where parking was so I just wanted to drop off my girlfriend and luggage and find parking The guard ran all the way up to the front of the hotel and told me to leave and couldn t drop off luggage I told him I wasn t going to park here just to drop off and he still wouldn t allow me to , Front desk staff are very friendly breakfast was above average and room was HUGE 
488806,Hotel Da Vinci, Chaos at breakfast Had to wait a long time for a seat More staff needed The staff were working very hard but had too much to do , Staff were very helpful They seemed very busy and could do with more help 
488807,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, We arraived late at night The reception persone was very nice and explaind us about the train to Milano The room was very big and nice The breakfast buffet was surprising with the variety and freshness 
488808,Hotel Da Vinci, No complaints, Easy access to city centre 3 minute walk to bus at end of street then train We were able to leave our car in the Hotel s large free car park even after checking out to return to visit Duomo of Milan again next day 
488809,Hotel Da Vinci, Shower needed repair as tap head came off in my hand Air con did not work We went to order a drink at the bar to be told that a 25 increase had been added to the list price They had given us an old list Only one bar at the hotel which was used for conference guests as well as resident guests 50 80 extra clients squeezed in on Sunday morning certainly not the intimate bar experience as advertised Choice of 3 meals at the bar margharita pizza sandwich or lasagne So very limited for a 4 hotel Felt like we had been ripped off , Large room bathroom
488810,Hotel Da Vinci, The stuff was terribly bad Not helpful at all They had a rude attitude hardly smiling and make you feel like you oblige them to do their job Many of them did not even speak english expecting by us to understand italian All the prices were very expensive eg beer 7 euros buffet for dinner 24 euros not including drinks Never made us feel that we were in a friendly environment not even close There were not the necessary facilities that could justify a 4 star hotel There was a lot of space both in the rooms and in the common areas however almost empty Only some plastic chairs and tables The bar was very very small with a very poor outlook Barman terribly rude as well I would never suggest this place and definitely this was not a 4 star hotel , There were few things that I liked in this hotel The breakfast was included in the price and was great and generous continental style Also the room was big although almost empty comfortable and clean 
488811,Hotel Da Vinci, We arrived early to request a room a day earlier than planned additional nights stay This was confirmed as being ok as was the rate that we already received We were advised the room was not ready and to come back at 2 00pm no problem When we did the room had not been booked Different satff member When they finally found a room for us the rate was not as previously advised The staff lady who we booked to room when asked seemed completely oblivious to the discussion we had previously had Basically she did nothing in respect to making the discussed booking poor customer service and a waist of our time , The rate and room were good as was breakfast
488812,Hotel Da Vinci, Some of the reception staff were not friendly and when you asked for any information or help the didn t seem happy to help don t even smile , The hotel was nice and clean 
488813,Hotel Da Vinci, There was major building work going on right outside the front of the hotel Realise that this is obviously essential but the drilling went on from 08 30am until 19 30pm during our entire stay Luckily we were out most of the day but did come back a couple of times in the afternoon evening and this was very disruptive The air con did not work and given the noise from the building work this meant that we could not open the windows and the room was therefore very stuffy The hotel also has cockerels roaming the grounds and they are very noisy from about 2 00am onwards constant screeching The noise issues building work and cockerels was the major factor in not providing a higher rating There were actually a lot of positives about the hotel and would return again once the work has been completed would also take ear plugs in future , The rooms were very large and comfortable with good wash room facilities powerful shower Reception staff very helpful though a little over run when we first arrived Very good for transport links bus train and metro Large selection of breakfast buffet items which set us up nicely for the day 
488814,Hotel Da Vinci, Very convenient for the local trains but no restaurants or anything else nearby A LOT of construction noise No tea making facilities in the room was odd as was being told we couldn t leave breakfast with a cup of coffee to take to our room Why , Amazing artworks everywhere very cool Very good breakfast Evening buffet so so 
488815,Hotel Da Vinci, Staff originally made a mistake by putting us in a standard room when we booked a superior Air conditioning only worked on hot due to it being October yet the room was too hot and with the windows open the cockerels in the garden woke us up at about 1am and kept going throughout the early hours This may not have been a problem if the windows weren t open but it was too hot to sleep with them closed , Most staff were extremely helpful and friendly Decor very cool Very nice breakfast 
488816,Hotel Da Vinci, It could have been cleaner but overall it is a good hotel close to the highway with great food However it was badly indicated We didn t see any signs then we saw a partly hidden P for parking which in smaller letters had the hotel name on it The hotel is located in a residential apartment style area near other buldings that seem like they are for business , The dinner buffet and breakfast was really nice with lots of choices The deco of the hotel is funky as someone else commented and fun if a bit cold in the bar area 
488817,Hotel Da Vinci, No gratis tea or coffee making facilities in the room which is a bare minimum I d expect from a 4 star hotel The location of the hotel is in a very intimidating area , Rooms very spacious and bed very large The proximity of overland railway 
488818,Hotel Da Vinci, Room a bit hot so slept with balcony door ajar but not disturbed by any outside noise Bar service a little slow but prices not too bad , Very spacious Very helpful reception staff Location great for rail station
488819,Hotel Da Vinci, We had carvery dinner on our first night great selection but again hot food not hot , We needed more pillows they came very quick Good selection at breakfast only hot food bacon sausage ect was cold Staff at reception very helpful 
488820,Hotel Da Vinci, Hotel is big so naturally the rooms are A C was not working properly Although we were sent to a room with two separate beds they corrected their mistakes carefully But they did not give us larger rooms which was available and because of their mistakes we were expecting so Hotel location is not so nice for people without cars even impossible for them to go to the bus station by walk Especially when they try to turn back to the hotel at night it is not so safe , Breakfast was nice larger than other similar hotels Bed and room was clean and comfortable 
488821,Hotel Da Vinci, We were placed on the 8 floor one room from the lift shaft The whole nite we had the lift dynamo run and keept us awake Not happy at all Also location is really out of the way And the area is not nice Thanks god it was for one nite only , Clean and practical
488822,Hotel Da Vinci, Dinner at the hotel was not that great but the area around there did not have many open restaurants , Really big hotel next to a train stop Everything very organized neat good beds Breakfast was busy food was good You can buy an all day pass on public transportation for 4 50 20 minutes to the cathedral 
488823,Hotel Da Vinci, Little things and details but you don t forget is not 5 hotel , Service was good staff on recepcion friendly and fast working room as on a photo clean good breakfast where you can choose from veggies fruits peggs made in diferent ways pasteries sweets cakes coffee juice etc Location is OK because there 100m is a train stop Parking is secured and big no need to reserve parking lot Good money for value 
488824,Hotel Da Vinci, In my opinion there s no something that makes me feel bad , The stuff is really professional and giving you an amazing experience of guesting The food was perfect I loved the hotel s design The area is peaceful and pleasant to stay And the transportaion of milan is really close to the hotel onley 10 minutes of walking
488825,Hotel Da Vinci, The bar area was trendy plastic chairs in Leonardo da Vinci hotel was out of place The area does not give you the impression of four star but a budget hotel Transport facility was incredibly bad for an overseas guest There should be a minibus between the Metro Comasina and the hotel at frequent intervals say half 0ne hour For that reason I would not recommend for anyone of my age There was no business facility I would not stay there on future business trips , The breakfast was quite reasonable There was apparent shortage of staff because it took a long time to have the plates cleared People had to que for a seat while holding food The problem was the management not staff How can you expect two staff to serve 100 guests within half an hour 
488826,Hotel Da Vinci, boring neighbourhood far away from the centre even by car more as 20 min drive diner buffet was nothing special I won t use it again next time I will drive to find nearby restaurant, good value for money close to the highway only 35 min drive with a car to bergamo airport rooms are spacious and silent
488827,Hotel Da Vinci, On the first day we arrived the property at 9am only to be told that we had to wait up till 2pm to check in I was gutted because we had made reservation and were told on booking com that our booking was confirmed This was after very long flight hours and it was our first time in Milan We had to sit in the lobby and wait Not cool Another point is that we requested to be checked in to a room on the upper floor but that didnt seem to make any meaning as our room was the very first on the first floor , The hotel was clean big and spacious rooms were very nice and beds were comfortable even though my husband and i had to join the single beds to make one big bed Staff were not bad and the location though on the out skirt of Milan was a few minutes to the metro station The staff were also very helpful with description of how to get around the city Nice 
488828,Hotel Da Vinci, Terrible view of 2 abandoned buildings in various stages of decay left right looked like nobody wanted to pay to have the old hotel demolished and removed NOISY The walls are paper thin and a flock of roosters in the front yard started their annoying crowing before daylight and never let up Thermostat couldn t find one ended up turning the system off No hooks or bars anywhere for the towels really only one inside the shower No restroom shower vent switch makes for a steamy and or stinky lifestyle , Bright and clean room Everything was pretty new 2016 Breakfast had good variety and plenty of everything and was a good average Wifi worked all the time and was free
488829,Hotel Da Vinci, Crowd in the breakfast room we had no place to sit down , Bed was very comfortable and large Wifi in room was great breakfast and location were very good We ll come again 
488830,Hotel Da Vinci, N A, Excellent staff friendly and helpful Rooms very large modern and impecably clean MonaLisa Restaurant very good and in addition free included breakfast very generous selection Free parking and fantastic to be right next to the train station and a Km walk to the metro Value for money for 4 Stars 
488831,Hotel Da Vinci, The neighbours roosters are shocking Had to keep windows closed and give up on our sleep in but in the end it was a good thing because we were there to experience Milan not to sleep , The interior design is so interesting in the hotel you feel like you are still exploring even when you have finished a big day of seeing Milan Both the breakfast and dinner buffets were of extremely high standard great range while still staying true to the authentic Italian experience 
488832,Hotel Da Vinci, The parking is outside of the hotel The hotel is far from central station , The room is big nice modern The breakfast buffet is good The parking is free 
488833,Hotel Da Vinci, Strange location in residential area no shops or cafes close Handy to metro was OK for 1 night would choose elsewhere next time , Rooms were modern decor is very funky Nice breakfast
488834,Hotel Da Vinci, There is not too many restaurants other services around the hotel the area is a bit isolated However you can go quickly to city center so it s not big deal , The room is really spacious modern and beautifully decorated The bed was very comfy and everything was clean and in good conditions Wide variety for breakfast Very big hotel but correctly managed 10 15 minutes walking to metro station with direct conexion with Piazza del Duomo We got a very good value for money the breakfast and the parking were included It is a real 4 stars hotel 
488835,Hotel Da Vinci, nothing, Its a new hotel i love the stile and very comfortable If you arrived by car its easy to find it and they are offering free parking that is very important on Milano But you can used the train or metro Yellow line that are very closed A big park its so closed of hotel you cant believe that you are in Milano Staff was excellent and the breakfast amassing Room is big and bathroom too i will advese to everybody 
488836,Hotel Da Vinci, The location is not perfect for new comers to find If you are carrying big luggages I won t recommend , Breakfast is good The bed and pillows are fantastic The only thing is that it locates at outskirt of the city You need 25 min metro and 10 min walking before you find it in a very quiet neighbourhood 
488837,Hotel Da Vinci, Nothing , My all time home in Milan what else to say about Da Vinci See you soon guys next time expecting some treats for this constant visitor 
488838,Hotel Da Vinci, Everything was as expected Just a little far from Milan Center City , The front lobby staff Very friendly breakfast was great The beds were comfortable 
488839,Hotel Da Vinci, The location It is far but if you re not bothered by the huge shopping of Milan and just want to have a relaxing night at a good price it is perfect , This was such a surprise We paid such a small amount and it was so fresh clean and well equipped Especially as I was travelling with my sister we were upgraded and two double beds in our room The colour scheme really works and goes throughout The beds were comfortable and the showers were great Check out at 12 is perfect Breakfast was amazing so much choice and no limitations 
488840,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Close to metro stop Outside of city so you get away from the business of the downtown area but easy to get to Great breakfast and buffet for dinner Good bar at night in lobby Great staff 
488841,Hotel Da Vinci, Room need cattle for tea and coffee Alreasy it has mini bar , Very nice hotel Breakfast was good Also room was very good and was cleaned I like it I extend one day more in same hotel 
488842,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, The hotel is clean Its very far from town It takes 30 min even by train from Duomo The hotel has few roosters in its yard They make noise from 4 AM to 7 AM So if your sleep is light you better have a room to face to the othwr side
488843,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Rooms were a good size beds comfortable staff were lovely breakfast was good and everything was clean I loved the art throughout the communal areas and the overall image of the hotel It was very well thought out and well maintaned 
488844,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, If you travel with a car this hotel is for you 1 Free parking 2 15 minutes walk to the metro station Comasina from this station 15 minutes ride to the center 3 Good breakfast 4 The price for a room is reasonable
488845,Hotel Da Vinci, Need a couple more towel rails would love tea bags and electric kettle and some glasses not plastic and tea cups , Even though out of town the staff were so positive and explained the best ways to get around The room was very spacious plenty of room for our big bags Great breakfast
488846,Hotel Da Vinci, Staff are tired and looked bored and in hurry to answer my questions Most likely they are overwhelm with loads of tourist bus that keep pouring in Bed are super hard and there is no duvet I did not enjoy and did not have a good sleep for both night The bathroom has no bathtub and no complementary water either The decoration in the room look empty there aren t anything much besides the big room I wonder how they get the 4 star rating from perhaps due to its size One last thing next to the main buildings there are two unfinished buildings , Big parking big room near to train station 
488847,Hotel Da Vinci, I didn t get a homely feel from this hotel didn t like that there seemed to be nothing close by no where to eat and surround by car parks not like the grounds on the pictures , The rooms were very modern and very clean some of the staff were friendly whilst others couldn t even crack a smile 
488848,Hotel Da Vinci, Location is a little far from center and area around is not exactly fantastic bur for une night stay it was pretty ok, Staff attentive and polite good restaurant and breakfast comfortable and clean rooms
488849,Hotel Da Vinci, Small bar for such a large hotel and not well attended by staff Breakfast area reminded me of cafe in a well known Swedish furniture store , Good sized room Free parking Close to train Very clean Excellent value
488850,Hotel Da Vinci, Bit far for older traveller to walk to station however there is a bus close by Big abandoned high rise buildings on either side give bad impression of a very nice hotel, Interesting imaginative decor Very modern large room Lovely breakfast Nice gardens Only 10mins by metro to duomo but 15 min walk to nearest station 
488851,Hotel Da Vinci, I was highly disappointed by the location of this hotel It was not good choice Secondly I booked one room with two adults my child of age 10 years but they charged me extra amount per night for my child The staff was very rude at that time I will not recommend this hotel to anyone One more thing you should bring your drinking water with you while staying in this hotel , I like hotels at place near to shopping malls restaurants and easy access for transport 
488852,Hotel Da Vinci, A little out of the way from the main tourist areas Easy enough to get a train to the main city area but not much to do in the area of the hotel itself In fact nothing at all to do so be prepared to travel to the city for entertainment and food etc , Modern and artistic spaces well designed building with clean roomy and comfortable rooms The hotel itself is amazing and with FREE car park with security 
488853,Hotel Da Vinci, The location can be irritating It was a 12 to 15 minutes walk from Comasina metro station You may be irritated by noise of other neighbors at night Also the lighting of the rooms can be improved And about the receptionists although some of them were kind and friendly others were not as kind and helpful maybe because they were busy and tired , The rooms were super spacious and clean the best aspect of the hotel The bathroom was really nice The rooms facing the entrance door had a nice view Breakfast was nice Wifi was really good I didn t have any problems with it 
488854,Hotel Da Vinci, Charged us for one night a week before check in although they should not have , Spacious room comfortable bed very good location clean nice equipment 
488855,Hotel Da Vinci, Insufficient staffing at Mona Lisa restaurant meant for a delay in being initially acknowledged and seated and then delay in order taken Suggestion for a dedicated person to greet and seat guests , Return guest as stayed here last year Safe staff pleasant cleanliness iand standard of facilities excellent breakfast choice Wifi free and user friendly Hotel next to train station with no noise and a km or two walk from the metro and shops
488856,Hotel Da Vinci, There s nothing I didn t like from the hotel In a quiet area but transport is near , Very clean hotel and breakfast is great keeping you full for a day Restaurant is also good 
488857,Hotel Da Vinci, Alghough the location is not far from Milano center 20 min drive it was difficult to locate the hotel The adrees in the booking confirmation cannot be found by GBS I had to call the hotel and they add one more word to the adrees Privata if I still spell it correctly I also did not like the fact that I breakfast buffet was the same for 6 DAYS got sick from eating almost the same every day , Free parking and Wifi Specious room 
488858,Hotel Da Vinci, Parking address is not given on website for GPS no sign on the street when you turn into the one way road of the hotel that you are wrong when you arrive at gate entrance you learn that you have to drive 1 extra km to drive around buildings and go to official parking lot which is on the side Even after 2nd visit I missed it again Very frustrating , very good ratio price service
488859,Hotel Da Vinci, Information re trains and buses in hotel Train to back of hotel yet not aware Bus services outside also however to the non fluent travellers it is a little tricky working out where you are and where you are going, Decor outstanding Room huge and comfortable breakfast buffet excellent Only issue hot food not kept warm
488860,Hotel Da Vinci, The rooms are not near sound proof Lots of noise from the hall other rooms and whenever people open and close their doors , Big spacious rooms free parking 
488861,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Nice location next to main motorway next to train station 10 mins away from metro station Comfortable rooms extra nice breakfast free parking Stuff was really nice I was serviced by Stefano and this is a bonus 
488862,Hotel Da Vinci, Walk from parking to the hotel through the high stairs , Old hotel from 70s but totally restored very nice design Rooms are very spacious breakfasts very nice It is located 5 minutes walk from the subway station 
488863,Hotel Da Vinci, The food prices at the bar are a bit outrageous but then it s a 4 hotel so that s kinda expected There s not much to do around the place at night other than walk around again the neighbourhood is quite safe A pool is really the only thing this place is missing , We had some reservations about the location but it was perfectly fine a 15 minute stroll to the subway which takes you to the city centre in about 20 25 minutes for 1 60 2016 price through a very safe neighbourhood despite the way it looks Also very close to the highway so it s great if you want to get out of the city to visit Lake Como or Maggiore both reachable within an hour give or take depending on where you re going Just past the subway station there s a good pizza place and just down the side street from there on the right there s a Carrefour Express a mini supermarket for those who don t know where you can get anything and everything 
488864,Hotel Da Vinci, Hard pillows Distance from metro is more than 10mins Coachloads of tourists converging on the breakfast room all at once was chaotic and and not a pleasant experience as people jostled with one another and staff could not cope with the numbers , The decor is something to behold but I knew that when I booked Chickens in the grounds was also a first for a 4 star hotel Room was excellent along with tv channels 
488865,Hotel Da Vinci, The hotel is located in a suburb very far from the center You need to take a train and a metro , Very easy access when you come to the city by car Excellent parking Nice staff Very good breakfast 
488866,Hotel Da Vinci, The matress is hard and pillows horrible The elevator is too Small Our room has bad smell We asked for more hangers there are only 5 and nobody answer solicitation , Good bathroom and breakfast Free parking
488867,Hotel Da Vinci, In check in at 11pm i told the reception to send someone to help me in the luggage He replied sorry we don t have anyone right now I never heard something like this in my life Especially from 4 stars hotel Three people in reception and no one available to carry the luggage When i went to the room and i tried to switch on the AC but i couldn t I went down to the reception and told them and the lady replied we don t have anyone right now Strange and funny as well Some of The staff in breakfast hall are not professional The issue was because i took 2 sandwiches for my kid They said you are not allowed to do that this is breakfast and call room service if you want to take something to the room The security came as well It was funny for me that all these guys are shouting for taking sandwiches I can bring my kids to breakfast hall But because they were shouting crying and playing all around the day before that i decided to not bring them down Of course i took the sandwiches in the end The hotel is near the station but for me the location is very bad There is no supermarkets or pharmacies near the hotel It is far from everything , Beautiful design The breakfast was very good You have several choices 
488868,Hotel Da Vinci, Mini bar was not well stocked with alcohol or snacks due to our late arrival we were in need of a hot drink but no facilities in the room for this And the bar had closed at midnight , Bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was excellent would recommend this Hotel 
488869,Hotel Da Vinci, It started off a little weird at the check in as the receptionist kept addressing me while asking for my girfriends passport origin even though she was standing right next to me The keycard system didn t work seems to happen quite often but that wasn t a big deal Heading to the room we were wondering if vacuuming the corridor to the rooms isn t a thing there were even some cardboard leftovers laying around Sadly the maintenance of the room decoration doesn t seem to have the highest priority Many of the decoration mirrors were shattered The bathroom was clean but when we arrived there was no soap shower gel or shampoo provided but a shower cap This and the shower floor didn t make a 4 star impression The next day there were sanitary items so it seemed they forgot Breakfast well to be honest I was a bit shocked when we entered the breakfast room on the first morning The typical all inclusive tourist mentality it s free so who cares if i eat it left mountains of untouched food on the tables This is not the hotels fault so you can t blame them that much Probably a tribute to the cheap price In that battlefield it was hard to find a table that was both clean and had cutlery The hotel also has a restaurant we were planning to go there after coming back from the city It turned out to be an all you can eat buffet that night but the restaurant was just occupied by a family with three screaming kids and one guy wearing headphones while having 5 plates in front of him Not what we expected in a 4 star hotel but since we were just 40 minutes before closing time and out of other options nearby we were asking for la carte menu or snacks offered for roomservice too with an extra fee of 10 The waiter who was really friendly told us that they have snacks and pizza at the bar upstairs The bar was another highlight of customer service , We booked a superior double room because we liked the design The room was huge bed very comfortable and clean The style of the hotel itself is nice as well To me the location was really good except if you plan to do things on foot there s not much nearby except some McDonalds But on the other hand there is a big free parking behind the hotel and just a couple of meters away you can find the train station that brings you to the inner city We couldn t hear any noise from the trains in our room If you re looking for a hotel with a good price value free parking a nice room and public transport nearby and don t care about other facilities bar restaurant friendly staff i would recommend it Breakfast selection was ok too 
488870,Hotel Da Vinci, Whilst the price of the rooms was good anything else in the Hotel is ultra expensive We realised this when we had to pay 10 for a toast , Very friendly staff nice design breakfast is OK good value for price rooms are clean 
488871,Hotel Da Vinci, not close to city center if you have your own car no problem dinner was open buffet but not rich enough room service was not responding , very clean and large rooms great breakfast 
488872,Hotel Da Vinci, Nothing at all , Price Performance location free parking wi fi works properly Da Vinci Hotel is my place in Milano pleasure for me to stay everytime I visit Milan Strongly recommend Grace and Stefano nice people 
488873,Hotel Da Vinci, Getting to the parking lot was a little awkward Plus where to load and unload luggage could have been explained better , This place was incredible The staff were personable and checking in was a sinch But let s talk about posh and comfort first The room sizes are adequate and the beds are super comfortable I loved the generous size of the rain shower shower That was the best The closets are enormous there is an in room safe and a cute little refrigerator Breakfast was good and they had plenty of choices for every taste Besides being a funky hotel who wouldn t want to stay in a big purple hotel If it s a big purple hotel you have make it your civic duty to stay there Thanks guys 
488874,Hotel Da Vinci, 2 things the room 806 it was very very noisy as it is the closest room to the elevator which was going up and down the whole night cases a bad noise all the time other than this the room is extremely good the 2nd one the check in was very difficult and tough they only accepted us in until I entreat them all this because we were a family with 3 children one of them is 4 years yes the 3rd child was an extra person but the person at the reception didn t accept to check us in at the beginning and she was about to cancel our booking after all discussion they accepted us and they charged me 50 Euro per night for him while the room was so big to have him using the same bedding without any issue for us or for them , the room size was great location is good for people who has cars parking was excellent 
488875,Hotel Da Vinci, To be honest the only weak point that didn t affect me in this occasion of this hotel is that you need to have a car due to the location quite far from the Milan downtown The rest is perfect And on the opposite if you have a car this is the perfect location to park the car for free in a very large parking , This hotel saved me when I moved in after a bad experience in another one in the same town The Da Vinci hotel surprised positively me with a very cosy but large room Big and nice bathroom Very good breakfast Nice bar Very confortable bed Very big and free parking Excellent ratio quality price 
488876,Hotel Da Vinci, the hotel has a good price so you will see many tourist group at the breakfast time , first of all the place is not easy to find and if you drive car you cannot drive in from the main entrance there is another entrance for parking lot from behind The location is actually very very great since the train station is just beside the parking lot Train to city center is available every half an hour only 15 minutes with 4 stops We ve got very helpful information from staffs Room is spacious with a super big balcony anyway there is no great views out there 
488877,Hotel Da Vinci, Location seems a bit out of the way and is located in the middle of what seemed like a residential area lots of flats , We had 2 triple rooms Amazing decor great sized rooms very modern and clean Friendly staff and huge breakfast dining area Huge parking space at the back of the hotel Nice Bar and lots of lifts Good choice at breakfast and plenty to go around with so many people 
488878,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Very nice and modern hotel Modern design rooms price is good for 4 hotel The room was quiet and clean The groundfloor design is modern The bar staff friendly and thanks for the strong coctail guys D The breakfast wast nice lots of choice and enough The metro stration is cca 10 min by walk Free parking and free wifi Thank you 
488879,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, amazing design very clean rooms we stayed one night with our 3 yrs old daughter and we was upgraded to junior suite the breakfast is good very good choice close to metro station 7min walk Good value for your money
488880,Hotel Da Vinci, The location is awful The main building is flanked by two derelict buildings and the further surrounding area feels like an unpleasant area Nothing to do in the local area either bar walk around the near by Park but if you re alone I couldn t recommend as a safe trip Also lack of vending machines , Hotel was nice and quirky Got a free upgrade to junior suite which was very clean and well kitted out room Good breakfast dinner selection 
488881,Hotel Da Vinci, Staff were very rude The hotel is a drive from the city centre and is hard to find even with gps it is in the middle of houses which looks odd there is construction going on too on site , The hotel is very modern which we loved Decor was on point felt cosy in our room and had free wifi all round the hotel Beautiful looking hotel with stunning rooms 
488882,Hotel Da Vinci, The receptionist NICOLO was totally RUDE to us every time we asked for something , We has a free upgrade to a superior room Free parking Good breakfast
488883,Hotel Da Vinci, Difficult to find hotel parking very simple breakfast difficult to move with the baby on stroller stairs from parking and small lift , Reasonable price big rooms close to train station if you want to visit Milan friendly staff
488884,Hotel Da Vinci, The location is a bit far from the center, Everything was special starting with the colours and decoration and ending with the rooms I recommend all to visit it
488885,Hotel Da Vinci, No fitness no spa Compared to a BnB hotel the breakfast is good but compared to a 3 star average otel it is normal breakfast nothing continental or great about it Rooms are not soundproofed I can hear average to loud talking from both walls of my room Although I hanged the do not disturb sign on my door my room was entered and cleaned After warning the reception about this and having them take a note and promise that it will not happen again IT DID HAPPEN AGAIN THE NEXT DAY My room was again entered and made up What kind of approach to privacy and customer request is this What is the problem I will talk to the manager on my checkout if this time what they said is true Not recommending this hotel to anyone Last but not least it specifically states soundproofing on booking com and fitness here on Google but both of them DON T EXIST Breakfast is regular for me not continental as stated on booking WiFi is provided but slow and unstable , At least the rooms are big cozy and they seem clean However this was last of my concerns 
488886,Hotel Da Vinci, The surroundings are really scary some abandoned buildings It is actually in some suburb area Some simple things were missing like extra pillows only two towels while we were 4 persons , Spacious room well decorated The breakfast was also fine good connection with the subway it is 900 meters walking from the hotel and in 15 min it takes you right to the center Duomo piazza 
488887,Hotel Da Vinci, Design of the hotel is not the strong side It is intentionally too much Neighbourhood is a bit spooky since the hotel is between two abandoned buildings but itself is very good Local signs to the hotel are not existing , Good value very good cleanliness and comfort Very good breakfast Close to the train station for going to centre 
488888,Hotel Da Vinci, Nothing, Very comfortable room nice and modern furniture Perfect connection to the city centre via train station close to the hotel train runs every 30 min Fair wifi Amazing breakfast 
488889,Hotel Da Vinci, we saw ants in the bathroom could not switch off air exhausting device in the bathroom it was making noise the wardrobe could be only opened to half no kitchen facilities it was a standard room but we expected at least a kettle and glasses we got only two plastic ones roosters in the hotel park they were making terrible noise each morning since 5 AM , location was fine even though not very close to the centre but there is train station right next to the hotel you can get off on the next stop and take the metro bed was comfortable
488890,Hotel Da Vinci, Placing a budget buffet restaurant makes this place a 4 Star You can expect to be underwhelmed from the slow lifts uncomfortable beds poorly furnished to the cafeteria style breakfast TIP if you do stay ask the waiter for a coffee and you will be presented with a great coffee as opposed to the self serve machine On our 3rd day we were asked to move rooms as the one we were in needed repairs to the A C This would have been okay if they had a room to put us in but they asked us to vacate the room while we waited for another room to become available District is a bit derelict surrounded by two skeletons of buildings either side Photos are not representative of rooms , Staff are great overworked and way understaffed
488891,Hotel Da Vinci, 1 Far from Metro location may be conplicated for travellers w o car with significant luggage, 1 Nice hotel in green area 2 Strong Wifi 3 Good room
488892,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Nice clean and spacious room and a very nice abundant breakfast Good location ca 10 min walk to the metro station Free parking Friendly staff 
488893,Hotel Da Vinci, When i want enter from the front door by my car at the first time it was not nice how the security guy treat us Should be some one who can talking english to stay there to explain where we can park our car, How its clean not costly and comfortable 
488894,Hotel Da Vinci, No coffee or tea facilities in the rooms Would benefit with a small gym workout room , Super big room Bed was huge Bathroom and facilities very clean Breakfast was brilliant with plenty of choice Location very good in a quiet area with rail on the doorstep and subway only a short walk 
488895,Hotel Da Vinci, Cockerel all night long in the grounds Bad air con not very cool Shower didn t run away well was like a paddling pool Staff entering room without knocking while we were asleep , Nice bathroom products 
488896,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Lovely hotel just in wrong location Too far from comasina metro and no easy way to get a taxi at that station Also spoilt somewhat by 2 unsightly abandoned apartment blocks either side Breakfast ok but staff too quick to remove breakfast items before official finish time 
488897,Hotel Da Vinci, we booked the SUITE realty of the room is very different from the pictures on website our shower had problems for our entire duration of hot water coming and going to a point that you couldn t take a shower doing that with 3 kids was very hard , breakfast was excelent
488898,Hotel Da Vinci, Very disappointed with the food for both breakfast and dinner as everything even though on warming plates was cold and it was like eating in a school canteen, The staff were extremely helpful and very friendly The room were beautiful and very spacious
488899,Hotel Da Vinci, If you accidentally droped some food on the ground the ants there would be more than happy to get rid of it One night while sleeping in a room on the 7th floor we ve heard the water running so that we thought it was from our Bathroom apparently it was from a neighbouring room that the people there were taking a shower , Big rooms big bathrooms various satellite channels 
488900,Hotel Da Vinci, A little bit far away from the centre but with subway you are there in 20 25 minutes I didn t liked that one day when we came home in the evening the bathroom sink was full of water Probably when they made the cleaning something happened but is unnaceptabe for a 4 star hotel , The breakfast is very good room quite ok and big enough for a family with 2 children 
488901,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast was like feeding time the zoo children running around dogs barking as the hotel allows animals to stay at the hotel Good ran out and it took forever to get more tables weren t being cleared quickly enough crockery took forever to be replenished so there was always queue for everything , Hotel was clean 
488902,Hotel Da Vinci, Nothing , We absolutely loved this hotel The room was beautiful lots of space and clean The hotel was quirky and fun full of colour Staff were very friendly and the breakfast was fantastic with a great variety to choose from Will defiantly be back on our next trip to Milan 
488903,Hotel Da Vinci, not a great deal to entertain oneself the food was very expensive and poor quality the bar area was tidy but often having to wait for service , the rooms were spacious and clean the grounds were secure and tidy 
488904,Hotel Da Vinci, Strange location in between part built derelict buildings On it s own compound with a gatehouse Near high rise blocks of flats 15 20 minute walk from metro station No signposts from station , Friendly staff Clean rooms Breakfast buffet was good Value for money 
488905,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast was very disappointing Was included in the price but VERY limited Then they had the cheek to charge 4 for a slice of toast , Friendly staff room was fine for what we needed landed too late to get the hire car and move on to our destination 
488906,Hotel Da Vinci, bit of a rough looking neighbourhood only stayed 1 night as traveling nearest restaurants a few miles away so decided to eat at the hotel buffet our biggest mistake of our holiday also had issue no wifi connection in room , close to the motorway and car park resonably priced 
488907,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Except for the location everything was great Location is only inconvenient because the nearest train station is the suburban train line and the trains only come once in half an hour It took us a long time to get to the center Facilities and staff are all great I d recommend this hotel to travellers who do not have to depend on public transportation 
488908,Hotel Da Vinci, The place is quite off the centre of Milan It it a very big hotel that has an air of a youth hostel in the lobby crowded during the breakfast and check in check out time The hotel is apparently understaffed for its size, the room was very spacious and nicely decorated Good choice of breakfast options free parking available
488909,Hotel Da Vinci, Stuff in Reception is VERY Rude BAD UNSAFE parkings AREA My car window got broken and Most of things in the Car were stolen When I report the issue to the Hotel management they said we are not responsible Worst experience EVER I DON T Recommend this hotel to any body Pay more and stay safe , The only thing I liked is the value of many 
488910,Hotel Da Vinci, You could hear alot of noise from the other rooms and hallways, The hotel was great value Only a few stops on the train into centre of Milan The staff were very friendly and helpful The breakfast buffet was fantastic Had everything you needed
488911,Hotel Da Vinci, no nearby places to eat need to make sure you have dinner before returning to hotel at night have only a buffet at the hotel that did not appeal to our tastes long walk to subway, great for families with cars spacious modern rooms
488912,Hotel Da Vinci, Problems communicating in english the bed was very uncomfortable Breakfast was very poor Not recommendable for families I couldnt understand how this hotel received high ratings Those who voted possitively must have stayed somewhere much worse , Nothing likeable just clean facility 
488913,Hotel Da Vinci, The reception is very crowded and you have to wait several minutes to check in out, Huge room and one of the most comfortable bed ever Free parking good breakfast Easy to get to downtown
488914,Hotel Da Vinci, it s very difficult to find because in the middle of block of lfats and full with one way road Ask somebody to help if you dont t want to some circle the walls are very thin you hear every noise from corricor other room, king size bed great choice of breakfast nice modern design
488915,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast time was manic Too many people not enough seats or staff food kept running out and had to wait 20mins for more eggs Other than looking nice the hotel had nothing else to offer No pool gym outdoor activities games room etc , The room and hotel were really well decorated lovely big bed and massive shower Art deco was fab throughout Free parking and close to train station into town 
488916,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast was not sufficient services were poor no any amenities inside the room no iron box hot water kettle A four start not having any complimentary of water tea coffee in the room Certainly need to improve, The rooms are spacious
488917,Hotel Da Vinci, Distance to metro station walkable but not as close as we thought originally and returning to hotel at night through deserted roads felt uneasy , Clean hotel modern and spacious rooms nicely decorated good breakfast bar 
488918,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Great hotel would definitely recommend Right next to the train station easy access to the centre of Milan Beautiful city and hotel Breakfast has a good variety 
488919,Hotel Da Vinci, The staff were not cooperating when asked to have adjacent rooms ended in 6th floor and kinds in 1st I asked for late check out 2 hours was given 1 only and asked to pay 30 Euros for the additional hour The hotel is located too far from the center of Milan and the nearest subway station is about1 km from the hotel , The rooms were clean Free car park Buffet type breakfast 
488920,Hotel Da Vinci, Room was not sound proof although it says on the description that it was We got woken op by the guests in the room next to us who were having a huge fight, Room was really clean and we had one with a balcony Staff were friendly Dinner was really good
488921,Hotel Da Vinci, Huge delay for checking in and told me had to go to Milan or sit around for a few hours Stressed and rude front desk staff the no electric in room then when we finally got in Overpriced food and the breakfast was very poor Would never go back and we checked out a day early , The decour was quirky The man who came to fix our electric was lovely 
488922,Hotel Da Vinci, The hotel was not clean at all they don t clean the bathroom very well also they didn t provide the shower gel and shampoo Very far from everything Nothing around it no supermarket or shopping You have to take taxis which were very expensive I don t advise any one to book there, The staff were helpful
488923,Hotel Da Vinci, It s very far from the city center and even from the nearest metro station They lie about every single distance time in fact it s further than advertised The wifi wasn t working properly I had to use roaming 3g instead The sound isolation is bad I could clearly hear children running in the room above mine Won t recommend ,No Positive
488924,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast was always busy and not sufficient enough tables wrong size spoons table spoons used for cereals Overcrowded and staff not friendly Terrible experience No tea or coffee facilities provided in the room Not a 4 hotel it should be rated as 3 ,No Positive
488925,Hotel Da Vinci, Check in was bad and check out take much longer time i found some insect in the room Elevator takes long time and breakfast area was crowded and not orgenized well , Only the design and decoration of the hotel
488926,Hotel Da Vinci, City tax should be considered while booking because it is too high , Breakfast is quite rich it is not easy to find such breakfast in Italy The room was comfortable
488927,Hotel Da Vinci, Unfriendly personnel bad organization in hotel Breakfast room and organization a disaster Rather bad location for anything to do in Milano , Rooms are OK
488928,Hotel Da Vinci, Location was a bit far out from city and the area around the hotel was very much deserted with unfinished buildings and unoccupied office blocks , WIFI was excellent and the price was very fair The hotel was also very modern
488929,Hotel Da Vinci, 1 There wasn t enough light in the room 2 They didn t inform us in advance about the 200 euro guaranty we had to pay at the check in 3 Although we put at the door do not disturb sign they didn t respect this , The king size bed was very comfortable 
488930,Hotel Da Vinci, 1 Terrible location 2 Unwelcoming Rude staff and unattending 3 No concierge to help 4 Terrible breakfast 5 We requested a simple things like adapter or an extra blanket they couldn t provide us with 6 Most importantly the play with CRIDET CARD TRANSACTIONS Occording to the receptionist it is standard procedure to block random amounts of money on DAILY basis 7 Key cards jam all the time i e U can t access your room 8 Furniture on the web looks much fancier than in reality 9 No restaurant or propper menus to order from for room service so forget in room dinning 10 Not family friendly as they don t provide connecting or near by rooms My kids had to stay in a different floor 11 Flying bugs in the room, Nothing at all 
488931,Hotel Da Vinci, I was slightly disappointed with breakfast cold eggs and there was no coffee cups for a long time, Very friendly staff clean and comfy room free parking Hotel is very tastefully furnished 
488932,Hotel Da Vinci, as far as i could aknowledge from my experiente the clients that have booked through Booking are given room less prepared efficient than the rest We were given the room 141 and when i took a shower no longer than 5 to 10minutes long since we were going to dinner i had a swimming pool Water all Over the bathroom and already going to the room I ve called the reception and they immediatly told me that they would send maintenance and at the same time without me asking told me that the hotel was full I ve received myself the maintenance and explain what happened as if i was representing my own home the maintenance guys were very kind and told me that the repair would take 45 to 60m long to handle I ve called the reception saying that my husband needed to have a bath so that we could leave for dinner already around 21h the lady in the reception told me AGAIN that the hotel was full I ve answered that i had nothing to do with that i just neeeded a resolution S Magic happened and a room appeared free on the 2 floor When i ve entered the new room i ve understood that the new room had the amenities that anyone expects in a 4 stars hotel like the soap and shampoo sily things but that make part of any 4 stars hotel experiente So i had the impression that Booking com clients are diferentiated Had the impression that they were expecting that i would not complain about the malfonction of the room bathroom i was not very happy I dos not notice any advantage in being a genius hotel , The hotel itself it s very original and has good conditions BUT continues in not so good feedback 
488933,Hotel Da Vinci, Room service is coming before 10 00 Don t forget to put don t disturb on the door , With public transportation 20 min to the city center Very clean and big rooms We will surely stay next time there again Price is reasonable 
488934,Hotel Da Vinci, Roosters in the courtyard of the hotel And they screaming in the middle of the night One day they started at two o clock in the morning I could not sleep because of the noise roosters , Everything else was great 
488935,Hotel Da Vinci, Located outside of Milan Breakfast was very busy , A modern hotel with the wow factor lots of art work and interesting unusual designs The bedroom was very comfy and decorated to an high standard A massive car park which is secured by a gate The evening buffet is excellent value and included an whole salmon which was delicious The staff on reception were very helpful particularly Stepho 
488936,Hotel Da Vinci, location is very far away from central milan although theres a train station next door Had more of a family environment feel not so romantic for young couples , Breakfast was huge superior room was very very big and spacious love the shower 
488937,Hotel Da Vinci, They hold some amount from my card and they said they will release it with in 3 days but untill now nothing going with that And they didn t reply my email , It was a great staying I recommend it
488938,Hotel Da Vinci, Way treated by staff at hotel, Had to pay higher price than quoted also spent first night sleeping outside Milan airport with my 15 year old daughter because did not provide transport to hotel from airport still charged for first night very disappointed never go Milan again 
488939,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, We liked everything Interior was fantastic very comfortable and spacious room big king size bedroom beautiful view from 6th floor breakfast was very very good a large selection of food and it was delicious Near is Comasina metro 1 km walk a big free parking 
488940,Hotel Da Vinci, Swimming pool is missing, This was our second stay in this hotel Location is perfect Rooms are nice Staff is friendly and professional Walking distance to public transport nice and clean hotel 
488941,Hotel Da Vinci, if i was to say anything it would be that you have to wait a good few minutes for the lift when the hotel is busy but that is a good excuse for a bit of exercise and to use the stairs , The hotel was beautiful The rooms are huge and really nicely decorated The bed is also huge and comfy The restaurant served a really nice buffet It has a good car park which is really important to us 
488942,Hotel Da Vinci, Not so soundproof rooms from door side Breakfast can be a mess due to huge amount of guests Avoid after 9am as you wont find seating in the main room and might wait for having food of your liking if you are vegetarian as fruits and veggies are limited Eggs scrambled are more than enough with all sausages and bacon cakes etc Fresh fruits limited healthy alternatives also limited If vegan vegetarian check if anything changed but dont expect much Staff are assisting but limited in the breakfast time and can be frustrating to both them and guests , Quiet Location free parking big rooms great dinner buffet with great vegan vegetarian options Finally a working WiFi Kind staff
488943,Hotel Da Vinci, The reception staff so rude I pay extra 60 for the supplement of my 5 year old daughter because of the Italian law the staff insist me to pay this Does he think my 5 years old daughter can cost 60 for the breakfast It s 4 Star hotel but the room no kettle that can have a tea or coffee , Nothing
488944,Hotel Da Vinci, Hotel receptionists always seem jaded on arrival and on leaving they never seem very happy and greetings are always matter of fact not really welcoming and when you leave they say have a good trip but it doesn t sound as though they mean it A smile goes a long way but they do not smile , The Da Vinci has changed since our first visit in 2013 It seems to me they have made cost cutting exercises in all their departments to keep their prices competitive although the rooms are still excellent in quality and the towels are plentiful The restaurant has changed its menu you can now eat from a buffet for a fixed price which means they have cut their waiting staff Breakfast is still as good as it always was and the waiting staff give an excellent service 
488945,Hotel Da Vinci, Location is a bit too far out and surrounded by derelict apartment blocks Long queue for check in bar prices a little expensive and not sure how this happened but somebody had access to our room while we were asleep at 1am The door opened and somebody entered the room We did inform the staff the next day who apologised A nice hotel that has a lot of potential but doesn t use it , The room was nice comfortable and clean Breakfast was good too 
488946,Hotel Da Vinci, The breakfast had alot of variety but tasted unproffesionaly awful It was very crowded and we always had difficulty in finding a table since it was an all you can eat buffet The food and the crowded place had a very bad smell due to the congestion of people The location was very hard to find It was between buildings and the entrance was extremely hard to find The picture taken as the front of the building is not what you will see in real life so don t depend on the picture The front is covered with buildings and trees The rooms had no facilities what so ever not even a coffee maker The elevator took forever to reach any floor we were on the 8th where we eventually took the stairs to go down and painfully waited for the elevator to go up Their pillows were almost non existant I hated them , The funny mirror on floor 1 was really fun it made you look like a dwarf The rooms were spacious and very clean i liked the every day cleaning because you don t find that in europe The employees were very friendly and very polite 
488947,Hotel Da Vinci, I didn t like that many guests are waisting food at breakfast Dear guests please only take the food that you are planning to eat Do not take 10 slices of bread and 10 sausages if you are only going to eat 2 of each I know breakfast is included but that s no excuse for taking food that you re NOT going to eat It s too crowded at breakfast We have to wait till there is a table free The hotel is not ecological minded There is no need to change the towels every day There are no facilities in the bathroom to hang up our towels We hung up the towels in the closet but they are still changed Children were playing in the hallway very late after midnight and in the morning our neighbors put on their music on very loud with their doors open The hotel should inform the guests that they should mind the other guests At all other hotels in Italy we only have to pay the hotel room after checking out At this hotel we either have to pay the whole bill at checking in or they will pre authorize my credit card I chose for pre authorization of my card Now they ve made a reservation of 105 euro on my card And they have not cancelled that yet , Breakfast is good 
488948,Hotel Da Vinci, Needless check in time wasted and lots of firms to sign due to tax implications just delayed check in Check out saw us queue just to get the money back from check in Money was taken in case we used the mini bar No trust there at all Breakfast was so busy the room wasn t big enough and we spilled over in to the main dining room , Large breakfast selection
488949,Hotel Da Vinci, Lifts were a bit slow , The hotel was conveniently located Staff were very helpful and accommodating Breakfast was gorgeous and added to the pleasure 
488950,Hotel Da Vinci, There was poor lighting in the room and we requested a kettle and the kettle was never brought to our room , Breakfast was quite abundant and very good The hotel had a beautiful and unique interior design 
488951,Hotel Da Vinci, 1 The hotel is full of mosquitos which disturbed us and my kids during the sleep and left us with bite marks 2 the breakfast restaurant was like a zoo because of messy crowdness i spent two morning eating my food while standing ,No Positive
488952,Hotel Da Vinci, The check in after a 9 hour flight took 2 1 2 hours Shower had no ventilation no blinds on the window the breakfast was a disaster every day The food was terrible and I mean terrible The elevators fit three ppl with medium sized suitcases and take 20 minutes to show up and are always packed with other people The hotel is surrounded by two abandoned buildings which makes it feel very unsafe , Bedrooms were nice beds were more on the firm side and pillows were terrible and un supportive 
488953,Hotel Da Vinci, Restaurant was very poor quality and lounge just served chips There far too many very good Hotels to stay at than this one , Breakfast was Okay Restaurant was total loss and no other place to eat 
488954,Hotel Da Vinci, The room was too hot we called the staff to come and check they said they couldnt do it and they didn t offer to change our room I believe this made our stay very uncomfortable , The bit that I liked was that the location of the hotel was close to the train station
488955,Hotel Da Vinci, Staff s not fully trained not sure what they doing check in and out took very long have to wait 30 mins que was very long , Beautiful bulding and lobby rooms 
488956,Hotel Da Vinci, Staff were grumpy and not helpful I requested early check in which they agreed through booking com by when I reach My request was totally ignored and made me come after2 30 The sink in the room broke so I was moved inconveniently to another room Very bad experience,No Positive
488957,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast space is far too small for the number of guests We had to go back and forth with our plates tea and juices from the breakfast room to the restaurant where we were seated as there was no space Long check in and check out queues Room doors are difficult to close so most of the guests were slamming them , Big modern rooms Staff at the reception desk was very nice Very conveniently located next to the train station We took the S4 train and reached Milan city centre in 15 min you can use the same ticket for the metro and the price is the same as it is in the urban zone 
488958,Hotel Da Vinci, Location is too far from the city center The hotel located at the outskirts of Milano , The room was quite large clean and comfortable Breakfast was good You can use Comasina metro station to reach city center 
488959,Hotel Da Vinci, The location is surrounded by two abandoned apartment buildings which can look a bit eerie , The breakfast was excellent A very large variety to chose from The room was very big with a huge bed The parking facility is gated with video surveillace large and free Acces from the motorway is very easy 
488960,Hotel Da Vinci, We asked for superior room what they do not tell you in the small print is that this means you are put amongst the large family groups who have up to six seven people in their rooms this is in the first and second floors stick to a double nothing special about the rooms as for breakfast what a mess not enough tables for the very large family groups staying there not enough plates thought I was back at school not a four star hotel Dogs in dining room, Free Parking
488961,Hotel Da Vinci, Crowded restaurant every morning had to stand and wait for a table There were not enough clean cups for tea and coffe guests had to use bowls or plastic glasses Plastic glasses were also in the room Nowhere to hang a towel in the bathroom Shower facilities were not convenient , Good parking access to train station 
488962,Hotel Da Vinci, The two abandoned buildings next to the hotel made the area look shady Parking lot could use with some TLC and more protected spots Breakfast room is too small for the dimension of the hotel and the quality of the food is not the best The pillows are quite hard Decor of the hotel not to my taste and rooms could do with better soundproofing, Staff was overall very friendly Hotel is well kept Nice dinner buffet at a reasonable price Quite close to the city center by car and train station next door Being woken up by roosters just like in the country 
488963,Hotel Da Vinci, Loooong queue at check in An impression of hidden dirt Hotel looks more like a student rez In the dirty corridors there was a smell of cooking a bad smell rather then appetising Smelly mattress and pillows musty Soundproofing between rooms nonexistent as we had to listen to the couple next door copulating which for a family with young children was unacceptable My kids were asking me why was the man beating the woman and she was shouting You could also hear kids running up and down the corridors till midnight as the doors were also inadequate Breakfast was as if in a pigsty Everything was unhealthy and artificial juices cakes rotten fruit The hotel is set in a area with abandoned buildings railway lines and the view from the window was onto a construction site The neighbourhood was littered and dirty and far from anything and everything The entrance to the hotel from the parking lot is down steep stairs and no assistance to help with luggage or ramp It was funny to watch people struggling up these stairs with their luggage It is a joke that this hotel has 4 stars Someone should investigate it If you think that I must be exaggerating then spend a night there and , Nothing
488964,Hotel Da Vinci, Suprise to see some chicken raised in the front garden Funny that those chicken singing woke us early morning Checkin process is quite complicated We waited about an hour in a queue Breakfast has a lot of choice but not very tasty Unfinished building on the left and right which looks old and horrible , spaceful room very good decoration a lot of choice on TV Big free parking at the back yard Good price as a 4 star hotel 
488965,Hotel Da Vinci, A lot of people in the breakfast but I think that was for the season , The design was perfect Very beautiful everything nice The rooms are very big comfortables beds very clean the breakfast was good Everything perfect You have to walk like 10 min to the subway but it s in the same direction to the Duomo so you are in the town in 20 min 
488966,Hotel Da Vinci, the room size bed and tv don t meet a four stars hotel requirement, Although the property lot is compact in width yet the total ambiance such as furnishings and employees give the feeling of the good old times when hotels used to be considered as home living
488967,Hotel Da Vinci, Too far away from the city center Not enough parking lots for this amount of guests , The Hotel is nice and clean and has a friendly Staff Big comfortable and soundproofed room Good breakfast 
488968,Hotel Da Vinci, Not enough bar staff or seating at the bar it was a big hotel and did not cater for the amount of guests the bar staff were it appeared inexperienced, Quirky hotel food good ate in the hotel restaurant room was lovely great value for money 
488969,Hotel Da Vinci, Metro is little bit far away not really a fun when you have to walk when 40 degrees is outside Waiting to check in at the reception around 45min , Big room free parking security breakfast was okay 
488970,Hotel Da Vinci, Careful cropping of the external photos disguises the fact that the hotel is sandwiched between two enormous 10 storey derelict apartment blocks which look like they belong in the nuclear fallout zone around Pripyat Whole surrounding area is pretty sketchy mixture of rundown residential blocks and railway yards Many staff seem disgruntled and appear to resent dealing with customers especially the inappropriately named Grace on the reception desk Rudely shouting at a long queue of customers who are collectively demonstrating more patience and courtesy than the staff actually warrant is seldom a good move , The room provided was clean modern and quite a bit bigger than average Generously sized outdoor parking at no extra cost Looked like they d made a genuine effort to make the place presentable and inviting Excellent WiFi Good value at the price offered on Booking com 
488971,Hotel Da Vinci, Away from Station direction given by telestaff misleading it s almost a kilometer away from nearest metro station, facilities were good quality food
488972,Hotel Da Vinci, I reserved a superior room for about 100EUR whisch is a good price and the hotel hold 100 euro temporary block on my credit card however the room was paid in advance The reason was the minibar but I think not correct to block 100EUR for the minibar which is equal to thge price of the room I think it is not correct to block money and it was not descriebed on the booking com site The nearest metro Comasina is 15 20 mins walk away and the area is desolate We didn t find any restaurant at the area of the metro station except of a McDonalds No new shower gel on the second day We had take away breakfast but it was REALLY poor in contrast the buffet breakfast The early check in was not available I am genius member on booking com and it was free for me Room service and bar is costly You have to calculate with the city tax , We liked the king size bed and the breakfast The room was beautiful however the colours were not as beautiful as in the picture and the mirror was broken Price is reasonable 
488973,Hotel Da Vinci, Location was a bit farther from main attractions but I always enjoyed staying a distance away from the city center just so I can enjoy the scenery and adventure on the way to these attractions , Very friendly staff excellent service Amazing complementary continental style breakfast You can also enjoy aperativos at the hotel bar if you wish to stay in The artwork in the lobby is great to admire as well 
488974,Hotel Da Vinci, crowded breakfast restaurant far from center, Big hotel free parking lot nice and clean room modern design Metro station 10 minutes waking bus stop 5 min walking and train stop 2 3 min walking
488975,Hotel Da Vinci, Had to queue for 40 minutes to check in due to lack of staff Quite annoying after a long day on the road Free wi fi never worked , Spacious comfortable room for a family of 4 
488976,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Excellent value for money great breakfast included in the price and free parking The area is outskirts of the city but there is metro station which takes you directly to the centre in 20 mins Great for city break or a stop over for a night or two
488977,Hotel Da Vinci, Milan city tax the use of material for this hotel that could be really hot , It is close to Milan and right for an intermediate stop rooms are nice and good 
488978,Hotel Da Vinci, Waiting for 5 hours in reception upon arrival after 24 hour flight and transfers from the airport as apparently no room was ready at 10am Hotel surroundings were disappointing with stripped down abandoned building complexes on either side , Excellent Breakfast and internet
488979,Hotel Da Vinci, The fact it took 20 minutes and a screed of paperwork to stay for one night The fact that at midnight when my kids were asleep the bathroom sink decided to fall through the marble plinth to the floor sending water everywhere Thus having to wake the kids to a different room then getting woken again by a cleaner or someone entering our room at about 7 30 in the morning , Breakfast
488980,Hotel Da Vinci, This is definitely NOT a 4 hotel Well design room and the hall is not enough Room was not very clean you could find dead insects on the walls Bed lining had holes no slippers in the room Bathroom ceiling needed repairment , Free parking good room service and nice food from the restaurant

488990,Hotel Da Vinci, Bathroom had an awful smell during all our stay Few ants where walking in our room too Restaurant food had huge variety but no flavor what so ever Ugly empty buildings in the area , Breakfast had big variety but the flavor of it was average Good price and close to metro station only 7mins away Free and easy parking to access 
488991,Hotel Da Vinci, No pool, I would like to thank the front desk Francesca because she has the ability to solve all the problems and deal with high professional costumer service 
488992,Hotel Da Vinci, The WiFi was very slow At least one or the coffee machine always broke each morning They did not let us check in early even if genius members shall be able to check in 2 hours before , We managed to get 50 discount deal while booking 
488993,Hotel Da Vinci, The area of the hotel is like a ghetto which you do not see from the pictures but the hotel is secure and guarded so we still felt safe Just be mindful of this if you are planning to walk to and from the hotel and the metro etc , The breakfast was nice and Stefano at the front desk was pleasant 
488994,Hotel Da Vinci, The breakfast room was absolutely full and not a single space where to sit , Nice room and hotel great position and staff very helpful The cocktail bar is great

489013,Hotel Da Vinci, the breakfast hall is a disaster like a zoo the staff do their best for refilling stations and cleaning and clearing tables but the sheer volume of people is overwhelming no matter when you come down the place is heaving and there is nowhere to sit in peace and have breakfast the space is too small it should be twice the size for the amount of guests , it is a fairly new hotel and as such is good the rooms are a very good size the beds are large and there is plenty of room for everything large shower and bathroom 
489014,Hotel Da Vinci, Ghost abandoned buildings on both sides of the hotel decor has more in common with Salvador Dali than Leonardo Da Vinci looks like staff is constantly in training It took 20 min to check in I almost had to write an essay with info for two generation back in order not to pay city tourist tax for my children who are exempt from paying tax They had a passports with birthday dates in them and were asking me if they were under 18 years old Maybe it is bureaucratic requirement but filling whole page info sheet not to pay 5 is an overkill it should be automatic since they require a passport to register all guests , Good value for the money Good breakfast clean spacious rooms huge beds Right next to train Metro station 20 minutes to Milan center with one easy transfer from train to Metro If you are in Milan only for a day or passing by it is a good choice and good value Free parking for those who travel by car through Milan to another destination is also a plus

489016,Hotel Da Vinci, Just some words of caution Late night trains to some destinations are usually replaced by night buses Also it s incredibly difficult to work out your train to Brussano even during the day when travelling from Milan unless you find an English speaking member of staff My son and I could have ended up stranded in Comasino at 1 30 in the morning but for a friendly neighbourhood officer of La Polizia Locale who taxied us back to the Da Vinci Hotel , Funky hotel great view out across Milan from our 7th floor balcony spacious cool rooms and very comfortable beds lovely bathroom great inclusive breakfast friendly helpful staff my teenage daughter needed a college assignment printed out for me to erm proofread before submission and desk staff accessed my email account printed out the 60 page document and did it all for nothing more than a heartfelt Grazie mille With the Brussano mainline F S stazione right next door coupled to Milano s superb public transport system the city is very easily opened up But see proviso in the What I didn t like section nothing about the hotel I ve booked for next year rather a word or two of caution about late night travellling Was in Milan for the Bruce Springsteen concert Getting there to the San Siro stadium was simplicity itself Getting back to hotel A wee bit more difficult And some tips Go see The Duomo the Castel and the park drink in the cafe culture from the piazza Duomo and pay a 10 euro premium for a beer but wander two streets away from the main drag and grab a happy hour buffet all you can eat plus a birra media for 5 euro at a funky little ristorante in the arcade on Via Marconi Oh and cocktails on the 10th floor roof top terace of The Square Duomo Hotel on Via Albricchi at its junction with Via Manzini is well worth the 15 euros Chilled out club music in the afternoons dinner 6 30 till 9 30pm accompanied by jazz 
489017,Hotel Da Vinci, The breakfast itself was amazing but the structure the room where it was served was too small for the amount of people what generated an agitated and caothic place , Price

489028,Hotel Da Vinci, nothing , Clean modern room The breakfast was perfect Friendly helpful staff The train station is next to the hotel it is easily to go to the center 
489029,Hotel Da Vinci, The breakfast room was like a school canteen noisy messy and packed The food took ages to be replenished once it had run out Certainly not the most relaxing start to the day A coach load of school children were staying on our floor and thought it was fun to run up and down the corridors banging on each others doors until midnight when we finally complained not so great when you have an early flight the next day We slept each night but didn t wake up refreshed the beds were weirdly uncomfortable having just one flat pillow each didn t help It was a 15 minute walk to the Metro fine during daylight hours but I suspect slightly dodgy after dark the walk takes you past derelict multi storey car parks and buildings The shower didn t drain away and you were soon standing in a paddling pool of water which you had to be careful not to flood the bathroom with , This was one of the cheaper hotels in Milan We booked a junior suite which was a good size for us and our 2 teenagers The big car park out the back with steps leading down to the hotel was handy We would have liked a ramp for the heavy suitcases though The parts of the hotel we used were modern but not in a comfortable way 
489030,Hotel Da Vinci, It was slightly far away from town making it difficult to find something to eat when arriving late The chicken burger at the bar was inedible , The breakfast was excellent and there was plenty of secure parking The hotel was very clean and the room junior suite was comfortable 
489031,Hotel Da Vinci, We had our personal car If someone doesn t have car it little far from the city center, Best value for the price Good and complete breakfast Big rooms Parking
489032,Hotel Da Vinci, Getting bothered 3 times for having our tv too loud when it was off the whole time crappy overpriced restaraunt bleak and unwelcoming room , Great breakfast nice location
489033,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast is poor and the staff are not that friendly Some people were making noise in the next room and the receptionists thought that i am with them and treated me in disrespectful manner I had to wait 3 hours to get the iron , The room are clean and beautiful The wireless connection is fast and reliable Good parking slots 
489034,Hotel Da Vinci, Restaurant is crowded Wi fi is poor The area of the hotel is under construction now which makes noise , Location is fine right next to a railway station 15 min travelling to the city center Good breakfast There are rooms for family 
489035,Hotel Da Vinci, the public transport 700 m walking there was a bus closer half finished building in both sides like a ghost castle, nice sourroundings price breakfast
489036,Hotel Da Vinci, But breakfast must be better, Good Hotel All personel trying to help you and keep you satisfied All know English Thanks Cladio to explain most of the details for city trip 
489037,Hotel Da Vinci, Even though we had booked the room months in advance and made it clear that we would be travelling with a small baby we were put in a room 814 next to the elevators and I assume all the mechanical parts as this was the top floor And they were really loud with all four of them travelling mostly throughout the night I don t quite get how this room and perhaps the other ones close to elevators have the right to exist at all in a 4 stars hotel The lady on the reception only agreed to move us next day so this was a night of a bad sleep resulting in a headache When we came to the reception desk next morning the ladies there were chatting between themselves as if the queue in front of them did not exist at all They agreed to change our room but in a quite unpleasant manner of doing you a greatest favour imaginable We were moved to a quieter room so the rest was mostly OK To make it clear I do understand that this is a mostly conference and business travel fouced hotel but we once stayed in a simillar place on the outskirts of Barcelona and it was perfect whereas Da Vinci leaves much to be desired And from the standpoint of a business traveller I would hate the idea of trying to fall asleep in a room filled with elevator noises even more There are also construction works going outside and finding the hotel may be quite an issue , Value for money ratio was more or less fine even with all the negative aspects taken into consideration Location is fine if you are ready to use public transport and there s also a free parking so it s also OK if you are going to travel outside of Milan Rooms were reasonably large breakfasts were OK The staff in the restaurant was nice and helpful 
489038,Hotel Da Vinci, The breakfast was horible If you want to eat healty you Will remain hungry Junk fond Even the Coffee wasn t good , The room was clean and large 
489039,Hotel Da Vinci, I bit out of the way for most activities my GPS could not find despite the address as per booking com being confirmed , Spacious rooms comfortable and quiet
489040,Hotel Da Vinci, I felt the lack of staff and attitude wasnt helpful Also more supplies were needed in the rooms such as towels , Really good spacious rooms and a really great breakfast 
489041,Hotel Da Vinci, Receptionist very rude on both occasions Compared to all my he hotels we stayed in Europe this was by far the worst in terms of service Hotel was clean but is definitely not worth a 4 Star Rating , Beds were comfy and room modern 
489042,Hotel Da Vinci, The female members of staff on the reception were incredibly rude and miserable and the worst I have dealt with in any hotel during my trip in Italy This is a shame because it spoils the overall service when it could have the potential to be very good, I liked the breakfast The hotel has close links to the city centre The male member of staff on reception can t remember his name was courteous and friendly compared to the other staff
489043,Hotel Da Vinci, first night there was a lot of mosquitos but generally nothing bad i didn t see, good price value close to train station easy acess to center good range of brakfast options nice clean and quiet rooms helpfull staff
489044,Hotel Da Vinci, We booked a double room it was confirmed we would have an extra large double bed When we got to the room we had two single beds The reception staff wouldn t do anything about it and would not let us speak to management We had the buffet at the hotel for dinner The food was cold and very bland not at all worth the 22 50 we each had to pay for it For the whole night there was a fan blowing very loudly right above the room so it was not easy to sleep The breakfast the following morning was terrible It was mostly processed food again very bland There was no fresh fruit juice the only options were orange squash water or coffee The reception staff in the morning would still not allow us to speak to management about our appalling stay and instead said we would receive an email I have still hears nothing from the hotel not even an apology and I expect that j probably never will due to the fact not one member of staff showed any interest in either us as guests or the mistakes they had made ,No Positive
489045,Hotel Da Vinci, Coffee for breakfast was instant very crowded in the morning for breakfast There was reconstruction of congress hall while we were there Metro is 12 minutes of walk from hotel not very far but still a bit , Rooms are huge we could run in it Everything is new design is fresh breakfast everything you might need I m vegetarian and I was not hungry Direct lines of metro to Duomo and Centrale We left hotel at 8 32 by foot till subway and at 9 10 we were at Centrale Train station in front of hotel can take you to center 
489046,Hotel Da Vinci, The buffet breakfast although on the face of it looked plentiful varied and tasty But on closer inspection the foodstuffs were of poor quality with cold hot food Even the coffee was awful It s hard to find It s situated in an industrial park with unpaved parking facilities The front entrance is like walking through a housing estate They had room service Again with a varied menu But it was expensive with a very high service charge for delivery , There s not much to say about this place in a positive way other than I used it for Milan and drove into the city which isn t as dangerous as people make out The decor is modern and like another chain called Citizen M Or for the Brits who travel a very posh travelodge Premier Inn The decor was interesting with comfy beds 
489047,Hotel Da Vinci, The worst experience staying in hotel ever Not 4 hotel Staff is very rude The receptionist gave me the right room only form third time With the rude reply that he don t see the point in my complains The area is very bad Metro is 20 min by walking No shops no ATM Nothing there Very hard to find a hotel There are no signs on the street In the rooms there are no kettle So you are not able to enjoy tea or coffee in your room only buy in the bar The bath tap was broken So it took ages to fill the bath Instead of duvet cover they give just a sheet I know it is Italian way but in my opinion it is not hygienic In the check in you must give 100 euro deposit And city tax is 5 euro per night But all this is nothing in comparison with crowing roosters outside It was not possible to sleep It is insane to have this animals in hotel territory I could not believe it was happening The hotel was noisy by itself Bad noise isolation Do not recommend It could be a good hotel probably with another management , Interior and exterior Price Breakfast
489048,Hotel Da Vinci, It is quite far from the city centre of Milan but that is easily solved with the subway links that are only a 5 10 minute walk from the accommodation, Brilliant breakfast amazing rooms and very friendly staff This hotel is absolutely stunning
489049,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, The hotel was big and new Check in process was quite slow The hotel s front is currently under construction and not mentioned There was quite a bit of noise in the morning Also due to the construction work if you have a car you need to drive it out of the hotel and all the way around the block to get to the car park at the back of the hotel Abit of an issue The hotel is generally over packed with tourist buses meaning breakfast is jam packed in the morning with the tourist from the buses going crazy over breakfast Staff in the breakfast room was great They attended to requests such as coffee Location wise the hotel is quite far out from the city centre There is a train station close by but abit of a walk and not too appealing at night with the surrounding The neighborhood isn t the best 
489050,Hotel Da Vinci, Window was broke insects getting in Horrible Area Rock hard beds might as well sleep on the floor, Not much it was clean other than insects and big room
489051,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast area like a loud and busy canteen Rooster in the early morning Annoying elevator noise Water from the shower ran all the way into the room and made everything wet TV didn t work on arrival but got fixed No english or german speaking TV channels though This hotel needs a person in charge who really cares , Spacious room Ok breakfast offer 
489052,Hotel Da Vinci, The only negative point nothing to do with the staying itself was about the bar Me and boyfriend went downstairs to get a couple of drinks and the bartender practically ignored us and a couple of girls that were waiting because another guy asked some beers and served them first before all us waiting Obviously this doesn t change the good experience at all , It s my second time here and it was as good as the first time The room was clean and spacious and the location of the hotel is really helpful if you need to reach downtown within 30mins Helpful staff Even booked an extra night this time 
489053,Hotel Da Vinci, The hotel is cheap Really cheap This is italy and coffee at breakfast is instant coffee Breakfast has lowest quality products possible all in bulk to reduce price Room amenities minimal Bathroom amenities cheapest possible No way this is a 4 Maybe 2 , Staff were nice but totally overwhelemed by number of people
489054,Hotel Da Vinci, The only downsides to the Hotel are its location Situated a 20 minute walk or 5 minute bus ride away from Comasina Metro station on the very end of the yellow line The nearest shop is also a bus ride away and for some unknown reason to the front left and right of the hotel and actually sharing the same grounds are two very badly derelict old hotels kinda makes you remember seeing war torn Sarajevo on the news in the the 90s I m not sure why they are there but they ve both been completely stripped back to the concrete but it looks like there are no current plans to demolish them The only grumble we had was with the barman the drinks are very pricey not his fault but he was rather rude and a little disinterested to serve us and although clearly we were stood waiting he went to serve people who had walked up to the bar that second He was also rude to several other customers and walked off to serve other people whilst they were trying to order food , The rooms are very big the beds are enormous At a cost of 75 for two nights it was an absolute steal Breakfast is included which although continental it has a very big selection of food The decor inside may not be too everyone s taste but it gives itself to the name of the hotel Rooms are extremely modern bathrooms are large and of a great quality This is our second time at this hotel and I would say it s by far the best value for money hotel in the city 
489055,Hotel Da Vinci, The staff wasn t very helpful We ask for tea and coffe in the room and they could provide this service If we wanted we can buy it It apsolutely nightmare to ask extra for something in you room for free In the morning breakfast time you can choose a lot of coffe and tea and for free Also they have building site around hotel and it is very dengerous for tourists as no health and safety signs You can broke your bones easly, I can tell that bed was quite big so enough space to sleep That was the only thing
489056,Hotel Da Vinci, Stayed here in Feb 16 all excellent then however on arrival 1st night this time went to restaurant as staying in we ate at 8pm unfortunately not a full compliment of food on display empty food trays yet dinner available until 10pm sad Next evening 8 30pm in restaurant ALL food was COLD I asked mine to be put in microwave to quick heat still only luke warm so no microwave just in oven 2 mins People on table next to us the same cold Mentioned to head girl in restaurant eventually Chef brought out to try and solve the problem I don t think it happened Sorry meal was not worth the buffet price that night or the 1st Reception informed in am on pre check out not too much concern showed I only hope this is a one off as we will be staying here again 4 star rate needs to buck up So sad, Superior room high up perfect A bright and very clean hotel and friendly and helpful staff 
489057,Hotel Da Vinci, Hotel was between two large abandoned houses , Hotel was superb for money Roomy good bed clean exellent breakfast location near trainstation free secured parking friendly staff Hotel seems to be popular among younger people 
489058,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, The hotel is located near the highway with large parking space near the train station and near the metro station that brings you to the center of the Milan The rooms are large in quite area 
489059,Hotel Da Vinci, The light in the room was poor and some of the light bulbs were not working , The breakfast was incredible and there are various possibilities including fruits vegetables cereals pastry etc 
489060,Hotel Da Vinci, The neighborhood of hotel Nothing to see or do around, Very convenient hotel for those who are traveling around Italy by car and would like to stop in Milan for one or two days The hotel can be easily reached from the highway and has a free parking which means you don t have to waste your time in the traffic jams and save parking costs up to 4 h and 25 day The train to Milan center goes each 10 15 minutes and stops just outside the fence of hotel The last train back to hotel departs from the center after the midnight so probably the hotel is not the best choice if you want to see the nightlife of Milan but it is surely enough if you want to go out for an evening There is not much to say about the room it was very spacious and clean Overall happy with this choice 
489061,Hotel Da Vinci, A bit overcrowded at the breakfast in the mornings Sometimes you have to wait for a table , Big hotel with big parking First impression was spoiled a bit because when we came to the room it wasn t ready for us at all When I went back to the reception and told the staff about this they upgraded our room to a suite Which was a nice gesture The room was great The staff was very friendly Especially the security guys they were very polite and helpful all the time One of them really saved us when our car hadn t started up in the morning 
489062,Hotel Da Vinci, Apparently the room cleaning staff do not get paid unless you get your room serviced , The location was next to the train line and good access to the highway A4 
489063,Hotel Da Vinci, Nothing , It s way better than the comments here Parking is free and great Breakfast is really full with tons of options Location is just near the station so you can reach to downtown really easily Rooms are really modern and clean They even upgraded our room for free And it s really cheap for such quality Definitely would stay there again 
489064,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, The rooms were huge and very nicely laid out The shower was also amazing It was a rain shower with the option of the hose The breakfast was great Had everything from fruits to eggs to pastries The location was also good considering it was only a 15 minute direct metro on the yellow line right to Milan cathedral 
489065,Hotel Da Vinci, We did not get the room we reserved and this was presented to us as an upgrade we do not see how a queen bed is an upgrade from a king Staff talked over it showing little interest in our concerns All in all it was awesome though , This purple hotel had a nice special offer for the weekend It is conveniently located next to a railway station and near a metro stop We walked the 15 minutes to the metro stop which takes you straight into the centre of the tourist activities for 1 50 The breakfast buffet is great If you arrive in the evening and want a bite to eat nearby try Trattoria Casa Mia 
489066,Hotel Da Vinci, There was no kettle We didn t get the suite we asked for Baby could not get his milk warmed And despite ordering the kettle which is less than 10 pounds in the uk We got a broken one And there was no shop or ATM anywhere Fadi again from his own pocket offered me euros to get to the nearest ATM , The hotel itself and the bar Esp Fadi the bartender Really went above and beyond to redeem all the bad and turned them somewhat good
489067,Hotel Da Vinci, the staff was helpful but not proactive many times there were more people at the reception but nobody cared to ask how they can help or if we need something dont know if its a cultural thing but it would definitely make us feel more welcome, we loved the modern art design of the hotel and the short distance to trains buses and metro usually we book just some place to sleep hotel da vinci was definitely more than that 
489068,Hotel Da Vinci, Reception staff cold and unhelpful No sympathy with a problem we had No advice Just kept repeating the same thing over again Had no concern for me who was visibly upset just went on to serve someone else left me there shaking and upset Wouldn t let me see the manager said no manger there as it was a weekend What hotel of that size wouldn t have a manager on duty at all times Hotel located in a run down area it was near a train station though Roads to and from were absolutely shocking although I appreciate this is not the hotels fault Won t be going back again , Breakfast okay Room cleaned each day
489069,Hotel Da Vinci, I got a deal on my stay so it was less than the original price and while I think the price that I paid was worth it I do not think that the full price is worth it The hotel is a 15 minute train ride outside of the city center , It was very clean the bed was very nice and the breakfast was very good Also the staff were very friendly and very efficient The wifi was excellent and really fast The bathrooms were very nice as well 
489070,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, free parking breakfast was good for Italian standards enough variety to find something good comfortable for drivers close to highway but still silent room was huge I will use the hotel again the next time I am in Milan with a car 
489071,Hotel Da Vinci, Air condition too cold and the regulator doesn t work No good coffee for breakfast Restaurant has no pizzas, Beautiful room Friendly staff Location is a bit outside but still relatively good reachable
489072,Hotel Da Vinci, The staff are very rude slow service the location is not too good the bar down stairs is just horrid , The hotel s interior design is interesting 
489073,Hotel Da Vinci, The hotel blocked the amount two times and not yet returned my money The location wasn t good no supermarkets no restaurants too many touts It was too noisy because of the constructions near , Metro station is in 15 minutes 
489074,Hotel Da Vinci, I was charged to pay extra 120 euro s for the two rooms that I had already paid online I paid 275 euro for two rooms when I check out they told me I had to paid and extra 60 euro per room The help desk person was very unprofessional This was my second stay at this hotel I feel robed that i had to pay that amount , Soft bed s wonderful interior food
489075,Hotel Da Vinci, The bed could have have been a bit softer , The hotel was fun The rooms were very large Bathroom was big and shower was excellent Train station was close and just 4 stops from downtown Milan 
489076,Hotel Da Vinci, the surroundings of the hotel abandoned houses , Kitschy style it had everything too much but it was interesting and extraordinary due to that Comfy and extra large bed big room rich breakfast 
489077,Hotel Da Vinci, Check in takes 30 minutes big line up staff unfriendly I called the desk no idea about my question I m still talking the person alreadyhung up the phone The shower not working that makes the washroom wet Booked taxi ahead of time arrived very late I was told by the desk 100 Euro but driver insisted 120 Euro, Hotel is very nice big room and comfortable bed Location convenient to train station Good breakfast
489078,Hotel Da Vinci, Soundproofing isn t good Location from city centre Car is a must however you can get to the nearest metro station in 10mins by walking , Clean spacious rooms Excellent breakfast Parking area is secure and has a lot of room Friendly staff 
489079,Hotel Da Vinci, We checked in late at night and had to wait a long time The next morning just after 10am housekeeping disrespected the do not disturb signs and knocked on all doors of people leaving by noon to make sure we were awake and preparing to get the hell out of rooms , Modern and new with plenty of free parking 
489080,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast didn t have enough tables at all staff looked stressed and upset Reception was alittle unfriendly and uninformative Location is 15mins walk from metro and then metro to duomo is about 30mins not great but not the end of the world , WiFi was good value is good rooms were perfect and quiet area
489081,Hotel Da Vinci, I had a room on the top floor it was raining and water was flowing down from the ceiling I could not sleep all night long I informed the reception which did nothing and in the morning when I raised this point the receptionist said that sometimes happens just humidity and propose to not charge the bottle of water I took from the mini bar With regard to my rating he said we don t care Sir you can write anything you want ,No Positive
489082,Hotel Da Vinci, No tea or coffee making facilities in the room despite asking many times Location is not convenient for Milan or anywhere Hotel is not maintained to 4 star standard,No Positive
489083,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, I only stayed one night but loved this hotel Liked the big rooms everything was very clean Bathroom very nice Loved the decor of my room and hotel Staff were very nice and helpful Breakfast was free and very good with lots of choice Would stay here again and refer it to my friends Thanks Phyllis W 
489084,Hotel Da Vinci, They need to supply comfortable pillows and more of them , Staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast was varied and nice coffee was excellent Also close to the railway 
489085,Hotel Da Vinci, Staff is useful honestly We drove on our road trip around Europe from Paris and got there really tired GPS sent us to the location displayed on the site but the Hotel is not actually there So we called and after explained the lady with the very poor English on the phone that we couldn t find the property then she asked How can I help you So obviously she wasn t paying attention or didn t understood a single word It was everything prepaid but in the counter I were told they block 50 Euro per night 2 night stay from my credit card for the mini bar that content specifically 2 bottle of water 4 assorted soda cans 1 beer and a bottle of orange juice So I have a quite expensive minibar , Room was very good Internet is OK Far away from everything but 8 min metro access walk 
489086,Hotel Da Vinci, There were some high school kids staying over and they were yelling a lot a singing and jumping so it was horrible notice However we called the reception and they said they will send a security and really in 10 minutes there was no more noise and everything was perfect , Hotel seems like new everything is tide and clean and room was absolutely amazing Internet is extremely good skype and youtube are streaming flawless Location is good for not spoiled tourists takes 15min walk from metro station or if you are by car it is perfect as high way is 3min away and hotel has garage 
489087,Hotel Da Vinci, Big traffic in breakfast Not nice restaurant for dinner buffet only avg quality food options A bit impersonal huge hotel , Modern hotel design Spacious clean and contemporary rooms Next to train station Free car parking 
489088,Hotel Da Vinci, it took so much time to check out recepcionist anwsered many phon calls during she checked us out At the morning people were waiting in long que to get inside the restaurant to eat breakfast , Personel was nice and polite Delicious breakfast and large selections of meals specially sweet one 
489089,Hotel Da Vinci, Not what I would call 4 star Very noisy room It sounded like the window was open and I was awoken by cockerels at dawn every morning Breakfast was poor hot food not kept warm lack of care shown I felt , Great eclectic collection of artwork in curious styles Good feel 
489090,Hotel Da Vinci, Staff was not very friendly , Room was very nice breakfast was very good a bit crowded on the weekend but overall excellent Staff could be a bit friendlier Location is about 10 15 minute walk to yellow line so excellent 
489091,Hotel Da Vinci, I wondered why this hotel was so cheap I guess it was because it is located in the middle of what seems like the ghetto of Milan Lots of out of business building and graffiti on every single standing structure There was a man in the gates parking lot of the hotel who was peering into people s cars We told the staff and they said they d send security out but refused to hear a description of the guy The guy left and they didn t get to talk to him We went downtown and came back around sunset The man was back this time in different clothes and an umbrella cause it was raining He was again stalking the parking lot our room had a view of the parking lot We told the staff he was back they refused to call security or even talk to him to see if he was a guest of the hotel I guess they didn t care that he was touching and looking into the hotel guest cars The staff was rude and said Is this a problem for you I said Yes it is but they still did nothing He stayed out there till we got tired of checking and fell asleep , Nice hotel good breakfast and clean rooms 
489092,Hotel Da Vinci, Plastic furniture in the lobby hotel Very complicated income streets and parking Although there is possibility to come with car just to the back entrance in the hotel it is not understandable when you come at parking We understood it just upon we left hotel So almost everybody brings their suitcases down the stairs There is no line for suitcases , Excellent breakfast OK rooms 
489093,Hotel Da Vinci, There was no individual sanity kit like toothbrush and paste but there were shampoos and shower gels , Staff speaks English very well so there were no problems during check in Really good American and continental breakfast Nice design 
489094,Hotel Da Vinci, The breakfast room was too small for the no of guest and people were standing around as if it were McDonald s waiting to grab a seat It was ashamed because the food was fine They should have opened the restaurant for guest as an overflow, The staff were wonderful particularly in the restaurant etc the food was good and the gardens beautiful
489095,Hotel Da Vinci, I didn t like that we were told to pay local tax charges on arrival at no point was this made clear In addition there was no kettle and cups in hotel room and we were not told that we would be charged for taking anything in the little fridge Even though we didn t use any most 4 star 5 star hotels have them as complimentary so I think it s important to tell visitors what they will and won t be charged for , It s not too far away from metro and tram links into the centre Staff are very friendly rooms are definitely four star spacious and well done There was no noise I could hear which was good I loved the bold colours and themes 
489096,Hotel Da Vinci, They gave me a room right beside the elevator I asked for an room exchange within 10 mins after geting in that noice room which feels like construction is ongoing but the reception first refused to exchange , Bed is big and comfortable 
489097,Hotel Da Vinci, It was difficult to find it even with GPS The light above the sink was not working It was cold in the room Since my bank account was periodically blocked with a bigger amount than the value of the reserved accommodation I expected a higher quality ,No Positive
489098,Hotel Da Vinci, It s far from train station 15 minutes walk and city centre, The hotel was really good I love the cleanliness good staff quality delicious breakfast
489099,Hotel Da Vinci, Quite a distance from everything so had to use the underground quite alot Also room service wasn t great Took a long time to be able to get through and the the food wasn t too good , The rooms were beautiful and the staff really helpful Breakfast was lovely and a lot to choose from 
489100,Hotel Da Vinci, Location more than 15 minutes walk to metro but when u in the metro very convenient No shop or restaurant or cafe around , WiFi extra large bed lobby decoration 
489101,Hotel Da Vinci, Too professional Charged extra 60 euro for my 6 year old daughter even though I didn t ask for extra bed However they forced to take it That way a new experience for me , Breakfast decoration staff
489102,Hotel Da Vinci, Wifi was sometimes troubling us Had to log in again each time and sometimes got refused A bit slow service at the reception when checking out There s obviously a huge lot of paperwork to do , Spacious rooms large balcony The hotel was in a good location near the M1 railway line so convenient to go to the city centre Though not many supermarkets or restaurants around to buy groceries or eat out You can use hotel s own restaurant of course The breakfast was great with a lot of choice and quick service 
489103,Hotel Da Vinci, More drawers in the room Bed coverings can be cleaner When we booked it was written no need payment but the 6th day when we returned to hotel our key didnt work When we asked why they said you havent paid for we found this explanation is stupid because till that time no one warned or informed us about it Although we had paid for the next day evening our key didnt work again this time they said we dont know why this point should be improved if you dont stay in the room during day time it is ok but if you have to stay you should know there is construction in front garden side , Breakfast is very rich Maybe we couldnt find bread for celiac people but there are green salads even cherry tomatoes salamis cheeses cakes cookies youghurt fruits coffee tea and other cold drinks for breakfast Breakfast team is very helpful They are like ants they clean the tables and try to find place to people who are waiting in front of door Hotel has a huge area and i think next 2 old buildings will be join to facility in few years That time it would be hard to find a place in autopark for the car There is a very big autopark indeed and it is free Rooms are big but there are not enough wardrobe and drawers i can say rooms are designed by a minimalist style Wifi connecton is good Hotel is located in Comasina 30 min by metro very quite area Metro station takes 5 10 minutes by walking Towels are clean it is a safe hotel 
489104,Hotel Da Vinci, not enough facilities basic lounge and bar not enough choice at a la carte restaurant , great interior very close to train station to go to milan center parking is free and available 
489105,Hotel Da Vinci, Reception not really overwhelmingly friendly need to be basis only Generally staff not very fluent in at least English sometimes hard to communicate and skilled service Dinner buffet ALL hot things were cold Throw away plastic cups for the juice at breakfast and the same cups in the bathroom are you serious What an environmental sin The hotel itself was very cold no good heating plus windows open at 10 15 C The room has had an aircon that cools in summer and only heats in winter Unfortunately it was already on summer mode and could not be changed No alternate heating available mobile heater Really not nice with a 13 months old child at night and this year s April temperatures Location of the hotel was far far away from anything plus quite awful in the middle of a rather gloomy residential area of Milano Would I recommend this hotel No there must be better hotels at comparable rates , Copious buffet breakfast with good service Very comprehensive and inexpensive dinner buffet at only EUR 19 90 all you can eat Stylish as seen online Guarded parking and WLAN free of charge Good price at EUR 69 90 however plus 10 Milano tax plus 10 pet 
489106,Hotel Da Vinci, The hotel distance from city central could be less but near the hotel is metro station so it s easy to get there , Very plentiful breakfast cozy room helpful stuff near the hotel is the park with pond 
489107,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, The best hotel during our Italy trip Service just excellent our room was upgraded to Superior Breakfast was nice and tasty We can recommend that perfectly located hotel 
489108,Hotel Da Vinci, One answer to a question Excuse me miss how can I turn on the heat it s 15 degrees celsius in my room Answer The heating sesaon in Italy is over so You can t we have no other means of making the room axcepteble to sleep in but I can give you blanket , Hotel s decor is like a French car Citr en Diana from 70is and early 80is ugly as virgin at 50is Da Vinci Hotel is so disbalnaced in stile that it gives the vibe lika a intersting newage hipster ugly giril 
489109,Hotel Da Vinci, Hotel needs a proper restaurant for dinner not just a buffet and although the rooms are quiet the opening and closing of doors from the corridor is loud and does disturb your sleep , The room was very spacious and clean with a very big and comfortable bed and great shower The location was great for us due to easy access to motorway and train station Good choice at breakfast 
489110,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, All of the staff were so helpful and polite Especially Koli who went miles out of his way to ensure we had a good holiday Cannot thank him enough 
489111,Hotel Da Vinci, We didn t like the fact that they asked us for a credit card as a guarantee for the extra charges or the damage that we may cause in the room In case that someone didn t have a credit card they had to give 100 euros that they would take back in the check out I think that they should inform us earlier about the this and not during the check in Anyway take your credit card with you and you will be fine Another problem was the location which was ok in case you were travelling by car but public transport doesn t reach the hotel so we had to walk 15 minutes from the last metro station to get there In our case we didn t mind walking Overall the hotel was totally worth it , I went to milan with my boyfriend and we stayed at Da Vinci hotel It was a very nice stay and we enjoyed everything The room was big and very clean the staff was really helpful and the breakfast was delicious Compared to its price it offers great quality 
489112,Hotel Da Vinci, No soundproofing which can be a little annoying when you can listen to evry detail of neighbours having sex Design is a bit loud and odd in rooms and places Surrounding area a bit dodgy hotel not easy to find must have a car, Breakfast was good Choice was plentiful and of good quality Rooms are spacious 
489113,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, The breakfast food was excellent Great variety lots of flavors to choose from and good taste The hotel room was very clean and the staff was friendly and we could easily get all the information we wanted The bed was plus sized and extremly comfy Really enjoyed everything 
489114,Hotel Da Vinci, The hotel is 15 minute walking distance from a metro station which will seem far after a day of visiting when you are exhausted The area is far away from the city so if you want to get something to eat at night good luck You will not feel you are in Milan but somewhere near Milan from where you commute daily The rooms were very NOISY The windows were very badly soundproof so it was the same if they were open or closed Same for the entrance door I always heard everything that happened on the hallway loud and clear Plus my room was next to the elevator Great The thing that bothered me the most is that they blocked 200 euros from my card when I got there and now two days after I got back the money is still blocked Unacceptable Another horrible thing was the temperature it was very cold and the heating didn t work The temperature we set on the thermostat made no difference on the actual room temperature We kind of froze a little Thank God it was spring Also I don t get it how they are rated 4 stars They have no facilities at all no pool gym etc I would not stay here again nor recommend anyone to do so People if you want to get a real feel of Milan stay at the hotel in the city not in the countryside You ll want to get a shower after a day of walking around and then go get dinner Better take a three star hotel in the heart of the city if you re budget conscientious than daVinci You ll spend more money on night taxis otherwise anyway , The breakfast was pretty good The rooms were pretty 
489115,Hotel Da Vinci, Rooms not sound isolated so a lot of noise from the corridor The room feels cheap and the bathroom doesn t have a place to hang a towel There are 4 elevators but somehow you still have to wait a while , Big rooms free parking and WIFI Close to a train station

489119,Hotel Da Vinci, This big purple hotel is in the middle of nowhere The metro was 800 meters away Taxi to Milan 20 euros one way Absolutely nothing to do People were checking in finding out there was nothing to do in the area and then checking right back out of the hotel Seemed to be a common occurrence Also there are roosters in the front gardens crowing at all hours , Nothing Absolutely nothing 
489120,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Hotel was realy nice and comfty The rooms are big This hotel is perfect for those who come in Milano with a car because it offers a free parking place with video secure Metro station is 10min walk from hotel and goes directly to center of Milano Duomo The breakfast was great and we will deffinity come again 
489121,Hotel Da Vinci, Reception is a mess Check in wasn t flawless Room key was deactivated very early on the day of departure , Very easy access to the city with both train and underground Comfy big bed Breakfast is good but ask for coffee from the floor staff instead of using the machines Way much better 
489122,Hotel Da Vinci, The breakfast area It s huge and full of people because its a big hotel and unless you want kids to scream all around you dogs to shake their fur in your food yes they allow animals to come in and people to knock you off when you have the food in your hands There s no way you can have a peaceful breakfast there The food is not that diverse anyways same old stuff everyday The bar is really expensive you would imagine they would have smaller prices since you already pay for your stay but in some cases its more expensive than downtown , Big rooms and bathrooms with everything you need Good and stable internet connection In all rooms you can find indications and tips for visiting downtown and directions to and from the airports 
489123,Hotel Da Vinci, I have paid premium price as its a busy week in Milan and I had a good start with an upgrade The room had a plumbing issue that led to bad smell in the room The quality is not the best but it is new Staff have an opportunity to improve how to deal with requests I asked if I could extend the stay for another night and were told the hotel were complete Then a few notes and low voices passed between the lady behind the counter and I presume her boss and she came back with Yes you can stay for 800 euros per night I think there normal rates are 90 euro to 120 euros so a HUGE increase for an average hotel They would have been better off saying there were no rooms rather than insult me or as they say in Italy Preso per il culo Its a no show next time , Its new Its quiete Breakfast ok 
489124,Hotel Da Vinci, Staff are not friendly we had to stand in long que and found that they gave us the wrong room when we came back they changed it but with rude behavior room was totally uncomfortable mattress was hard AC is not working with the excuse that it is still winter eventhough it was hot not good isolated room from noise we hear the other rooms and the housekeeping when they push a noisy trolly and speaking near room with children run in corridors all time Sunday there are workers in the garden with loud machines No near restaurants and hard to reach the hotel with car , Clean room and wide good wifi connection Breakfast buffet with good varieties Location near a train station and free parking Nice decorations

489128,Hotel Da Vinci, We arrived so tired and so late and when we asked the receptionist to have a fast check in he shauted and he was speaking with us in so bad mode after registering our passports we surprised that we are overbooked and there is someone took our rooms so bad staff and there is no any kind of respect for the guest I don t recommend this hotel,No Positive
489129,Hotel Da Vinci, Didn t like the location Would not have gone out for a walk or to find anything to eat nearby I found the public areas soulless My husband had no problem with the public areas other than agreeing with me that there was a strong smell of cheap disinfectant around reception whilst we were waiting to check in Very warm in the room overnight couldn t have the window open because of the noise of the cockerals , Loved the room bathroom Very comfortable bed

489134,Hotel Da Vinci, The restaurant is in a remote location however it is a short walk approx 10 minutes to the closest metro station The staff were not very helpful however there is a computer in the reception to help you get around Milan Be aware of the air conditioning there are only two settings on and off and the hotel decides whether it is hot or cold so you may need to use the natural air outside to cool down as the hotel is very hot , Myself and my husband enjoyed the fun furniture and the yummy breakfast The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was always kept to a high cleanliness standard We had come from London and so used the safe in the room to keep our possessions The cleaners were good as they kept our essentials topped up and provided new clean towels daily As we stayed at an off peak time the price was very reasonable however I am aware it can change in peak season

489139,Hotel Da Vinci, room for breakfast is to small for that big hotel it was to crowded the morning and it was hard to get a table breakfast was also not that tasteful bed in the room was really stiff and the bathroom could have been a bit cleaner, great location because it is near train station and by train you need 20 min to center parking is free and big people on the reception where nice and polite
489140,Hotel Da Vinci, I didn t like so much the reception My sister needed a baby bed and we ask for one before we booked but after we camed they told us they didn t had a baby bed anymore and she still had to pay for it And the biggest problem for me was the way employes talk to you a litle bit arrogant We were claiming the baby bed the other employes were constantly talking in italian between them while we were claiming our rights And i didn t like it so much , The hotel is pretty confortable clean and really big 
489141,Hotel Da Vinci, A little bit problem is that this hotel is not so near to the centre but for the people who needs service near by Highways Da Vinci is perfect choise , All servise was very good

489147,Hotel Da Vinci, The Hotel located far from the main road and it s in a one way street so you should follow the signs for the hotel however there was not clear big signs to direct you in to the hotel besides the parking located behind the hotel so you will do this procedure twice Clean the rooms without prior notification there was not so many things in the room as the hotel is 4 star like free drinkable water slipper tea coffee Hotel has a buffet dinner with reasonable price however it was full of sea food chicken and meat plus salad and desert but we expected Italian food from Italian hotel There were too much people in breakfast area which show that the breakfast area is too small compare ti the number of rooms in hotel but the the personnel tried their best to provide the guest the best service , Nice Design and decoration Number of Elevators Free Private Parking Private big balcony Breakfast Silence Room with good sound isolation good services in breakfast Internet

489161,Hotel Da Vinci, Decorations are very Kitsch my guess is that Lewis Caroll s Alice would feel like her Wonderland here but nevertheless brand new Breakfast was ok but nothing special or very high quality Although the hotel is not central is it easy to reach it by public transportation Our option was to take the subway to Comasina and then to cross the bridge on foot and hop on bus no 41 for one stop only , For our one night stay the hotel was great it was quiet We had a huge room sort of a family room with a small bed near the enormous king size bed We loved the shower very nice for a young couple on a romantic escape Breakfast was OK There were quite a few choices salads cereals pastries cheese eggs bacon ham butter jams nutella juices yogurts I guess if you want a proper cappuccino latte you have to ask the waiters normal for Italy For me the espresso machine sufficed this time 
489162,Hotel Da Vinci, Very strange place This is not something you would expect from a 4 star hotel The room was really big but with dirty bed covers and not clean floor The dishes used for breakfast were also not sufficiently clean including the lipstick stain on the cup Not sure about the location Perhaps it s convenient if you have some business meetings in the area Otherwise it s far from the city center You get what you pay for , Cheap big rooms newly renovated free parking

489166,Hotel Da Vinci, We stayed at the 6th floor and it was very warm even though the heating wasn t on and the airco didn t work so well the noise of the roosters who were clucking outside at 2 o clock in the night was not very pleasant , Breakfast was good The staff was very friendly if you asked something it would be brought to you immediatly The price was very cheap for a hotel like this

489170,Hotel Da Vinci, The outside color of the hotel is very bad If you need to choose by outside views of the hotels for sure this will not be on your list But after you see the Reception all look like as normal , The design of the room Breakfast very good
489171,Hotel Da Vinci, The night staff were helpful polite but during the day the staff all seemed to have an attitude The cleaner was plain rude although she could not communicate with us she knocked and told us to leave the room signalling with arm gestures that she wanted to clean it I asked her to leave it as it was my birthday I wanted to chill I said I was happy for her to just change the towels she scowled at us moaning in Italian then had the cheek to give us dirty looks throughout the rest of our stay There was also a mix up by the hotel with the 2 rooms I booked resulting in us paying a late checkout fee of 30 for the hour we tried to complain but were told there was no manager Needs a overhaul in customer service Don t eat here if you can help it catering needs an overhaul most of the food is cold Very disappointed It s a lovely looking hotel Im not sure if I would suggest this hotel its nowhere near the heart of it and it s sandwiched between derelict buildings this I wouldn t mind if the staff appeared to care about your concerns or were the least bit helpful Know some Italian as you can feel talked about rather than to when communicating with staff Beware airport shuttle is expensive as are the taxis use the Rail to Bruzzano, Lovely sized rooms and hotel decor Close to the rail station 
489172,Hotel Da Vinci, There a was a kind of smell every morning at the restaurant which was really plaguy while you eat I hope this was only for those days Also the mattress was not to comfortable , The reception guy during our check in named Stefano was great He helped us a lot for everything we asked and needed Staff was friendy amd helpful while when i called reservation department before a lady who asnwered was not too polite The hotel was big nice with good and clean rooms Hotel is located 4metro stations away from piazza duomo Just take the yellow line direction comasina If you are walking try to use gps or google maps to get it faster It is near the metro station but it might become tricky to find if would walk around

489207,Hotel Da Vinci, Indeed the hotel is not sound proof you can hear a noisy neighbor but few hotels are actually sound proof , Those who complaint about the distance to the center they are very lazy people The Subway station is 12 minutes away by foot Once you reach the subway you have direct line to center Duomo about 20 minutes The Central station is even closer direct line You also have at 1 minute distance a bus station and at 3 minutes a rail station for some metropolitan trains you can use the same metro ticket inside Milano The rooms look great big rooms big bathroom The breakfast is good cheese bacon sausage cereals fruits pastry Not excellent but good enough Considering the price it is a great deal

489212,Hotel Da Vinci, Location it was too far from center of Milan Dry cleaner was poor i asked to clean my lather jacket but the spots from perfume were still appeared , Room staff breakfast cleanness wifi Style of hotel modern 
489213,Hotel Da Vinci, The metro station was 800m away from the hotel and when you arrive at the metro station there is no transportation to get to the hotel You have to walk all the way with the luggage If you arrive at night it s horrifying It would have been great if the hotel had a bus shuttle service There is a restaurant but it was never open It would be nice if there was a shop in the hotel selling souvenirs sweets snacks water etc The house keeping always kept bringing us three towels instead of four even though I told them every day that two of us had to share the same towel The breakfast was big but always the same things , Modern clean big spacious room The breakfast was good

489221,Hotel Da Vinci, We enjoyed our stay untill we went out one day and returned to find that all our shampoo soap toothpaste and toothbrushes and a few other things had been taken from our room Nobody in the hotel seemed to know where they had gone and didnt seem to be bothered or prepared to do anything about it Due to its location we were unable to just go to a shop and buy more We have been all over the world to many hotels and have never had anything taken from our room ,No Positive
489222,Hotel Da Vinci, The elvator wasnt working most of the time and the order was being for one person not three as we ordered probaly a problem of the Booking site, Very good location outside Milano no traffic jams very comfrtable and big rooms great breakfast
489223,Hotel Da Vinci, The address of the hotel is not Recognised by the gps, All the members of staff are very helpful especially at the reception a lady called elissa The breakfast selection was very good 
489224,Hotel Da Vinci, It seems that hotel used to be in a better shape Leaking shower wobbly doors and windows bed sheets with noticeable traces of long washing history everything used to be great but now could use some maintenance Not a big concern though despite being tired our room was clean and comfortable , We enjoyed our stay a lot Even though we arrived at 1am the guy at reception was helpful and friendly Location might look like it is far from centre but actually it takes only around 20 minutes to get to the Duomo by metro Breakfast was amazing Good selection of food that will fit even vegan needs Price is another great thing about this hotel We booked for 3 nights and our total was about at the same level as 2 beds in a hostel for the same period No brainer huh 
489225,Hotel Da Vinci, The reception personal wasn t so well informed about visiting places of Milano also a bit undriendly In the garden are chicken wakeing you up in the morning , We liked the big and confortable bed and the lights around it Also the brekfast was diversified You have 10min to walk until metro station Comasina or you can take the bus close to the hotel bus no 41 until metro station Affori FN 
489226,Hotel Da Vinci, minor points needs a ramp between parking n entrance to not carry baggage Italian maintenance plugs loose toilet p hold fell off heat thermostat not perfect but it s Italy a booking com issue hidden surcharge of 5 pP pN Should be more honest , Outside Milan half Metro ticket 4 50 24 hrs u need anyhow great free guarded parking spacious rooms quiet Best astounding 70 item breakfast not seen in lifetime travel in 50 countries 5 mio airmiles planned 1 night stayed 3 full satisfaction again soon Better than 10 hotels I stayed at before at Milano at 2 3 x price 
489227,Hotel Da Vinci, The location of the hotel is far from the metro station If you have a baby with stroller without car it will not be so easy to get the metro station And at the night the street is dark Last day a found another way to reach the hotel is to take the metro to Afortti FN the station before the hotel station Comasina and take the bus 41 for 5 stops to bus stop 50m away from the hotel , The room size is great and clean Breakfast is very good Staff is friendly Good value for money 
489228,Hotel Da Vinci, Position is not good if you don t have a car And even with a car it takes 20 mins to enter in the city but be careful at the hours otherwise it takes much more, Bed is good and comfortable Bathroom is big and modernly designed Breakfast is with great choice worth of a 4 
489229,Hotel Da Vinci, A bit far away from downtown but it s ok if you move by car Un peu loin du centre ville mais ca va si vous vous deplacez en voiture , Good arranged h tel but reasonable price Un hotel bien arrang mais prix raisonable

489234,Hotel Da Vinci, Staff is extremely unfriendly hardly speak any English Walls are paper like thin so rooms are very noisy Restaurant is unpleasant atmosphere food not great waiters simply rude, Room was just redecorated so new bathroom so clean and new looking
489235,Hotel Da Vinci, There are roosters that crowe very early in the morning that can wake you up at sunrise , Good location as it is close to the Metro and not a busy area outside the city 
489236,Hotel Da Vinci, Flat pillows and rock hard no spare pillows available No duvet or blanket available only a sheet Mattress was all lumpy and collapsed in places No shower curtain which caused water to splash onto the floor No slippers No air con or heating No ironing board or iron available No table in room to do any writing and work on laptop Room was covered in dust and wasn t cleaned in 4 days except the bed was turned daily Laminate floor was poorly layed down Requested quite room but it was like being next to a farm Every hour a cockerel would start crowing The lift created so much noise it would wake me up during the night Other hotel guests passing in the hallway would also wake me up The list goes on , Absolutely nothing 
489237,Hotel Da Vinci, We had booked a room for 4 peuple and asked via Booking for an extra bed it said on site that they were available in hotel When we arrived at the hotel we were told that it was not possible to have an extra bed the hotel admitted that they should have informed us and the only solution was to pay 660 for 2 nights for a second room more than the cost of our room for 4 We therefore had to find another hotel a bit cheaper and sleep apart as we couldn t cancel our room The deco in the hotel is cheap looking and it is in an undesirable suburb of Milan From our window we had a view of a derelict building , The room was OK but deco a bit cold 
489238,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Read the reviews if this hotel after booking and was worried but it was wonderful Rooms were decorated beautifully and huge I booked twin beds and were given two doubles Bathroom was lovely free mini bar free to use safe great thick curtains to shut out the light Used the restaurant once but although nice the menu wasn t my taste fussy eater Breakfast was faultless so much choice can t see why anyone would disagree Right next to Metro so easy to explore Milan This hotel probably my best yet in the last year of travelling for work Very pet friendly too with non carpeted rooms Can t wait to go says me who s fussy about everything If I had one complaint that would be no kettle but I carry one anyway 
489239,Hotel Da Vinci, only a very little detail that is easy to fix for the property there was no shower curtain in the in bathtub shower, perfect situation for a weekend trip to Milano The property is only about 15 Min by train or metro to the City Center train station is right in front of the hotel car park metro station is a 10 Min walk from the hotel big complimentary car park property is easy to access by car rooms are spacious
489240,Hotel Da Vinci, Neither close to the expo nor close to the city in the middle of nowhere except for trains Men at reception hopeless women ok Cold dark and noisy rooms , Large rooms but spartan and not soundproof Good beds good bathtub but unfinished bathroom Clean Breakfast good Ample parking Tiny train station nearby 
489241,Hotel Da Vinci, It didn t seem as a 4 star hotel no slippers or bathrobe no lotion or hair conditioner only shampoo soap no shower curtains the water gets easily on bathroom floor which is not heated there was weird switch in the shower which does nothing and has a rope hanging from it no tea pot in the room no shoe polish no minibar or room service price list The hotel is between two unfinished buildings there are no shops or any place to eat near I wouldn t recommend booking this hotel for the full price if you are expecting 4star hotel but if you get good deal it is ok, The interior was beautiful and room was big and clean there was safe in the room There was a lot of choice for breakfast
489242,Hotel Da Vinci, It was missing basic amenities We had to pay for water even though we had a superior suite and it s supposed to be a 4 star hotel There were also no cups in the room There were extremely loud roosters around the area of the hotel that woke us up everyday before dawn It was really strange and unpleasant The hotel is located in a sketchy area far from the last stop on the yellow metro line It had a horrible location , The room was very nice 
489243,Hotel Da Vinci, The personell at the main bar the worst experience ever a smile will not kill anyone, Good room spacious very good breakfast and clean room personel in breakfast very polite

489245,Hotel Da Vinci, It was said that we can check in earlier at 10 a m although we had to wait til 14 p m It was a little irritating , Delicious breakfast very big and comfortable bed clean room modern style quiet location beautiful garden 
489246,Hotel Da Vinci, 1 The reception staff took city tax from my wife although she was a milan resident and italian which is against rulse they told me the computer system couldnt exclude here 2 The free car parking is behind the hotel and connected through about 45 ledder steps which means you have to carry your bags ups and downs those steps in check in and check out 3 No room boiler cafe or tea although its 4 stars hotel 4 The hotel isnt perfect for thoses with out Cars most of the clients had cars and ao it was totally suiting them , The location Bruzzano is a good area near milano center and also those who want to visit North italy and swiss The hotel design is so nice and artistic Inspired ftom davinci designs the staff were nice good breakfast nice room mine was superior with light effects it was clean the wifi was good the lifts were working 2 or 3 of the 4 available which was good no more than 2 min waiting although the hotel was crowded 
489247,Hotel Da Vinci, you have to wait several minutes to go down with the elavator breakfast room is a sort of cheap looking basement with platic chairs and tables It is way out of city center if you get a taxi to anywhere you have to pay at least 12 euro more since they come from city center, clean and spacy room friendly staff out of ztl und easy to get on highways if you are supposed to get out of milan free parking lot
489248,Hotel Da Vinci, Long way from the nearest subway station Isolated with poor infrastructure completely inconvenient furniture everywhere , Nice and polite personell new hotel with interesting design Rich breakfast 
489249,Hotel Da Vinci, When we left the hotel my girlfriend broke her arm We left via the main entrance and she used the slope next to the stairs because she was having a roller case with her The marble like floor was so slippery that she fell and broke her arm The security person that we passed when we left only understood Italian so we could not communicate the issue e g to prevent other people from experiencing a similar fall Another issue from a completely different nature was that the shower head in the bathroom was spraying a lot of water towards the ceiling instead of to the floor which resulted in a completely wet ceiling and cold water dripping from the ceiling , Modern and clean hotel We had a spacious room with very good bed 
489250,Hotel Da Vinci, a bit difficult to find due to the one ways there the fact the parking access is from the back , close to train station suburban free parking excellent breakfast nice smiling staff
489251,Hotel Da Vinci, worst location possible 1 km walk from comasina metro station and no pick and drop or taxis available hardly You see customers walking up and down with luggage to hotel from station which is very incoveneint At least hotel should arrange shuttle to metro if not the city center, Staff was very helpful
489252,Hotel Da Vinci, It s not 700 hundred meters from metro station And it was not 10 minutes by taxi to Expo So I think the hotel has to provide honest information about location and services, Room design Friendly stuff

489254,Hotel Da Vinci, Long waiting time for check in and check out staff and procedure is not very efficient Heating System in the room stops at night in order not to freeze we asked for a second blanket To get the second blanket we had to go 2 times to the reception and call them additional 3 times They always promised to bring it to to the room but it never came Finally when I went to the reception again and waited there I got it and the problem was solved , The room is nice and big We got a nice baby bed Staff at breakfast is very attentive 
489255,Hotel Da Vinci, Guests are not allowed to drive into the hotel driveway in front of the main gate but rather instructed to drive to the main parking in the back of the hotel where they have to carry their own luggage down and up a couple of flights of stairs before they reach the elevator in all fairness a member of the staff offered to carry the luggage up those stairs while checking out Hotel address in the website does not correspond with the parking address therefore guests will have to make a detour across one way streets to find the parking on their second try We had a bed related malfunction as the headstand dismounted from its holder but luckily we escaped unharmed , The room was well furnished with a contemporary design like the entire hotel and spacious The free parking is convenient and Metro station with direct connections to Centrale and Duomo stations is 10min walk away The breakfast was diverse and the coffee was excellent Restaurant staff was helpful and friendly but spoke little to no English The entire hotel looks new 
489256,Hotel Da Vinci, FChecking in and out waiting time and minimal seating at reception The lifts broke down , Modern spacious facilities with large comfortable bed Breakfast choice and restaurant meals both very good The re was a train station behind and right next to the hotel yet I was given directions to the metro which was a 15 minute walk away Would like to have been told about the train option to get to the city as it turned out to be very convenient 
489257,Hotel Da Vinci, Everything else the price the room looked like a hollow space needing work the requests were so delayed and much more, The receptionist was more polite than other hotels in Italy But maybe it s because I was also too polite with her or maybe she is really good we will never know 
489258,Hotel Da Vinci, In the room you could hear everything from other rooms Let s not mention the noise coming from the elevator every time it moved It was almost impossible to sleep Heating didn t work and it was a little cold Shower sometimes cold sometimes warm , Room was not small and breakfast not so bad Polite Staff but very long check in maybe cos inexperienced Nice that parking is free
489259,Hotel Da Vinci, The elevators didn t work properly so we had to use the stairs most of the time The location of the hotel is not great but it is well connected with the main roads , Very friendly staff
489260,Hotel Da Vinci, Lack of furniture and storage in the room No tea or coffee facilities in the room Furnishings look childish and the backless seats in the bar area do not allow you to sit back and relax , Close to the metro 
489261,Hotel Da Vinci, The location was terrible 4 stops on the train outside of Milan but also literally a rose between two thorns as the two building next door were derelict The train station is literally next door so that is convenient but the last train back is before 11pm so restricts what you can do at night A taxi into the centre or Milan Expo is nearly 30 E No facilities for such a big hotel For a 4 Star Hotel you would expect at least a swimming pool , It s a large hotel that looks nice from the inside and outside Staff were friendly and helpful when asked 
489262,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Train station 2 min from the hotel very nice breakfast and lovely breakfast staff especially indian background girl sorry did not get her name

489268,Hotel Da Vinci, The modern colour scheme is not everybody s taste but worked The chairs in the bar were uncomfortable The restaurant leaves a lot to desire and the location is awful Looked like derelict parking houses around us , The rooms were nice clean and airy The bathrooms were also excellent 
489269,Hotel Da Vinci, The elevators were disabled We had to use the stairs during the five days that we spent in the hotel Loud noise after midnight on Friday sourced from the garden and continued to late hours of the night Long distance to the nearest metro station 20 25 minutes walk and almost need a taxi to the nearest restaurant , Rooms space and its Hygiene
489270,Hotel Da Vinci, Far from city center you need a car to reach , Free Parking wonderfull garden Staff value for money breakfast spacious rooms quit place near train station
489271,Hotel Da Vinci, Very roud staff don t bother negotiating with them because they won t listen either way Specially Sara in the reception I never mention names in my complains but she was so unrespectful Internet service was soo bad We kept asking for an iron from the first day we arrived and every day we d call but unfortunately we checked out the 5th day and they never brought us one saying their is only one iron in the hole hotel , The design of the room was nice
489272,Hotel Da Vinci, The hotel is comparably far from the metro station 15 min on foot and city center 25min on metro , The room is very nice fresh new and clean All facilities are shiny new and working well 
489273,Hotel Da Vinci, 4 Lifts never working people up and down the stairs with heavy luggage No staff helping with luggage at all The small tables for breakfast was a huge miss we put 2 of them together to accommodate the family of 5 2 adults 3 children and the staff separated us back into 2 tables claiming it was forbidden and we were wasting sitting space To note breakfast is served in a huge room and there were plenty of empty tables , Liked the room and the bathroom large comfortable and newly renovated Parking available on site at no extra cost 
489274,Hotel Da Vinci, Laundry service is outrageously overpriced , Close to Expo clean rooms good b fast fast taxi service Great price just don t get your laundry done there I paid 140 00 for a few shirts pants 
489275,Hotel Da Vinci, Very bad staff dealing not answering to the reception Beds are not clean at all and we could sleep on them Very nosy and you can hear other rooms and who walks in the floor Location are far from Metro Bus station and downtown Not deserve the money that paying for not to be recommended to any one honestly, Free Parking Free Wifi
489276,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Classic original Hotel Best location in the town You will not use any method of transportation Great manager is interested in the comfort of guests 
489277,Hotel Da Vinci, Awesome experience in a hotel which supposedly has 4 stars Horrible welcome at the reception hotel is so big it s likely to be overcrowded elevator and breakfast area the location is also horrible right next to the train station and surrounded by abandoned houses on both sides also the roads are new ant the GPS does not know the right way to this horrible purple castle Rooms are big but seem to be partially furnished there is no information about minibar prices or other important info about the hotel there is no shower curtain so the whole bathroom will be flooded after shower and on top of that there will be some roosters singing you a happy morning song around 7am in the morning , Nothing 
489278,Hotel Da Vinci, made to enter from the rear of the hotel at the car park and had to drag lift suitcases down long steps organized early call and breakfast because catching early flight no call and no breakfast not good enough , reasonably clean and comfortable
489279,Hotel Da Vinci, We ate in the restaurant and whist the food was ok the service was dreadful we only ate a main course as no one came near to see if we wanted anything else and we had to find a waiter to get the bill The head waiter was very nice when I felt unwell but the rest of the staff were totally unorganised We asked for an extra pillow and had to wait 2 nights and only got one when my husband went to reception only to be told by the girl on the desk that he was a liar and it had been delivered , The hotel rooms were spotlessly clean and generously sized The breakfast buffet is superb with a great choice of food Free parking is an added bonus although difficult to find initially There are 2 very helpful polite gentlemen and 1 helpful girl on reception but sadly they are the exception the rest of the staff are at best surly and at worst rude 
489280,Hotel Da Vinci, The hotel is far from a subway station and that subway station is far from town literally at the end of that subway line We went on an early morning tour and tried to get into breakfast area exactly at 0630 start time for breakfast and staff were extremely rude and literally chased us out Staff indicated taxi cost would be 10 but turned out to be 20 unpleasant surprise , Rooms are comfortable stylish and spacious 
489281,Hotel Da Vinci, There was a lack of information given about the hotel s facilities upon check in The desk staff did not advise us there would be a concierge available later in the day for info how to get around and what to see The service in the dining room was not great Our charge account was charged before it should have been which has resulted in an overcharge on our credit card account , The room was lovely and clean Breakfast was good The price was very reasonable Parking was great The location was good 
489282,Hotel Da Vinci, not all rooms are like shown in the pictures specify once you book the room that you would like beds and pillows not very comfy , decorations in the lobby where nice 
489283,Hotel Da Vinci, It s all a question of personal taste of course but I found the decore and colours all in purple ugly , Hotel is clean and pleasant Very spacious rooms Ample free parking Wifi 
489284,Hotel Da Vinci, How the hell get they 4 stars shower drain stopped very noisy not many people speak English breakfast like from an cafeteria no info about hotel on rooms dont bother its not worth the money , Good rooms nice size
489285,Hotel Da Vinci, Unefficiency at the reception desk last an eternity by check in and out Breakdown of the lift while going upstairs with a small child No restaurant opened at noon, The junior suite was nice and spacious
489286,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast was understaffed the staff were doing what they could but were totally overwhelmed we ran out of cups plates cleared tables , Very close to motorway but quiet with secure parking
489287,Hotel Da Vinci, The Staff Was not friendly and not respect the guest when we call for some issue they hang up the phone they not care about the guest by the way its not recomended for any fimaly in the world, Nothing at all
489288,Hotel Da Vinci, Fawlty Towers has nothing on this Location was at least 1 2 hr walk from the train station there was no operational gym spa as advertised we had to move roome twice because the power kept going off water going into bath was brown However the best bit was the restaurant which served improperly cooked stored meat my husband ended up with a severe bowel infection which put him in hospital for a week on our return the ma tre de had the hide to abuse him that he didn t know anything about how meat should be cooked when he complained An all round dreadful experience don t stay there , Not much at all
489289,Hotel Da Vinci, Too much plastic in the hotel Its clearly a conference hotel The bar was far from cosy Had the feeling of a budget hotel, Room was modern clean and spacious and pleasant
489290,Hotel Da Vinci, Restaurant closed in the evening Garden in front of the hotel looks much larger on the picture Gym is still not ready despite of that it is offered on their web sites Location is very strange Almost out of the city with lot of shabby empty buildings next door but with very good approach to the center and airport by metro and train , Hotel is beautiful Art Deco style new reconstructed unfortunately not yet fully Rooms are large and very comfortable Very good breakfast big variety of food Pleasant place in snack bar 
489291,Hotel Da Vinci, Noisy you can hear the tv sound in other rooms and the sound walk in the upper room The reception is not picking the phone Bad bed and dirty pillows and blankets bed sheets No room service No body to help for carrying the luggage Basicly it is bad place in milano , Nothing bad hotel
489292,Hotel Da Vinci, Only one restaurant in the hotel and location of hotel is good if using the train but not good if you want to walk to any restuarant, Staff are friendly and room size very good 
489293,Hotel Da Vinci, location is remote no food or shopping area around management is very strict I had to pay 80 euros for checking out at 3 00 pm , WiFi and modern decoration 
489294,Hotel Da Vinci, The breakfast was all the time too crowdy for the little space people need to wait others leave the table to find a place to have your breakfast , Clean nice rooms a lot of choice at the breakfast
489295,Hotel Da Vinci, The location in the middle of nowhere the train station is noisy when a train stops can t have it all the sound isolation could hear people talking from the parking into my room on the 6th floor with the windows closed as well as my pillow shaking each time my neighbour would close his door the coffee is good enough to put you off from it and no indications for the parking lot so you head for the main entrance and end up going round the horrible concrete towers surrounding the hotel to end in a spooky parking lot overall it s a cheap and badly finished hotel it reminded me a old soviet hotel from the 80s from outside , The room was very well designed very fashionable WiFi parking and breakfast The train station very close to the hotel I wouldn t mind going back but for a cheaper price 
489296,Hotel Da Vinci, The breakfast wasn t too good We had many issues in the morning to have breakfast and it wasn t as good as it should be Hopefully it gets better, Even though the hotel wasn t s five stars hotel the people that they ve been working there such as supervisor and etc they knew how to welcome us to their hotel and treat us Even I saw one this which was shocking but it wasn t a big deal In total everything was good especially the rooms
489297,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Great location big free parking Train station one minute away Breakfast was excelent we obey advise on booking and go to breakfast early to avoid crowd Room comepletely new 
489298,Hotel Da Vinci, Our stay was welcomed with an inability to check in upon arrival The receptionist told me to visit the Milan Expo whilst waiting for 3pm Check In Time I was travelling with my husband and 2 kids under 7 years We had just disembarked from a 12hr Trip from Africa we were exhausted and tired we had to squeeze ourselves on their Lounge Chairs for over 4hours after checking in I found out I had lost my wedding ring in the process of handling 9 Travelling Luggages getting breakfast for my overtly exhausted kids dealing with fatigue , The Rooms have been recently renovated the environment was serene and beautiful 
489299,Hotel Da Vinci, Door was inoperative Had to wait two hours to get in Later I understood the room was intent to be used see image of ceiling Had to pay full price for room 703 ,No Positive
489300,Hotel Da Vinci, check in took quite some time sterile neighbourhood but close to train and subway station, Very spacious rooms very elaborate breakfast though very crowded 
489301,Hotel Da Vinci, nice good service in breakfast small windows and not full open, Location The bathroom it is big and nice for old people quit and nice Free Parking
489302,Hotel Da Vinci, I arrived just after mid night and I was put in a noisy room where I could barely sleep due to the sound of machinery working it seemed to be the central air conditioning or electrical power generator There was a leak under the lavatory and the toilet was not the type I was expecting It may be ok for disable people but for me and the children it was not good at all because the floor was all wet when someone had a bath I asked to be changed and they couldn t offer another room promptly but they did it next day The second room had a far better toilet but it was still noisy and again as I just realized it around 1 am in the morning when the machinery become really louder I also couldn t sleep well on the second night It seemed to me that the staff didn t care about my claim I was so frustrated that I decided to move to other hotel When I asked to talk to the manager the receptionist told me the manager was not available but I noticed she was receiving instructions from someone she was consulting in the office I felt really bad treated that I wanted to leave the hotel as soon as I could My advice to other customers based on my experience avoid the first floor rooms I cannot speak about the rooms on other floors but make sure you check that you can cope with the machinery noise that can be really louder during the night And also I have some reserves about the managing team They didn t show any effort to understand and solve my problem Another problem the room telephones didn t work , The building appearance and decoration I also liked the restaurant 
489303,Hotel Da Vinci, The staff in the restaurant in the evening were disorganised and slow which meant we had a very long wait for dinner At breakfast there were far too many guests for the room or waiting staff which meant it was a chaotic scrum Quality of the food when we got it was good , Facilities of a large hotel but at a very reasonable rate Rooms were very large and access from the motorway excellent 
489304,Hotel Da Vinci, The room had a bad smell on our arrival Even though the design of the room was nice the quality of the making seemed not so good The elevators were undersized so in the time of breakfast you could wait for one to come even five or more minutes The wifi is free of charge however we were not able to connect more than two devices due to the limit , Breakfast was good with many options to choose from The design of the rooms seemed interesting from the pictures and we also got a nice room that was quite newly furbished 
489305,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Everything Just 5 minutes from metro station that drives you directly to the front of Duomo di Milano Friendly staff great breakfast very big and comfortable room and bathroom 
489306,Hotel Da Vinci, More at home in Las Vegas or Atlantic City than in an uninspiring Milan suburb you can t miss it it s big and a subtle shade of purple Just off the A4 motorway in a non descript housing estate the hotel feels more theme park than business stopover or quiet getaway The impressive entrance and grounds are largely wasted as the car park is at the back Check in is painfully slow and there seemed a permanent queue just like Vegas without the gambling to keep you amused while you wait No desk in the room nowhere to hang towels in the bathroom reception areas are funky and minimal with no comfortable seating quiet areas or business center The dining room is more like a vast neon cafeteria than a sedate dining experience The logistics of running a large hotel fail miserably Insufficient reception staff elevators parking and breakfast space are reminiscent of Disney on a bank holiday weekend than a well run hotel , Air conditioned modern and spacious rooms with good bathroom huge comfortable bed and wonderful soft towels 
489307,Hotel Da Vinci, This stay was a nightmare I had booked 3 rooms and we arrived at 3am One of the rooms was occupied with sleeping people I was exhausted after driving for 12 hours and didn t have a room to sleep in They threw a twin mattress on the floor of one of our other rooms and we had to fit 5 people into a room that was reserved for only 3 We were refunded for the room that had people in it but not for the room that I slept on the floor The staff was rude I asked to speak to the manager and was not given the name contact information or appointment time I could come back to talk to the manager After paying thousands of dollars to come to Europe this was not the experience I was looking for I am extremely disappointed with my experience at this hotel , Breakfast buffet was good The hotel appeared clean It was close to old Milan The good does not come close to compensating for the extremely bad experience I had with this hotel 
489308,Hotel Da Vinci, Hotel has was renovated 4 months back and there are no proper board directions shown near Hotel Staff assured that everything is still under planning and will soon be updated New inexperienced staff On weekend when I was there Hotel was almost full and inspite of 4 5 people on desk it was taking up to 20 min waiting time Local Underground station about 12 min walking distance away , Rooms were large and clean Large variety of Breakfast Enough Parking Large lawn etc 
489309,Hotel Da Vinci, This was by far the worst breakfast experience ever on a hotel We felt like livestock in a barn being fed with random leftovers , Parking had guards which felt good considering the neighbourhood 
489310,Hotel Da Vinci, The derelict tower blocks photo edited out of your hotel advert Hopefully they will be gone soon , Very easy to find and accessible for all major routes airports 
489311,Hotel Da Vinci, The breakfast room was overcrowded and staff overwhelmed One day people had to wait to get a table there were no cups for coffee left and some of the food ran out and it took long time until it was replenished Not a good way to start your day Second day was a bit better but if you want a quiet breakfast you better go somewhere else Despite having 4 lifts there was usually a queue They seemed to be slow operating maybe one or two was out of order Used the staircase manytimes , Ideal for those travelling by car free parking and close to the metro if you want to use it Large rooms compared to the other 6 hotels I stayed in during this Italy trip While the colors and design of the furnishings used in rooms and building might not be to everyones taste I liked the change 
489312,Hotel Da Vinci, We booked a modern room and got an old bavarian style room The room was lovely but completely different from the photos of the room booked , Good staff confortable rooms 
489313,Hotel Da Vinci, Slow check in and check out Old and crowded elevators No shower curtain get ready to flood the bathroom , The size of the room was great and the free and secure parking was a big plus for travelers with car 15 minutes walk from metro station 
489314,Hotel Da Vinci, The location it is far from every thing 10 15 minutes to metro You need a car to go to a grocery store Far from the city center Some Staff need more training no help with bags , 
489315,Hotel Da Vinci, Towel rails missing the drive way to the hotel is closed and most people carry their luggage down the stairs into the Hotel The breakfast has a good selection but the way It is organised is not efficient The staff in the dinner restaurant is completely incompetent and disorganised The tables get not cleared efficiently after customers leave hence no tables are ready for new customers The food was ok by staff had a long time to take orders and needed to be reminded to bring bread salt pepper cheese , The rooms are good sized the design is basic but useable One point to winge about is there is only one hook for the towels In the shower That s for all towels
489316,Hotel Da Vinci, Both the interior and exterior design are terrible This place should hire an architect to improve it The bed was pretty hard Breakfast was nice but as there were a lot of guests eating at the same time it was complicated to find the table They ran out of some meals every 20 minutes Coffee from the machine was pretty bad The food quality in the restaurant was very poor and overpriced , This hotel is situated in a good position towards Expo and RHO Fierra perfect for travelers with car Rooms were clean service was nice Parking was FREE 
489317,Hotel Da Vinci, It was difficult to find the Hotel as the Sat Nav only takes you to the road and the hotel is rather tucked away they could make their signs directing to the hotel more obvious, The rooms are very large as was the bed Super King and very comfortable Hotel is bright and modern located just off the motorway 
489318,Hotel Da Vinci, Breakfast on the Sunday was chaotic as the hotel was fully booked was informed there were about 800 guests So we ended up with no table so a long time there was no system Would have been nice if someone was controlling the guests flow rather than for us to fight for a table The following day was much better as the hotel was not so full anymore Will still need some sort of system nevertheless The walk to the Metro Station was a bit of a trek for my Mum who has trouble walking Would be nice if the hotel offers free shuttle to Metro for the guests The lift None existent basically as it never stops on our floor so we always ended up taking the stairs even with all our luggage Don t know if they were working as there was no indication on where it is etc , Bedroom is a very good size aircon works well bed is super comfy and the shower toilet is quite good too Breakfast is included with many options available Free parking It was not perfect but the hotel offers great value for money Near enough to get to the centre of Milan good if you are visiting Lake Como as well as it is a short drive away from here Will definitely come back 
489319,Hotel Da Vinci, There was a call at early morning from arabic talking persons From the stuff disturbed us alot of people for the place, The intirior desighn of the hotel
489320,Hotel Da Vinci, It s a little bit outside the center but there are 2 stations close to the hotel The elevators are very slow and unreliable, The Staff at the reception was very friendly and helpful They fulfiled my wish to get a room in an upper floor The room was very clean
489321,Hotel Da Vinci, Bizzare design of the hotel No glasses in the room and no place for drying towels, Huge room Nice shower Lot of free parking space lot of signs no problem to find it Very close to Expo 10 min by car 
489322,Hotel Da Vinci, Room door sound insulation is non existent Trains do not go that often and not too late at least Twice in an hour and a couple of trains later in the night Breakfast is noisy and industrial like feeding place , New Hotel Quite clean Close to train to Milan center 
489323,Hotel Da Vinci, no shower curtain , 1 nice spacious rooms well done up 2 nice garden in the property 3 great value for money if you have a car which I did 15 min to the center I did not need to use public transport but it did not appear to be convenient 
489324,Hotel Da Vinci, I loved everything , This hotel is amazing The food is excellent My son and I are vegans The hotel caters to vegans It was a pleasure to eat vegan croissants It is situated not far from the highway and the train to downtown Milan I definitely recommend Hotel Da Vinci 
489325,Hotel Da Vinci, Bathrooms weren t cleaned very nicely No replacement soap shampoo Couldn t get hold of reception from hotel phone or room service Had to call from my cell phone Not enough seats for breakfast poor capacity demand management , Great beds Spacious rooms Lovely decor and very nice bathroom WiFi was good Free parking 
489326,Hotel Da Vinci, Restaurant in the evening was bedlam and they were completely understaffed however the restaurant manager was very good and explained the situation on arrival so we were prepared for a wait , Easy access and short walk to underground direct to the centre of Milan Good parking which seemed to be manned and fairly secure 
489327,Hotel Da Vinci, Rooms could have been cleaned better especially the spiders on roof , Good hotel close to metro station free parking big nice rooms Well decorated 
489328,Hotel Da Vinci, Toilet flush of our room was malfunctioning , We stayed there with our 2 children during our family vacation on Europe tour Staff was very helpful and nice Food was good as well and best part is the colour and ambience of the hotel 
489329,Hotel Da Vinci, The restaurant in the hotel is very poor the service is very bad Make sure to check your bill The location is awful don t feel safe outside at night , Nice big bed 
489330,Hotel Da Vinci, Overly crowded at breakfast and getting a free table was tricky Probably due to expo going around , Location was quit convenient for public transportation S4 includes free parking with wide variety of choices for breakfast Overall a very good value for money 
489331,Hotel Da Vinci, 2 time staying here and the Pets from other guest are toooo loud breakfast time is just a chaos not enough table for such big hotel fighting to get a table and only 1 coffe machine for all guests available , Room are big clean and confortable
489332,Hotel Da Vinci, Terrible location for the Milan Expo if not driving Yes you have a metro station within 13 min walk and a train station next door BUT to go to the Expo you have to go all the way into the city to get the link to the Expo No fitness facilities , Bedroom was really spacious clean and modern Breakfast was epic Staff was very helpful

489334,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Very nice rooms Great staff I checked in before the official check in time and the staff Andrea went out of his way to get me a room despite being almost fully booked I also had an issue with my visa card and the management still checked me in as I sorted the same out despite requirement for upfront payment Good Breakfast Reliable WiFi
489335,Hotel Da Vinci, Staff not cooperative don t do good cleaning and no insects and mosquito control in the rooms No entrance from the front had to come from the back door Breakfast was so crowded each day staff break dishes because of heavy tray Don t have cart for transferring used dishes TV Chanel s with no English chanls and so many porn Chanels not restricted Metro station not used had to walk for 1 2 km for the bus station Adjacent building are not occupied and look scary , Room was big free wifi and parking area 
489336,Hotel Da Vinci,No Negative, Far from center but it s not problem Railway station is 200 m from hotel and 800 m underground 20 min to Duom Very nice hotel Perfect breakfast and parking free it s very important 
489337,Hotel Da Vinci, We were in this Hotel for 2 nights from 11th July till 13th to visit Milan and Expo2015 Choose this Hotel because on Booking com was discount and close to Expo First my impression was that staff in check in desk couldn t organize check in fast There were lot of people and worked answered on phones and so on only 2 girls So we waited prox 40 min to make check in For big 4 stars Hotel its incredible long After check in came to room and the room was so dirtily Like in Motel we lived in high floor room 805 Especially bath We asked to clean and walk away to visit Milan came late night the room was still dirty We fought probably they will clean at morning But it didn t happen Dirty was not only in room in breakfast room too And staff were rude I give to this Hotel 2 stars maximum and probably this Hotel should check some sanitary Inspection Because such dirtiness could infect someone Its not safety to stay in this Hotel P S When we check out I asked about some book where could I write about it or call head manager to leave complaint but guy on reception ignore my request ,No Positive

489341,Hotel Da Vinci, We enjoyed our stay in this hotel nothing to complain Except the restaurant staff we had a feeling that they were not glad to see guests in their place Service there was very poor Food was delicious but prices are above the average For these money you expect at least warm plates and good service , The first impression when you come into hotel was so warm and friendly Ladies who welcome and staff were very helpful in any questions Special thank to Ms Valeria at reception she made our stay even better If you travel by car great place to stay
