138470,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, I love the location of this hotel It is right off of Earl s Court Rd and a stone s throw to the Earl s Court tube station There is a pub at the corner and a number of restaurants and other shops right on Earl s Court Rd I will always stay here if there is a free room on my London visits 
138471,Henley House Hotel, Nothing was bad but I thought we would receive a hot breakfast but the continental breakfast was very nice regardless , The room I stayed in was very nice and modern and had amazing lighting The staff were very helpful friendly and attentive Overall a great experience and hope to go back again in the near future 
138472,Henley House Hotel, Porter upon arrival Had to change rooms had a veiw of 4 walls and paid extra for the room change And one of us had to sleep on a sofa bed We needed 2 beds Not enough electrical outlets or adapters Breakfast was terrible They even scorched the capppacino And the Italian restaurant wasn t much better for dinner, The service at the Italian restarant
138473,Henley House Hotel, Bathroom was tiny so tiny that a larger person will have difficulties using the facilities , Staff was kind professional very helpful in assisting with information
138474,Henley House Hotel, No hot water for 2 days with no apology or correction on the bill No place to store clothes or suitcases in the room Air conditioner intermittently worked , Decent breakfast 
138475,Henley House Hotel, Aircon went off overnight and London was in a heatwave so sleeping was difficult due to heat build up , Great room lovely little balcony overlooking a cute park Nice breakfast and fab location 
138476,Henley House Hotel, Since rooms are so small access to breakfast room during day would have been convenient , Although typical small London room it was modern and well laid out with nice view of back garden Frig in room was convenient Good continental breakfast in garden conservatory Very close to great access tube station Earls Court 
138477,Henley House Hotel, Nothing, Great location short walk from the train station Staff were very friendly The bed was very comfortable Shower pressure was reasonable Bathroom was small but has all that we needed 
138478,Henley House Hotel, The shower jet could be stronger and tall single travelers would have felt a bit cramped in the bathroom I am small so no problem , The hotel was conveniently located near Earls Court station and near bus stations Many restaurants and shops are around if you are hungry or need something at short notice Staff is incredibly nice and helpful Breakfast is fine Though I had a room to the street it was incredibly quiet in the night no traffic noise at all 
138479,Henley House Hotel, Bed was quite hard Breakfast not very successful plenty of seeded rolls but no croissants either morning of our stay coffee machine also broken on second morning , Although small the room was well equipped and very clean 
138480,Henley House Hotel, Breakfast finish at 0900 which we and other guests found a little early for vacation makers Staff in the breakfast was so eager to clean and close In my view hotel will benefit a lot from Better hospitality communication skills and good old manners to match the great facilities they have Why not to get an old hotelier from a respectable hotel to train the staff , Quiet location facing Barkson gardens small balcony refurbished new room of appropriate size for twin beds clean relatively spacious bathroom great fluffy towels bathrobes airconditioner quiet elevator available tea coffee facilities fridge with complimentary water only one bottle through for a twin room Excellent and highly recommended restaurant TheoSimplyItalian just next door was a discovery after all day Chelsea Flower show Restaurant is highly recommended for a supper or lunch with award winning chef doing reasonable priced Italian cooking Locals and Italians approve the food Try antipasti and hot starters Cook book is also available Hotel is close to the tube station 5 min walk 
138481,Henley House Hotel, Our fault probably but the bathroom was a wee bit small, A very neat and spotless hotel easy walk to the attractions of Kensington and very close to underground
138482,Henley House Hotel, Room VERY small Marks on pillows so not very clean Breakfast room tiny and not enough variety in the food The charming employee had trouble keeping up with table cleaning at peak time and all crumbs were wiped off the tables onto the floor Definitely an overpriced hotel even by London standards , Modern and central Practical 2 min walk from earls court tube 
138483,Henley House Hotel, The breakfast could provide some egg options such as sunny side up other than just boiled and raw ones , Love the location it s proximity to supermarkets and earls court metro station It s a relatively safe Neighbourhood 
138484,Henley House Hotel, The room needed some space for toiletries in the bathroom and the bed needed a new mattress as the springs were able to be felt The staff added a duvet so it did become less uncomfortable , The room was very well appointed the location couldn t have been better and the staff was wonderful 
138485,Henley House Hotel, Just needs a socket near the bedside table for phone charging , High quality townhouse hotel Very modern and well maintained rooms Great for overnight stay 
138486,Henley House Hotel, 1 I had requested a room on high floor when making a reservation but they gave me a basement room I was very disappointed 2 Water pressure in the shower room and toilet was too low even toilet didn t flush , 1 location close to subway station 2 breakfast was good 3 room was clean
138487,Henley House Hotel, Single rooms are the worst I have ever stayed in so far Very very small room not even enough space to put luggage uncomfortable old mattress small bed surrounded by two walls which means you cannot sleep with your legs stretched and have to sleep on your side The bathroom is so tiny that you don t even have space to use the toilet Water pressure is so weak that you cannot even take a decent shower Breakfast starts at 7 30 too late for people who need to get out of the hotel early , Modern rooms Reception stuff are nice and helpful Location is perfect close to earls court station and many restaurants near by Quiet room with nice view Breakfast is good 
138488,Henley House Hotel, Room very small But with everything Carpet on the floor , The position of the hotel and there was a good atmosphere Room very clean and this is a rarety for London 
138489,Henley House Hotel, I was very happy to be in a ground floor room as I have a broken leg but lots of passage from reception to stairs and lift Once that settled down I spent a quiet night but the lovely ladies who organise the breakfast chat very loudly in the morning , Very comfortable bed Small but really nice shower room good water pressure spotlessly clean I liked the room good amenities nice decor Full length mirror iron and board multi socket for charging or using electronic devices plus a small fridge are thoughtful extras Reception staff are very friendly and welcoming The situation very near to transport and shops restaurants etc yet in a leafy London square is perfect 
138490,Henley House Hotel, Wi fi network was hit and miss , Great room in a great location Staff were friendly and responsive Although the room was small it had everything you d need for a business trip 
138491,Henley House Hotel, If you are a new couple or didn t really feel comfortable with each other mind that we got a room with bathroom behind the glass wall Blinds didn t close all the way which was pretty uncomfortable Room is really small but for this price I don t think there is anything better in this great area , Everything was great except bathroom behind the glass wall 
138492,Henley House Hotel, Small lift, The location of this hotel was superb for our needs 5 minutes walk from Earls Court Tube and 30 minutes walk to the Albert Hall The photos on the website were a very accurate picture of the hotel The room was small but perfectly formed with a great view over the square I would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to others 
138493,Henley House Hotel, Deluxe room very uncomfortably small Single room size with double bed which took up all of the room space , Clean room good breakfast great location 
138494,Henley House Hotel, Ambiguous description not what it looks like online rooms are too small compared ro similar priced properties mediocre breakfast choice more a hostel than a hotel , Cleanliness Location 
138495,Henley House Hotel, Room was very small with not much storage space to meet our needs , Great location quiet street yet only 150 metres from Earls Court Underground shops and restaurants Very modern room clean with all required facilities 
138496,Henley House Hotel, For me it was ideal but the bathroom was tiny but had everything I needed but might be a challenge for some, Lovely room very clean and fresh Breakfast was very good too
138497,Henley House Hotel, 1 We were provided room in the basement first when we wanted to move out we were given a room on 3rd floor 2 Bathroom is too small so is the lift claustrophobic feeling, The room size was good so was breakfast 
138498,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, Very very nice and perfect position nearly the tube and bus stop Pubs and restaurants around Very friendly staff Good breakfast The room was clean 
138499,Henley House Hotel, The breakfast could ve been better although it s correct , I like the modern comfy bedrooms lovely decorated The staff is nice and the location perfect The hotel is very near of the tube Piccadilly Line and District very handful for shopping and walks 
138500,Henley House Hotel, Nothing, The breakfast is excellent rooms clean very comfortable Staff all lovely My first stay here but for my daughter who was with me it is her third stay hoping to be back next month
138501,Henley House Hotel, The room we ve stayed in Nr 34 was really small which for our 1 night stay was fine but if you are planning to spend some time here this is not the right place Bathroom is super modern but not large The mattress was disappointing cheap and cheerful instead of a quality mattress , The hotel is in a good location in London right in Earls Court which is great and close to many things We knew we d arrive late and post lobby close so I rang up and informed the property who re assured me that the night porter will hold our key and will have all the details for us wifi password etc arranged in our room 
138502,Henley House Hotel, Some rooms are on the small side Fine for a solo traveller but a couple would find it a bit cramped , Design conscious comfort conscious and all at a very reasonable price for this part of London 
138503,Henley House Hotel, Shower stall a little small and the door is a little hard to use when getting out Rooms on the whole are a little small however this is in line with the competition As others have noted soundproofing from other rooms floors could be better No gym or additional facilities , Room design is fantastic and kooky TV screens massive Shower had good water pressure and distribution from the shower head Bed very comfortable nice and hard pillows new and also comfortable Staff helpful and accommodating but perhaps not expected to be concierges Location as noted excellent due to proximity to tube station and bus stops 
138504,Henley House Hotel, The breakfast was somehow basic we would have enjoyed an English breakfast The rooms and length of the beds are a bit small especially the single one 43 it may not be a problem unless you are tall but you should inform in advance Then I am not sure the cleaning was done properly Shampoos soap were replaced and towels too but there were hair remaining in the shower and on the floor in the bathroom and finally the air conditionning was a bit Noisy These are information for improvements but we would be happy to come back , We enjoyed the hotel and rooms modern and comfortable newly refurbished Very well equipped free wifi and nice attention with an international charger 
138505,Henley House Hotel, I m 5 ft 9 in tall and the bed felt really really short because of the room layout bed stuck between walls , Excellent location on a quiet street but still close to tube station Nice clean room Friendly staff and ok breakfast 
138506,Henley House Hotel, The do not disturb maid service electronic system also appears to serve as a night light I had to sellotape a piece of card over it to make the room dark enough to sleep in One of the blinds was broken in our room Hairdryer installed in the bathroom is very slow , Staff pleasant helpful breakfast nice 
138507,Henley House Hotel, My room was not exactly on the fourth floor but the small lift enough for one person and one big luggage went highest to 4th I didn t mind so much but when I got out to the smallest of corridors there were huge bags of laundry on the floor making it even more difficult to squeeze my way out of the lift with my luggage and onto the mini stairs to my room I wouldn t blame the hotel but I could hear my fellow neighbours slamming doors from inside my room But these were mini problems for me I had good night s sleep for the two nights I was there , I liked the location Very near to Earls Court station cross walk a bit turn left walk a bit more and voila Piccadilly line always good for airport and central London locations Many restaurants nearby and there s an M S food hall few hundred metres away Convenient stores also available Breakfast was held in the conservatory nice touch Interacted with the receptionists who were helpful and friendly Bed was comfy and I had a nice view of the garden park outside Shower had a nice pressure of hot water Tea coffee in room 
138508,Henley House Hotel, Bed was lumpy and bathroom was too small They could have easily made the room a bit smaller and the bathroom a little bigger , Great location although there are a lot more hotels in this street so not really a unique selling point Nice spacious room that has been renovated recently 
138509,Henley House Hotel, As noted by other reviewers the heating is a little noisy and erratic , Spacious for London room recently renovated Staff were friendly and helpful 
138510,Henley House Hotel, Room too small the bed was almost like a cot bed Toilet and shower were almost unusable being so cramped and the shower had almost no power of water flow Noisy and Air con went from v hot to v cold periodically , Clean modern and easy to access location with underground 3 mins away and very many eating establishments close by 
138511,Henley House Hotel, Breakfast finished at 9am not ideal while on holiday so only eat there on the day we were leaving early for train Knew the room would be small which was fine for us and bigger than expected however the bathroom was tiny , Very clean comfortable room Great location in quiet street Staff were welcoming
138512,Henley House Hotel, The wifi could have been better I did find it difficult to respond to emails , Excellent location very comfortable and quiet hotel handy for the museums and close to many bars restaurants and the tube
138513,Henley House Hotel, I found the air conditioning heater unit quite noisy I am quite a light sleeper and it was just disturbing me So I switched it off but then I woke up in the night quite cold I m sure other would not have a problem with this , The receptionist was really friendly The room was lovely It was nicely set out and I loved the fact that there were big fluffy dressing gowns 
138514,Henley House Hotel, The only issue is the heating We were there in January and they have an air con type set up This is set by default to automatic when the room gets to a certain temperature the air con then kicks in to cold mode and it was freezing in the room , This hotel is in a great location literally a 2 minute walk away from Earl court station Lovely area very quiet and staff so helpful Will be back
138515,Henley House Hotel, Our room was located on the first floor In the morning there were two delivery men throwing large boxes down and having a conversation on the stairs right by our window It was very loud and woke us up but that was the only downside to our stay Everything else was great , Really friendly staff very clean comfortable great location good breakfast We loved our room and bathroom We definitely will be staying there again 
138516,Henley House Hotel, Ridiculously small room a bathroom so tiny that one could barely turn around very uncomfortable bed poor breakfast no English breakfast blow dryer is from a past century We had a balcony but only to find out that it was shared with the neighbour room so no privacy there But the worst were the PAPER THIN WALLS We could literally hear every word and step from the neighbours a group of young girls who were additionally to the super thin walls very loud until 5am Was not a nice experience , Friendly staff clean rooms nice location close to Earls Court underground station which gets you to the city centre in no time
138517,Henley House Hotel, No parking available Small room with small bath , Proximity to museums and tube Very nice neighbourhood newly furnished interior and very good breakfast 
138518,Henley House Hotel, Very small rooms It was difficult with a large suitcase as there was no room to put it had to put under desk which made it hard to access Bathroom also very small An average sized person would have to turn sideways and squeeze past sink to get in shower, Excellent staff very helpful Very clean modern with all the needed amenities Proximity to Earl s Court metro Marks Spencer s market Paul s cafe Nero s coffee was a bonus 
138519,Henley House Hotel, Shower head was broken Temperature of water was erratic Room was too compact Breakfast choice was disappointing for the money , TV proximity comfy bed clean elegant modern decor 
138520,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, Stars over the bed The swish modern gadgetry made life very easy The splendid white robes and sumptuous towels all gave our stay a luxurious bonus Continental Breakfas t too turned out to good healthy fun boiled eggs especially 
138521,Henley House Hotel, Room was the size of a shoe box bed length was from wall to wall I couldn t stretch and had to lay in semi curl position If you are over 5 10 you will struggle Breakfast was very poor, The proximity of tybe station 
138522,Henley House Hotel, The stools in the breakfast room are not comfortable at all crazy to have these , Modern well equipped bedrooms Nice breakfast room simple but good breakfast Located close to Earls court tube on a quiet side street 
138523,Henley House Hotel, The room size was smaller than expected however I did get a single room , Staff were friendly breakfast had a good selection and it was a good location to high street 
138524,Henley House Hotel, The walls and floors the windows give a clear indication what is going on in the next rooms or outside , well breakfast Obviously these Brits simply do not know it any better But for UK really okay 
138525,Henley House Hotel, Air con to work next time little frustrating had to keep the window open and was noisy, Staff were extra friendly and pleasant and dressed the room for an occasion small touches made a perfect stay Keep up the good work
138526,Henley House Hotel, The bed was comfortable for me but for a taller person 180 and up it must be a challenge to sleep comfortable The water pressure was very bad The wifi kept dropping no matter which wifi I connected to Even though there is an elevator it doesn t cover all the way to the room I still needed to carry my suitcase on narrow stairs The hotel website said you can use a gym for reduced price however this turned out to be outdated information that they missed to remove from the website You can hear conversations happening and doors closing in nearby rooms , Good location walking distance from museums Victoria and Albert Museum of Nature and Science close to metro restaurants and grocery stores around the corner I stayed in a single room that was very small but still quite functional and clean The breakfast was not wide selection but nice The bed was comfortable the room was warm 
138527,Henley House Hotel, Toilet seat cover was a bit sideways , I liked all of it Location was great and nearby Earl s Court underground station Area was nice and not too loud Room was spotless and comfortable Especially bed was really comfy and steady The best surprise for me was that hairdryer was in the bathroom and was really good It keeps the actual room much cleaner cos no hairs on the carpet Breakfast was a pleasant surprise after some reviews because there was good products and it was enough amount of choices to start our days well Also the breakfast room was really tidy 
138528,Henley House Hotel, The reception area needs to look more welcoming Better sitting down options Brighter friendlier colours , Excellent breakfast and clean modern room Friendly staff and excellent location 2 min walk to tube station Shops and pubs close by 
138529,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, We loved everything about this hotel great location close to pubs restaurants walking distance to tube The room was modern and funky spacious and comfortable Breakfast room was delightful and a lovely brekky was complimentary I left my kindle in the room and staff made the effort to contact me and return it to me in Australia Recommend highly 
138530,Henley House Hotel, The shower had only one temperature scalding hot , Spotlessly clean comfortable room Attention to detail providing excellent facilities for guests I liked the dressing gown and spare adapter plug in a small bag on the door Staff were friendly and helpful 
138531,Henley House Hotel, My room on the fourth floor was very noisy couldn t work out what it was but there was a constant mechanical noise throughout the night maybe air con units or extractor fans or something The breakfast was very basic The reception staff were quite disengaged but I always find London hotel staff to be like that , The room was miniature but very cleverly structured had nice modern decor Black out blind was a bonus as were the sweets at reception 
138532,Henley House Hotel, Way too much overpriced for a very tiny room small double bed and a pretty basic breakfast The hot water wasn t hot but just warm almost at the limit of feeling cold while taking a shower I would only book again if the price was at least half of what I paid , Kind and helpful staff Modern room and cool interior design Awesome and quiet location 
138533,Henley House Hotel, The breakfast was quite basic but it depends if that matters to you , I booked on the day so got a reduced rate which was excellent value for money The bed was comfortable and the room was clean and modern as was the bathroom The breakfast was ok I would definitely stay there again 
138534,Henley House Hotel, Nothing to fault , Excellent throughout Nice welcome efficient and friendly staff modern clean room and shower nicely furnished very comfortable Good breakfast in pleasant conservatory Have stayed twice before and would return again Would highly recommend 
138535,Henley House Hotel, Only issue is room size Very small for a longer stay Small balcony helped expand the space , Great location Helpful staff and well maintained clean facilities Lots of care went into the place
138536,Henley House Hotel, missed one breakfast one morning would be better if extended to 10 am every day , staff were very helpful polite Very quite location and good location to get to central attractions 
138537,Henley House Hotel, The bed for me was on the hard side but just suitable for the wife , Excellent location Piccadilly Line from Heathrow and District Line 300 m away Pleasantly modern Enough space to keep two big suitcases open on the floor at night good Kettle coffee tea and also a fridge Good lights in the room and washroom Friendly and helpful staff You yourself cook your breakfast egg good 
138538,Henley House Hotel, The room was a bit small and the lift didn t inspire much confidence , This is a funky hotel with an Art Deco feel Variation of lights very good for a different experience The bathroom modern and effective 
138539,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, They staff were very friendly The hotel was close to city transportation to get around town Hotel was close to restaurants Hotel was in a quiet but safe area Overall I enjoyed my stay here 
138540,Henley House Hotel, Room is a little bit narrow , Location is very good near by Earl s Court Sta Room facilities are very comfortable Also it s so clean Free wifi is good condition 
138541,Henley House Hotel, Beds were too firm hair dryer was weak , Loved the remodeled rooms modern styling continental breakfast the lift air conditioning USB plugs and windows that opened Also they kept our luggage while we traveled to Scotland 
138542,Henley House Hotel, the rooms were very small not like the pictures on the website breakfast area was also very small which made it difficult to Que up and get your cereals when i used the lift it was full of dustbin liners with rubbish inside it was ok for business but wouldn t stay for more than a night, rooms were nice and clean and looks like they have been refurbished recently
138543,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, Croissants for breakfast were very delicious Hotel has great design Very arty yet modern Service at reception was exceptional Great location and bed very comfortable 
138544,Henley House Hotel, The coffee machine was broken so the only coffee available was drip filter or instant In other hotels I have stayed in their emergency set up would be offering small cafetiere to the patrons At less than 5 per cafeti re 3 per 300g of Lavazza fresh group coffee it would be an easy situation to cope with It appeared that most of the patrons on the 12 tables were disappointed with the drip filter coffee option like me I opted for plain hot water The meats at breakfast were v rubbery tasteless There was no drinking water in our room The mini fridge was overheating , The bed was very comfy The type of pillows to select on the bed were perfect The a c option was perfect as not only did it cool down the room but it also drowned out the noise outside so we had a perfect night s sleep Wifi strength was v good It never cut out The bread rolls at breakfast were excellent 
138545,Henley House Hotel, The beds were not very comfortable The bread for breakfast could have been better e g from a bakery They seemed to use bakeoff bread that was not perfectly baked , Nicely decorated rooms The staff was polite and welcoming 
138546,Henley House Hotel, I was not a fan of breakfast could easily leave it The fridge in the room is not really much colder than room temperature , I was very impressed with the location and helpfulness of the staff Small rooms but standard for London hotels and very well furnished I am a frequent visitor to London and this is definitely one of the best value hotels 
138547,Henley House Hotel, The rest of the hotel is aging breakfast is poor and very bad soundproofing you feel like your neighbors are in your room , The bed was comfy and rooms are clean
138548,Henley House Hotel, Nothing significant , Small but comfortable and most importantly the bathroom is clean and kept clean throughout our stay Close to tube station which is excellent 
138549,Henley House Hotel, My wife would have liked more storage room for clothes The hotel would probably not be a good choice for people with mobility issues , The hotel was on a quiet street It had great access to the Underground and Heathrow The employees were very friendly and helpful 
138550,Henley House Hotel, Breakfast was disappointing We had to cook the eggs ourselves The selection was very limited , Our room was modern and spacious and the mattresses were very comfortable The hotel provided a power adapter for our devices The Underground station Earl s Court is just around the corner 
138551,Henley House Hotel, Needs a kettle in the room the bar fridge did not get very cold , Central 3 min walk to Gaite Metro Rooms clean staff friendly Lots of shops nearby Will stay again
138552,Henley House Hotel, Nothing, Great location and the most friendly reception people Breakfast was lovely in the outer veranda and the rooms were very modern Would definitely stay there again
138553,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, Breakfast was advertised as Continental so we expected just bread maybe a croissant and coffee It was a pleasant surprise to have eggs cereal cheese and ham etc We also liked the simplicity of the decor and the cleanliness 
138554,Henley House Hotel, The room was compact about 12 inches from bed end to wall Hard pillows Weak shower, Just a short walk from Earls Court tube Rooms are new fresh clean with good lighting Huge flat screen TV
138555,Henley House Hotel, Make the breakfast more healthy please , Perfect location 2min from Earl s Court st Marksspencer pub tesco restau 10min walk to High St Ken Fashion and whole foods Street is very quiet at night Tiny park in front of hotel Excellent wifi Lovely staff
138556,Henley House Hotel, Breakfast choices were very limited , Location was brilliant just round corner from Earls Court tube shops and restaurants yet view of a beautiful park Hotel decor was very modern and fresh 
138557,Henley House Hotel, No plug ins by head of bed which is inconvenient for cell phones That s basically the only thing we didn t like , Convenient to everything On a nice quiet side street Always clean Staff friendly and helpful Nice breakfast Beds comfortable 
138558,Henley House Hotel, The walls are wafer thin When you want to catch up with the news at night your next door neighbour will come knocking on your door House keeping is quite sloppy for the rates they are charging , The location is good That s all 
138559,Henley House Hotel, Breakfast was a little ordinary but sufficient enough, We loved the modern room Despite its small size it was quite comfortable The bathrobes were amazing and the bed really comfortable The location was great very close to Earls Court train station and Hyde Park We easily got around and into the city centre of London to visit the sites 
138560,Henley House Hotel, There was nowhere to sit in our room except on the bed A slightly larger room with a loveseat and or chair would have been better Also the breakfast room is extremely uncomfortable There are tiny little stools to sit on without back support , Henley House is conveniently located near the Earl Gray tube stop It is in a quiet neighborhood and the staff is GREAT 
138561,Henley House Hotel, Nothing , Everything Staff were very polite and extremely helpful Quick check in and lovely continental free breakfast Room was big room 1 and very modern with up to date lighting They even have international adapter sin our room if we needed them We will be back thank you 
138562,Henley House Hotel, The bed could do with a better mattress , Staff were very good and the breakfast was lovely the room was really nice let down a bit by the bed 
138563,Henley House Hotel, Quite expensive I felt we paid 300 for one night, Beautiful hotel great location staff were wonderful perfect for a short stay rooms are really small but gorgeous 
138564,Henley House Hotel, bed was too small and hard room too pokey breakfast was very uninspiring boiled eggs sliced processed cheese a dark meat did not look like ham cheap packaged jam apples and oranges dull croissants were ok it was not that expensive but you can still serve a more interesting breakfast i think , it was quiet apart from a pipe that seemed to knock against the outside wall which was remedied by shutting the window coffee was good for a machine 
138565,Henley House Hotel, The room provided is very small I needed to do exercises to help my hip I found it almost impossible to lie on the floor to do these , The staff are very helpful and friendly 
138566,Henley House Hotel, The room we was in is definitely not made for two people and should be sold as a single It s lovely and was clean the bed was ok but made uncomfortable because it had to sleep two when in fact it should just sleep one Even though it was lovely I would recommend it sold as a single only The continental breakfast was good but could be made better with more variety and options for guest but the staff were still very accommodating and helpful , The staff were extra helpful and friendly We came for birthday celebrations for my husband and for our wedding anniversary I did inform the hotel and Jake decorated the room and put chocolates in there for my husband which was a lovely touch and unexpected but gravely appreciated 
138567,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, Charming hotel in an excellent location just a short distance from the Underground station The staff at the front desk were very friendly and helpful

138574,Henley House Hotel, If I had one complaint it would be that the pillows were a bit too hard but that s it , The location outlook room and general areas of this beautiful boutique hotel were all excellent We loved it and would definitely recommend it 
138575,Henley House Hotel, Shower gel and body lotion not supplied, Room very well appointed but bathroom shower only and a little small Location very good for getting around London and to Wimnlefon for tennis Breakfast good but stop serving at 9am weekdays which I feel is a little early

138582,Henley House Hotel, Nothing , Fantastic location Super staff Very modern room small but comfortable Nice breakfast Did I say super staff Would definitely return 
138583,Henley House Hotel, I found my room to be quite noisy and small The breakfast was only so so It is very unclear to me why this is a 4 star hotel I would classify it as 2 1 2 3 star hotel , Nice location very convenient access to trains and airport 
138584,Henley House Hotel, breakfast was not the greatest it was continental breakfast which is fine but there was not much of a selection Also some rooms have glass walls and thats what we requested but did not get that but it was not a problem , A lovely small cosey hotel rooms are pretty small but we only stayed 1 night so it was not an issue as we didnt have much luggage 
138585,Henley House Hotel, The single room was almost too small but managable, Excellent location walking distance from Earl s Court Tube station and many restaurant and shops Very clean and modern Lovely staff who were very friendly and helpful 
138586,Henley House Hotel, Nothing staying here was a very pleasant experience , The staff were really nice I arrived early and needed to drop a bag off the chap behind reception went and checked to see if the room was ready which it was so he let me check in early and put the bag in the room at 12 00 really good customer service Room was small but well designed with some nice design touches bed was comfy and the breakfast was perfect 
138587,Henley House Hotel, nothing serious, room and bath s style new and modern kindness of the whole staff both at the reception and at breakfast room the quiet and position very close to the Tube Earl s Court 
138588,Henley House Hotel, Very small bathroom was just a little bit tight for space , Very comfortable room with pleasant balcony overlooking garden square Extremely helpful and friendly staff 
138589,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, Evening staff provided a breakfast so we could leave early good croissants Neat small room but perfectly adequate for 1 night Newly decorated and very clean Very near to Eals Court Station and buses 
138590,Henley House Hotel, Very limited breakfast no cooked option and no explanation of how to use some of the fancy gadgets in the room there were sparkly lights in the ceiling that must ve looked like stars but we had no instructions on how to turn them on Also our deluxe room was small I would have hated to have seen a standard room , Luxurious fixtures and fittings difficult in such a small space fantastic tv and location perfect for the tube or taxis Hotel staff couldn t have been more helpful or flexible we arrived before the room was ready but needed to change for a wedding 
138591,Henley House Hotel, This was advertised as a 4 star hotel it is most definitely a 3 star hotel The rooms were tiny and the bathroom very small as well The conservatory photo is deceiving that room is not available for guests except for breakfast we were really hoping to use this room in the afternoon , The bed was fantastic Very comfortable and clean fresh linen
138592,Henley House Hotel, Only con is the space is small other than that it s perfect , The staff was very friendly rooms really clean well decorated very nice tv
138593,Henley House Hotel, Could have done with a more powerful shower more of a trickle , Staff very helpful and nothing was too much trouble We stayed in room 11 which was very quiet just the job 
138594,Henley House Hotel, The room is smaller than it looks on the photo I have seen on the site , I liked that the room was very proper and it had a very comfortable bed Good breakfast with salty and sweet choices cold and warm The location is also good 
138595,Henley House Hotel, The bed was terrible very uncomfortable hard and small for 2 persons The room was very small perhaps it always is in London and a very small bathroom hit my head a lot The breakfast was very small but ok , It was located in a quiet area easy to sleep Close to the Underground and to restaurants and pubs Also there was a supermarket and a liquor store very close The staff was friendly and helpful 
138596,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic location just a 2 minute walk from the well connected Earl s Court Tube station The hotel itself is quiet and characterful with friendly staff and stylish rooms overlooking a pretty garden square Perfect for a short break 
138597,Henley House Hotel, There is one thing I can mention about the water pressure in a toilet My room was 3rd floor the shower water pressure was very weak so it was so irritating I think they need to do something for it , Everything was good for staying the hotel 
138598,Henley House Hotel, The safe in my room unfortunately did not work Henley House is a perfect stay for people who travel as tourists It s cosy But since I am a business traveler I probably will not stay here again missing amenities that are important to me to make my stay as comfortable as possible like the possibility to order room service the hotel having its own restaurant bar 24 hour reception etc A big minus in my opinion is that the rooms hallways weren t tidied up when I checked in at 14 30 15 00 o clock Cleaning staff was still busy and sheets and linens were literally everywhere in the hallway I had to take big jumps with a suitcase to pass the mess That does not give the right first impression , Staff is very friendly and helpful 
138599,Henley House Hotel, Breakfast It was just croissants and fruit or a bit of yogurt I think there was cereal too The dining room was so busy and cramped we didn t bother going for breakfast again and instead ate out , It was great value for money and loved the decor and the cosiness of the beds with the sparkly lights above Nice touch 
138600,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, Fresh croissants fresh good fruit excellent and friendly staff and really well furnished rooms I was in a single room and some may have called it pokey but it was done out very well the blinds at the shower wall mean you get extra light in the room Great little mini bar and work space and selection of TV channels Wifi flawless connection 
138601,Henley House Hotel, Did not like the breakfast waitress stepping in right in front of me to get her own coffee and breakfast , The Bed general layout of the room Good TV overall very comfortable
138602,Henley House Hotel, Single room very small but adequate for one night and reflects the reasonable price , Relatively quiet location just off Earls Court Road and just a couple of minutes from tube station Pleasant small hotel good continental breakfast served in bright and airy conservatory
138603,Henley House Hotel, We stayed for 2 nights in room 23 lovely views over the gardens unfortunately we had a very noisy person next to us on the first night who had the TV on very loud until the early hours and put it on again loud at 7 am The 2 nd night was nice and quite hotel said I should have phoned then and they would have contacted the person in the room will do this in future , Excellent location for museums and direct tube line to Lyceum theatre from Earls court Hotel is in a quite side street no street noise at night which is a real bonus in London
138604,Henley House Hotel, The breakfast was one of the poorest i v had in a hotel Nothing hot not even toast just cold ham cheese and rolls happy shopper yoghurts that said 42p on them The only hot food you could have was boiled eggs but you would have to cook them yourself , A small room but very well presented extra care taken with the fixtures and fittings 
138605,Henley House Hotel, The rooms are smaller than you think and we found the bed quite uncomfortable There were tea bags in the breakfast room but no hot water and the staff there did not seem to want to enter into any sort of conversation all a bit awkward really There were also noisy guests playing loud music late at night and since there was no one at reception to deal with it we had to bang on the wall , The location is decent very near to Earls Court Tube Station The guys on reception were friendly 
138606,Henley House Hotel, We found that hot water was sometimes luke warm The room though adequate was very small , The staff were excellent The was room clean and tidy breakfast was good 
138607,Henley House Hotel, Very small room and ditto bathroom rain shower was max 195 high I m 203 cm tall sooo clean but old bedsheets four stars in combination with 8 5 score made expectations high er , Staff was most friendly
138608,Henley House Hotel, Mini elevator which is occupied durring the day with clean towels and bedding and you should GO one floor extra so YOU will only have to GO 2 stairs down otherwise YOU will walk 15 stairs up with all of you re luggage Keep in mind breakfast is only untill 9 00am , Good location nice rooms available electrical adaptors on reception Realy kind staff 
138609,Henley House Hotel, It was not a case of not liking just wanted to add comment that gardens just across the hotel are apparently available to guests It was a shame that reception did not have the most up to date key to the entry gate , Staff helpful Clean room and ensuite Very good continental breakfast
138610,Henley House Hotel, Nothing, The hotel was well positioned and did not try to be anything other than an ideal base for a short visit to London It provides an excellent service in respect of this and has a large variety of good value restaurants in the immediate vacinity 
138611,Henley House Hotel, Too tiny room some problem with water supply in the bathroom the water flow in the shower was insufficient practically nothing , Good location well equipped facility nice staff
138612,Henley House Hotel, No English breakfast First room we got was stinking of cigarettes but we got new fresh , Rooms are nice recently refurbished Staff was very friendly and responsive Pubs in around

138614,Henley House Hotel, NOTHING , EVERYTHING The single rooms are small but that doesn t matter as they are packed with everything you need to hand Everything was clean and very well organised with refrigerator safe huge TV and great air conditioning The lighting is very adaptable and bedside dressing table etc all catered for The single bed was larger than usual the service was excellent I asked for more tea and milk as I drink a lot of tea and it was delivered to the room in 6 minutes Breakfast was fresh croissant and rolls and fruit juices cold meat cheese fruit and boil your own eggs plus fresh coffee and tea Lovely staff friendly and professional DO NOT TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THE ODD BAD REVIEW THEY MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE AS IT IS SUPER VALUE FOR 99 
138615,Henley House Hotel, Room was rather small as was bathroom Wardrobe should hang clothes left to right rather than front to back No socket anywhere near a mirror , Location of hotel and cleanliness of room
138616,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, What a find and what a gem of a modern boutique hotel A peaceful retreat in a lovely situation yet only 5 minutes away from a tube station and excellent transport links A long established hotel but refurbished during the last few years our double room was so well appointed modern light and airy with excellent facilities such as the ultra modern bathroom and easy to adjust heating system The beds were extremely comfortable two marvellous nights sleep Breakfast was included in the excellent room rate making this exceptional value for money The continental breakfast was plentiful with extremely helpful efficient staff seated in the conservatory which was light bright and inviting Everywhere was spotlessly clean throughout the hotel The reception area was welcoming and secure being able to leave luggage for collection was a real plus Once again all the reception staff were so very helpful We liked the idea of the loyalty scheme since it suggests a genuine interest in retaining your custom This was our first time at the Henley House Hotel but it definitely won t be our last already signed up to the loyalty scheme Many thanks for a superb stay 
138617,Henley House Hotel, The bathroom was quite small hair dryer wasn t comfortable , I liked the reception staff very polite and helpfull The location and the wiev were really good 
138618,Henley House Hotel, Soundproofing not good I could hear everything from rooms next door even the light switches And snoring Take some earplugs or headphones , Friendly staff good breakfast easy to find location Comfortable and modern room 
138619,Henley House Hotel, I didn t like the bright lighting I wish it was possible to have the star lights above the bed on alone There were minor traces of dirt e g The tap was sticky and there were dirt drops on the toilet walls The pillow and the carpet both had a dirt stain too Would have been helpful if there was a table for eating leisure, I liked the very helpful smiley friendly staff nice chilled atmosphere and the Smart TV Nice exterior and rooms are decorated very nicely Would definitely stay here again as it was very good value for money as my stay also included a nice selection of breakfast 
138620,Henley House Hotel, Smaller rooms but neat and modern , Great location in a quiet neighborhood with plenty of restaurants and easy access to the Earl s Court tube station 
138621,Henley House Hotel, Single room was very small Space to get into the shower would be a challenge for many plus sized travellers Luckily I only had a carry on suitcase , Location couldn t be better Staff super helpful and friendly Decor of room is stunning
138622,Henley House Hotel, Smallish bathroom but comfortable shower tiny lift and narrow stairs Breakfast time too short I would prefer till 10am , Huge room double room and bright everything clean perfect location close to Earl s court tube station with Piccadilly and District Line and some shops and pubs Black Bird is the best 
138623,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, The staff is very friendly and helpful location of hotel is very good 3mins walk from the hotel to the underground station Good wifi and good service My stay is during Christmas at Christmas Eve the staff has put a Christmas card and pudding on the desk that makes me feel really warm Thank you again 
138624,Henley House Hotel, In the 21st century I think it s essential that the hotel provides a steam generator for ironing I also would have preferred the choice of an English breakfast , The staff were friendly and helpful The decor was modern and the location is good 
138625,Henley House Hotel, terrible sound which lasted like 4 hours from 11 3am sounded like a piping water issue No1 on reception to alert as was quite late Meant i couldn t sleep , Nice boutique place
138626,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, Great location in a quiet square near to Earl s court tube station Well appointed rooms good continental style breakfast By comparison to other small hotels nearby this place is excellent 
138627,Henley House Hotel, The shower entrance in the single room is exceptionally small and if you were very overweight you would not be able to have a shower Single room very small but well appointed no face washers in room and only enough tea and milk for one cup Fridge not turned on for arrival Not sure that they should bother with breakfast as when they are full there is just no room , Close to Station and shops Plenty of places to eat close buy and set in a pretty location 
138628,Henley House Hotel, My room was very warm Opening a window solved the problem but it was at the back of the hotel which meant being kept awake most of the night by the noise of Earls Court Station and a nearby air conditioning unit The walls were also very thin and when I wasn t kept awake by the external noise I was disturbed by the all night long snoring of the guest in the adjacent room This may not be a problem in a larger room at the front of the hotel , Exquisitely clean modern room facilities Free wi fi Friendly staff Exceptionally good breakfast included in room price Wide variety of good restaurants a five minute walk away 
138629,Henley House Hotel, The room was modern and clean with a TV over the bed but about as small as you could get and a bit claustrophobic so didn t spend much time there There was a squeaky noise outside all the time because of something on the neighbours roof which was annoying but fortunately had my ear plugs The lift was tiny and could fit 2 people close up or 1 person and a suitcase The breakfast people were not that friendly and a good morning would of been nice Wouldn t book a single room again, The reception staff were friendly and helpful and printed out my boarding pass for me The hotel design was modern and so not depressing The location was good close to Earls Court Road and the tube station and wallking distance to the museums kensington and Hyde Park 
138630,Henley House Hotel, The window at the front rattled and was not very good at reducing road noise Poor water pressure , Well decorated and modern room with comfortable bed Very close to Earl s Court 
138631,Henley House Hotel, Very compact spaces Would have liked slightly bigger shower and more diffused overall lighting in the bathroom rather than spotlights Otherwise all fine , Courteous staff very close to underground station great location close to several dining options Good breakfast and very clean room Welcome and friendly atmosphere 
138632,Henley House Hotel, I never usually bother to write reviews however I had such a bad experience I have decided to make an exception This hotel if it can be called that is responsible for without doubt the worst nights sleep that I have ever had having spent 12 years in the army i m not exactly a princess about where I sleep either The bed was terrible sleeping on the pavement outside would of been more comfortable I have never felt a bed so hard My back still hurts now an its two days later The shower was also terrible with only luke warm water Breakfast is served from 0730 which is no good when you have to be somewhere early When it is being served its horrendous hardly any selection Stale tasteless croissants served with bitter coffee Also the reception is not manned between 2300 0730hrs so if you do need anything you can t get it anyway I would never stay here again I have no idea how this place has had good reviews Poor poor standards , Hotel is close to the tube station this is its only good point
138633,Henley House Hotel, Breakfast is modest but alright Not much water coming out of the shower , Very modern rooms which one wouldn t expect from the outside Excellent location very close to Earls Court tube station 
138634,Henley House Hotel, They served the exact same thing for breakfast the entire six days I stayed there It s the only complimentary meal and they should incorporate variety in their breakfast Not good at all , The cleanliness and professionalism of the staff
138635,Henley House Hotel, the water tap in the bathroom could be a bit better , It was our second stay at Henley House Hotel and we ve got a great room Staff was friendly as always

138637,Henley House Hotel, We didn t like the fact that there appears to be no one on staff overnight in case of an emergency how would the 9999 responders gain access to the building The elevator was not working for our floor so either lug suitcases up half a flight or down half a flight Okay if you have carry on but not for the larger ones , Great location good bed in quiet room generous buffet breakfast friendly staff 
138638,Henley House Hotel, Room was very small as had been mentioned in many reviews , So convenient to tube station and for walking Guests were very friendly in the pleasant breakfast room Room and facilities upgraded well

138641,Henley House Hotel, The room was very small even by London standards If you were anything other than medium sized then the bathroom would have been too small for you , Staff were great and the decor of rooms was really nice WiFi worked Bed was comfortable This place best suited to business trips or person with little luggage 
138642,Henley House Hotel, Not a bad experience but the room window is faulty would not stay open to provide ventilation and had no safety bars on the outside potentially dangerous , The staff were first rate 
138643,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, Very helpful polite staff Room was compact but very nice very modern but with lots of nice touches to give it character and cosiness And given its location so close to Earls Court Rd with all its restaurants etc incredibly quiet peaceful 
138644,Henley House Hotel, Room we were allocated very small too small Management emphasised room was small but this was shoebox size , Location in Earls Court is good close to banks shops station Continental breakfast well done 
138645,Henley House Hotel, The hotel should have announced in the booking site that single rooms are in the fifth floor and that the lift goes only to the fourth floor You can t take more than one piece of bag as the room is too small, Excellent Very clean So close to earl s court station Staff are so nice Faces quiet and beautiful garden
138646,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, Clean modern and close to most things We stayed a week here on the top floor and found everything to be really great It is close to the underground and shops Breakfast was ok continental but you could boil a egg and the staff would cook some toast Nice view from the room of a park across the road Staff great Quite from outside noise but thin walls inside we could hear the TV and talking from the room next door
138647,Henley House Hotel, There was a mix up with the booking which was entirely my own fault and was fixed at the end but the staff was not very sympathetic or helpful beyond the minimum Also there was only one set of towels rather than two in a Double Deluxe Room I have reported this to the Reception Again there was not much response other than an unenthusiastic sorry , Three minutes from the underground station Modern beautiful and very clean room Had a lovely balcony as well 
138648,Henley House Hotel, Only 2 plug sockets Smart Tv isn t so smart Only had one towel in the room so had to ask for another Shower isn t powerful Breakfast room only seats 26 but there are 46 rooms , Very modern clean noise free free wifi had a complementary birthday cake for the Girlfriend 
138649,Henley House Hotel, I didn t like the fact that the top of the tap came off in my hand each time I used the sink and the walls were quite thin , I liked the location the staff were friendly and we had a good nights sleep overall 
138650,Henley House Hotel, The room we have is so tiny that it s is actually not suitable for 2 It is good enough for one The bed is so tiny that I almost fell off the bed at some instances ,No Positive

138653,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, London hotels are fairly pricey when you are looking for a decent standard with decent decor I spent several hours trawling through and dismissing hotels until I stumbled across this little gem Perfect location to the tube lovely modern clean rooms and even breakfast included in the price Not all that common for London hotels To top it off it is very reasonably priced Keep up the good work and if the price stays reasonable we will definitely use this hotel again 
138654,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, Near to underground station we love our room with a balcony facing the garden The room is perfect and we had a great stay At the last day we need to do early check out and they let us have the breakfast even though the breakfast is not ready yet

138656,Henley House Hotel, There were some strange people hanging around two blocks away from the hotel and I didn t feel good walking around unfortunately , Service was nice at front desk and nice to have fruites and complimentary service ware and Juice 
138657,Henley House Hotel, Breakfast underwhelming tough croissants and boring rolls lots of pre packaged stuff even the milk Small changes here would really improve the experience , Good sized room with everything we could need 
138658,Henley House Hotel, No bad experience here but a very positive one The rooms are on the smaller side but in keeping with many of the European properties in this range , Very clean efficient property with positive and helpful staff The location was excellent making the whole package one that we would gladly come back to and recommend to others The rooms were very up to date in terms of hi tech fixtures etc 
138659,Henley House Hotel, We booked a room with a king bed but the bed we got was no bigger than a twin , We were given a friendly welcome The room was sparkling clean with lots of modern features and for once the photos give a true reflection of the actual room It is on a nice quiet street great for getting a good nights sleep
138660,Henley House Hotel, In room safe was broke and had to call night shift staff Hard to get hold off staff at night but once we did he was very helpful and resolved the issue , Location and staff close to metro supermarket nearby 
138661,Henley House Hotel, Elevator is ridiculous so one needs to take stairs There was a glass in my bathroom that was not clean though the rest of the place was perfect , Room was microscopic but amazingly comfortable and cozy They did a miracle with the space they had to work with Location is perfect 2 min walk from Earl Court 
138662,Henley House Hotel, Room is very small less than 10m , Very convenient location and comparatively quiet Nicely decorated room good breakfast great value for money at GBP 110 
138663,Henley House Hotel, The room was very small a single so I think this is fairly standard , The staff were very friendly and helpful While the room I had was small it was well appointed felt lovely The cobtinental breakfast was well done with the hot croissants a definite highlight
138664,Henley House Hotel, The room was fairly clean but carpet was dirty stained the bathroom facilities were worn dirty The cup spoon supplied in the room had food stuck to them I had to go to reception to get clean ones The lady at breakfast knew very little English just answered yes to everything I asked , Great location that s about it 
138665,Henley House Hotel, Some stuffs in a room are old fashioned maybe better to change a new one like hangers also prepare more various coffee tea bags Rather small bathroom, The location friendly staffs room condition cleanness included breakfast
138666,Henley House Hotel, cleaning can be improved there were lots of hairs in the bathroom this should absolutely NOT happen in this price class the towel holder was not properly attached to the wall, small but nice hotel rooms are quite small as it is typical for London but equipped quite nicely the breakfast buffet is quite small However there is nice service team and you can get additional food which cannot be found at the buffet just ask 
138667,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, The location is in a safe area close to the tube with shops and great pubs with fantastic meals and the staff at the hotel were very helpful and friendly 
138668,Henley House Hotel,No Negative, The very cheery and helpful receptionist made our short stay very enjoyable She went out of her way to advise us regarding timetables and routes and we came away with a smile The hotel is small but cosy The rooms are again small but very well laid out and very comfortable and clean Overlooking the garden at the rear of the property was an added bonus Breakfast was buffet with choices and very adequate We would definitely use again and hopefully see the lovely staff again 
138669,Henley House Hotel, Lovely room however being located behind reception and off of the corridor to the breakfast room it was noisey and not very private , Very well designed and equipped room
138670,Henley House Hotel, Maybe breakfast could be better My single room was small but it was nicely decorated and very well equipped , Staff was very friendly they even checked me in early with no problems Location of hotel is excellent not only for being close to Earl s Court station but also there were many good restaurants and supermarkets nearby Area is quiet and safe no problems walking at night

138673,Henley House Hotel, Evening receptionist kept us waiting 10 minutes when we arrived at 22 30 feeling very tired after travelling , Location quality of room fittings breakfast morning receptionist
138674,Henley House Hotel, Although it was our fault for not checking we missed breakfast because we arrived at 9 20 and it appeared to finish at 9 15 Too early we thought , In all respects very good indeed Except a thing about breakfast 
138675,Henley House Hotel, Limited channels on the TV , Lovely quiet single room at the top of the house Very compact but clean and comfortable en suite Nice TV Breakfast room has improved since the refurbishment 
138676,Henley House Hotel, Very difficult to find suitable parking nearby and although we were aware that the breakfast was only continental it was still somewhat disappointing , A small hotel in a great location being very close to the tube station pubs and restaurants yet still very quiet Spotlessly clean good sized room with a stylish bathroom 
138677,Henley House Hotel, Incredibly small room problem with the air conditioning It was uncomfortably hot which the staff did rectify for a small time but with no one on reception at night time it was an unpleasant stay unfortunately Breakfast was also very poor Small, Good location clean room
138678,Henley House Hotel, There is no cooked breakfast as such They do have an egg cooker where you can hardboil yourself an egg or two Not being a big breakfast eater it was ok for me , The proximity to Earls Court station was great for us as travelling with bags is not easy It is a charming building facing a private square so the outlook if you are lucky enough to get a balcony room as we were is lovely The room had been recently refurbished and had a comfortable bed with tea coffee making facilities and a good wi fi connection The staff were very very helpful and pleasant 
138679,Henley House Hotel, The breakfast is pretty limited however they do have delicious hot fresh croissants and good coffee And it was complimentary so cannot really complain , We stay in London every now and then and this was our first time at Henley House We cannot even compare this to other hotels in London for the some price where we have stayed previously We got a big room with an amazing view The room was newly refurbished with luxurious bathroom The service was perfect such great staff giving more individual service than in big chain hotels The location is also perfect beautiful part of the city close to many restaurants coffee shops and pubs as well as tube station We will definitely go back 
138680,Henley House Hotel, Room felt too compact for two I don t like having to manoeuvre round the bed to get to the bathroom The breakfast was OK but why use tinned fruit when at this time of the year there are o many fresh fruits to offer like watermelon pineapple kiwi and nectarines etc , Convenient clean and friendly The reception staff member was very helpful and friendly It was quiet too

138685,Henley House Hotel, Poor shower water pressure No plug socket near any of the mirrors so couldn t blow dry hair in front of a mirror This sounds minor but is really annoying and bad planning , Modern and clean
