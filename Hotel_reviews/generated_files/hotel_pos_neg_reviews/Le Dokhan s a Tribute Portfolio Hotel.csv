37377,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Upon arrival yheir sytem could not accept my master card which was the same as I made the booking with The same afternoon I retrieved money from the ATM with the same card I produced another card a platinum Master card which was also rejected by their system Then I gave them my Amex gold card which they accept The same happened the next day I still could not pay with my master cards It also happened to an American couple who checked out the same time as I did What if I had not shown up they would have certainly charged my master card I feel I m being manipulated and I will never stay in this hotel again , The bed was good
37378,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, The toilet was stuffed in what seems to be an old broom closet I have friends that wouldn t be able to fit in there alone without a toilet to get their legs around , This hotel was fantastic We spent our honeymoon there and had the time of our lives It s 1 block from the metro and you can walk in 5 minutes to a nice selection of restaurants It s also been the eiffel towerr and the arc de triumph 
37379,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, The toilet faces the window you can t sit normally because your legs touch the window And they did not have blinds so if the bit of net moves everyone sees you on the loo or at night when lights on everyone can see you could do with some blinds instead for privacy , Very comfortable and beautiful hotel
37380,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Breakfast could be much richer in variety in three days it gets rather boring Lacking multimedia features suggestions a Hi Fi stereo and more reliable WiFi False fire alarm in the morning, Fantastic view Great location Very comfortable suite Eiffel Loved the design Nice bar and lobby Friendly helpful staff
37381,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Nothing, This is a fabulous hotel and I d really like to keep it secret The room was cosy and comfortable and very well furnished As for the double bed it was without doubt the best bed we ve ever experienced at any hotel we ve stayed in 
37382,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Everything was very expensive and the wifi connection was very spotty Also the way that the rooms are set up with the bed next to the door is very concerning If I was staying there alone I wouldn t have wanted to sleep right next to the door The final thing was that there was no currency exchange on site we had to walk quite a bit to go to a currency exchange location that was close to a mile away Not very convenient , Our accommodations were really clean the food was good and the staff was very nice friendly Our favorite thing was the phone that came with the room Extremely helpful when we were out and about and also helped us stay in contact with our families as the wifi made using WhatsApp nearly impossible 
37383,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, nothing, it was super i loved the idea of the mobile phone that free of charge the room was so comfy too the location was super perfect i strongly recommend staying at this hotel
37384,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, temperature it was way too hot in the hotel and room even when heating turned low Also the bathroomdoor was damaged and elevator broke down , service was good room was tidy
37385,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, The only thing that did not work while we were there was the elevator but they kindly offered us a bedroom on the 2nd floor awesome , Ambiance location comfort everything was just perfect Next time we go to Paris that s our place to stay 
37386,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Corny style rooms are very small it is hardly possible to fit in the toilette 90 level of equipment The really worst was breakfast which is supposed to be served between 6 30 and 10 At 7 30 around 8 business travelers were waiting for breakfast at empty tables no buffet system we had nothing to drink I gave it up after 25 minutes of waiting there was no staff no water tea or coffee nothing This is unacceptable even from a 3 star hotel The hotel breakfast is 30 euros and all you get in frustration Truly the worst price value ration I have ever experienced , Very good location walking distance from Trocadero and Arch of Triumph 
37387,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, The elevator was not working In two days I was stopped inside three times However in a such magic atmosphere even the lift broken pass in background , One of the most beautiful hotel ever Unique magic atmosphere like staying at house The room to taste champagne is something fabulous 
37388,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, I choose the package with the continental breakfast However the continental breakfast only included a bakery basket and some fruit Any yogurt or cereals had to be added The selection of products offered with this type of breakfast is poor for a hotel of this standing The bathroom although clean could do with some remodelling The carpet in the room also No restaurant in the hotel , The hotel location is nice and easily attainable from the Metro station The old building adds charm to the ambiance of the hotel The staff is helpful and welcoming The restaurant s does not exist in the hotel but it is possible to order room service quality is acceptable 
37389,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, There was not anything we didn t like , Old style Parisian atmosphere Very well appointed room with extremely comfortable bed Friendly helpful staff Good continental breakfast with good coffee Last stayed at hotel 9 years ago it has been very well maintained and is as good as we remember it It is quite expensive but you get what you pay for 
37390,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel,No Negative, The suite is large and very comfortable We were greeted with smiles and jokes at reception The view from our room was amazing We loved staying here 
37391,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, The bed was massive just a little on the soft side , This was our honeymoon The staff were friendly and spoke good English They were very helpful and offerred to arrange trips etc We had already pre booked our trips and activities The hotel is in a great spot and close to lots of bars and restaurants 
37392,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, food a bit limited and generally v expensive TV and channels v limited and operated poorly certain access in room such as to and in bathroom v cramped, cosy stylish charm nice room decor excellent position in Paris staff helpful
37393,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Price bears no relation to quality room small no place to store clothing bad air conditioning elevator doors close on you lack of amenities , Location
37394,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Small depressing lobby very small room that is the deluxe very old furniture no air conditioning very expensive rate for one night 400Euro Very deceiving to rate this hotel as 5 star hotel, Nothing
37395,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Nothing wrong with this hotel at all , A well located Boutique Hotel which is close to many attractions and Metro for others Our suite had the perfect view of The Eiffel Tower which was absolutely amazing to watch at night especially with its hourly dazzling light display 
37396,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, We couldn t figure out the air conditioning system in the room so the room was a bit too warm at night We opened a window and were fine Future guests might find it useful to have instructions in the room , This hotel is in a great location The surrounding area was safe and quiet The Eiffel Tower is 15 minutes walk away and there s a metro station nearby A perfect base from which to explore Paris We received a warm welcome from the beginning and were very pleased with our spacious suite room 601 Our flight home was cancelled so we stayed an extra night and the reception staff couldn t have been more accommodating The champagne bar is lovely and it doubles as the breakfast room Breakfast was a delicious combination of a baker s basket with lovely fresh pastries and bread fruit and eggs cooked to our preference Plenty of coffee too The wee lift is awesome and just one feature of a beautiful hotel 
37397,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Before you book make sure to check if VAT is included You don t want to be surprised by the extra charges I suggest you have your breakfast out , Beautiful boutique Hotel Very Clean and quiet GREAT Location Would stay there again for sure Bed was absolutely Comfortable Staff very friendly and helpful

37402,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, No corkscrew in the room even though there was a bottle of corked wine there Only a bottle opener was provided and staff could not locate any corkscrews Was not a big deal but as a luxury hotel it s an expectation , Staff were exceptional always smiling always a cheerful greeting and very accommodating The bed and pillows were exceptional Quiet location 
37403,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, this hotel really looks nice in a pictures but in the real very bad room very very small bad smell in the room from the bathroom the wall has broken areas the bath very small charge for TV is very high and no free TV I have photos to the room how was the door and the wall damage but I couldn t download long time waiting the lift when it s come only for 2 persons I booked 2 rooms 240 for 1 room per night then I want to cancel the booking they don t accept to return my money bcz I paid cash and the said they don t have cash then I can cancel only 1 night from my booking which was 3 nights Really really the municipality of Paris should check it again to rate it as 3 stars not 5 stars I met the another guest in lift he was the same feeling about this hotel facilities It s only have radisson blue name no any other thing radisson finally I suggest all the traveler to don t take this hotel and I m always on travel and this is the first time I feel I got the wrong booking hotel always I m happy with other hotels , Nothing
37404,Le Dokhan s a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Claustrophobic rooms corridors reception desk restaurant basically everything I guess this is typical Paris so Dear Guest don t be fooled by a five star category of this hotel everything will be tiny as usual in Paris , The price for the room was rather good for a theoretically 5 star standard Nice bathroom good ammenities
