278047,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, 1 Room Magnetic Keycard This Hotel has a serious problem with their magnetic strip room key cards My cards were never near a mobile phone or TV But they went off a few times in the 2 night stay It was a nuisance and was more painful as these guys have really slow elevators 2 Slow Elevators Only 6 levels but has 3 public elevators But it takes forever to come Why THey are very slow And when you have issues with your magnetic key like we had a few times 20 mins are gone going back down and back up again , Great staff Excellent during Check in and check out Very helpful to call a cab etc Great customer service 
278048,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, A bit noisy from the surrounding niteclubs Seaview was just that a Seaview above buildings, Loved our room with the balcony Staff were great very attentative Did their utmost to make our stay wonderful
278049,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Everything was great , Great staff Concierge was amazing Restaurant had some of the best dishes i have ever tried We had a late flight so even though we checked out hotel allowed us to use the pool and even organised a room for us to have a shower in and get ready before leaving for the airport Highly recommended 
278050,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Tea coffee in our room was replenished adequately Neither were the flannels in the bathroom Lift out of order made for a bit of stress , The breakfast was excellent and staff friendly and helpful
278051,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Three lifts means you have to wait a while Not the end of the world though, Nice rooftop pool and excellent location for beach and clubs Good value for money Staff very friendly too
278052,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Room incredibly noisy Seemed windows not sound proofed at all Air conditioning not sufficient and the room was much too hot Room cleanliness was not up to standard bathrobe stained Shower leaked, Nice location at the beach Easy to walk to most areas Staff excellent very helpful Public areas good Rooftop pool area nice
278053,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Being asked to pay for use of the steam and sauna rooms Gym facility was poor for the quality of the hotel and so was the positioning of the gym , It was great hotel and well located 
278054,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, We booked the Pullman Skipper for our honeymoon stay in Barcelona As it was advertised as a 5 star hotel we wanted to pamper ourselves To summarize our opinion of the hotel following our stay it appears that the hotel caters almost exclusively to the business traveller and in doing so alienates the couples and or families that may be staying there The cons are Noise We requested to have a sea view but this was a detriment to us The sliders for the balcony are paper thin and you can hear everything This includes club style music that they blast from both pools starting at 9am and not ending until 1am There is also a popular outdoor nightclub across the street where the noise is heard in all rooms until 6am Private functions As I mentioned before they focus on business groups primarily EVERY night that we were there they closed off the pool areas by 5pm for private functions We were unable to access any of these areas and again the noise was unbearable when these events were going on Lack of communication At times it was nice as they would provide a note on our beds as to what the weather would be the next day But one day we intended to go to La Sagrada Familia and walked for 20mins looking for a taxi but there were no taxis We had to take the metro We asked the front desk about this when we returned and it turns out there was a taxi strike that day The hotel knew about it but never informed the guests ahead of time We thought this was a major oversight , The pros of the hotel are location it is 5min walk from the beach and 15min walk from Gothic center It is also a 5min walk to the metro station in room amenities such as bathrobes Jacuzzi and shower turn down service large beds etc Hotel amenities There is a large gym two pools a bar and restaurant Staff The staff was super friendly from the maids to the check in counter 
278055,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Iron didn t work asked for a replacement but didn t get one Asked where the guadi church was gave me a map but failed to tell me they only they only accept online bookings on Fridays Asked for extra tea milk but didn t get any Was relaxing at the rooftop pool but a family came up allowed the children to run around screaming at each other and jumping on the specialist chair which allows disabled people to get in out of the pool also had some lads playing gangster rap music on their phones wouldn t normally mind but it wasn t the right time place , Room was clean spacious hotel staff were friendly and very nice rooftop pool
278056,Pullman Barcelona Skipper,No Negative, Great location close to the beach and quick to get into the main city 30 min walk or 5 mins in a taxi Close to good nightlife and clubs fronting the beach Rooftop pool and bar was excellent really enjoyed the live DJ sets in the afternoons Staff were fabulous and friendly 
278057,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Nothing we didn t like , This was an excellent property all around The rooms were very nice The beds were super comfy The staff was very friendly and very helpful 
278058,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Worst 5 hotel in the last 10 years I m only 5 star hotel traveller so it came to me as a shocking experience Management in the Accor Group need to take immediate steps to solve this mess Need to ask for everything almost Waste of time and energy instead of being able to enjoy your holiday f e Why no slippers in the room Why I can t get into my room Why wifi is not working Can we have more shower gel And so on and on Staff attitude is not acceptable Lack of efficient English speaking staff Constant wifi connection problems look photo Constant electronic key door problems The bathtub and shower in our room seemed to be shredded by previous guests same goes for half cracked ceramic sink look photos Cleanliness Noise in the room misadvertised as soundproof Disorganised chaotic service especially through breakfast you wait for a waiter to get coffee tea endlessly and than they take your plates when you are not finished It was more like circus than five star hotel , Never again Pull me out of there
278059,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, 1 A good bed the first visit A poor comfort bed on the second visit Noisy room 410 due to poor seal on the sliding door local noise easily entered the room until 01h00 2 Room not ready for occupation at 14h00 Had to be given an alternate room which was less comfortable condition of the bed and noisy , Polite staff Good quality breakfast General cleanliness 
278060,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, This is supposed to be a five star property This is along the lines of a days inn in the United States I would not rate this a five star hotel Ever The property has potential but it is not maintained properly They shouldn t advertise that they are on the beach because they are not ,No Positive
278061,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Drinks food at hotelbar on the roof is very expensive Luxery room for 3 is not good 3rd person has to sleep in a very small fold up bed more kids size , good breakfast buffet lot of choice seaview room
278062,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, However the TV stations were not in English except for the news channels If I had brought my family the children would have been lost However a few facilities need to be worked on well There should also be a card that tells us how to use some of the bathroom amenities as it took a while to decipher them , Staff were very helpful and courteous Willing to go the extra mile All that were approached were helpful and provided great suggestions Breakfast options were superb Room was comfortable especially the night blind It was great that it plunged the room into darkness so I had a great sleep despite the short nights 
278063,Pullman Barcelona Skipper,No Negative, The hotel staff and the hotel Alejandro made our staying amazing It was my birthday and Alejandro contacted my girlfriend before hand to make sure i have a amazing birthday They were very welcoming and helped us with every query The rooms were nice and it was all at reasonable price The bathroom has a jet bath which was amazing The roof top has a pool and bar which is enjoyable 
278064,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Pool bars weren t open and inside bar lacks atmosphere No decent plug points near mirrors in room Right room then not disturbed by traffic etc , Great location to mix beach city break Good local bars and clubs Nice brekkie selection 
278065,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Gym is small for an hotel of this size , Nice comfortable hotel with 2 nice pools and a great selection for breakfast Nice staff and great touch with some free pastries and coffee for supper at weekend nights when you come back from la movida 
278066,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Roof swimming pool closing early and opens 9 00 would be nice to be open all time , Lovely and very helpful staff roof swimming pool with bar fantastic 
278067,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Nothing I didn t like, The views and the best bed I ve ever slept in whilst being away loved the staff and they even went the extra mile by providing Champagne and beautiful cake as a special for my partners birthday in our room El Born is a great area for Tapas and the beach was lovely
278068,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Room service was not worth the money We ordered a pizza and got 4 rectangular slices That was the only downside about the hotel Everything was amazing , The hotel is literally 2 mins away from Barceloneta beach The location is really really convenient Also 2 mins away from Ciutadella Metro so getting about was really easy All staffs were really helpful and friendly We came to Barcelona to celebrate my partner s 21st birthday and the hotel experience was amazing On the second day we walked into our room with a short birthday message complimentary bottle of champagne and a cake for my partner I can certainly say that our trip to Barcelona was better than expected because of our stay at Pullman Highly recommended 
278069,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, I m afraid to say I was left extremely disappointed with my recent stay at Pullman Skipper I booked this hotel based on the location and great reviews I had read on trip adviser however the reality was some what different When we arrived to the hotel we was informed that we had been allocated the second best room in the hotel due to purchasing en executive suite for 3 adults we was taken to a room on the first floor in the far corner and shown to shoddy dark looking room facing the main road I requested a room with a nice view as the trip was for a special occasion the room did not look anything like the pictures dark red d cor with brown carpets damp patch on the ceiling and plug socket hanging off the wall see attached pics I spoke with the manager and was advised the hotel was full so it wouldn t be possible to move today I called a second time later that evening and was then informed a room had become available and would I like to see it we was taken to a room on the 4th floor which was completely different like the pictures much more spacious with light grey and white decor so we obviously agreed to move Another issue we had was our cards stopped working on numerous occasions meaning one evening we couldn t get into our room this also happened on a second occasion meaning we couldn t access the rooftop pool Most disappointing was the fact when we arrived we attempted to order some wine by the rooftop pool however was informed by staff that there was no menus due to only opening the day before If you are a 5 star hotel and you know what day you are opening surely you would ensure that a menu could be printed ahead of time especially when your menu is only a laminated piece of paper The menu was very limited and food of poor standard we ordered a pizza and this consisted of 3 measly slices , The bed was extremely comfortable the bathroom nice and spacious I liked the complimentary bottle of water and chocolates we received each evening nice touch Nice Outdoor Pool
278070,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, We were charged at 150 euros at the hotel and I still have not received this payment back The hotel is too business y and lacks character, Stunning bathroom
278071,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Nothing, We stayed two nights in Pullman Skipper The hotel has a great location which is just beside the Port Olympic Taking a early morning walk to enjoy the tranquility is such easy thing To play on the beach and enjoy the sunshine is not difficult either given the hotel s proximity To go the La Rambla and treat yourself to the great seafood in La Baqueria is very easy just taking bus 59 in front of the hotel 15 minutes you will be there in the busiest street of Barcelona The room is spacious and with heater in the bathroom So anything being washed it could be dried within 2 hours with the heater A special door is kindly incorporated into the inner decoration which ensures sound proof of the bedroom which is very considerate There s swimming pool on the ground floor and rooftop bar lounge restaurant on the ground floor In order to get to the Barcelona Sants railway station take the bus No 20 in front of the hotel and it s super convenient 
278072,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, nothing, Nice hotel friendly staff quick and easy check in Nice room with a balcony overlooking the pool and terrace area Nice bathroom with a bath and a walk in shower 2 or 3 mins walk from the beach and marina area 
278073,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Not a 5 star hotel Staff not trained enough Some of them clearly not enjoying their job Elevators super slow , Comfortable rooms Some with balconies overlooking the beach 
278074,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, The hotel is near a hospital so there were sirens in the morning and at night but it did not bother us too much The room service menu could do with some improvements on the food selection especially the night menu The pool on the ground floor looked uninviting and could use some deep clean as the floor looked stained and dirty The lobby looked a bit bland , The staff were very accommodating and friendly left us to enjoy the place and gave us some space The rooftop pool was beautiful and very relaxing The food in the restaurant was impeccable and the room given to us for the two days was spotless and we enjoyed the comfortable bed and the large tv was a great addition to the room There were available travel adapters from the main reception so if you are stuck for one it wouldn t be a problem The hotel is a walking distance to the casino restaurants the beach and other entertainment areas 
278075,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, F rs kte f ha rummet 1 timme extra dagen vi skulle checka ut men dom sa att hotellet var fullbokat men det var bara halvfullt V ldigt d lig urs kt Det ger definitivt inte plus po ng ,No Positive
278076,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Perhaps access to daily bike rentals either with the hotel directly or a nearby business The hotel is ideally located to explore Barcelona by bike however the nearby bike shop closed early at 1530 I would ve preferred more flexibility in this regard Returning the bike at the hotel would ve been a bonus too , I liked the amenities available in the bathroom and the overall comfort of the room 
278077,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, We came to have breakfast last minute which was completely out fault however arranged with the reception that it was still ok But then were interrogated by every personnel in the restaurant if we were still allowed to take food , The staff was excellent very friendly Overall the hotel was very good but left a feeling that was either still under constructions or renovation Was missing a final touch for a truly five star hotel
278078,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, The sea view room indeed had the sea but not as nice as depicted on the website , Super friendly and helpful staff Good breakfast Solid wireless Good sleeping comfort
278079,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, dinner was very disappointing as was the wine both were expensive compared to excellent restaurants locally , room spacious and comfortable staff extremely helpful and did as much as they could to make our stay enjoyable beds very comfortable and we upgraded to a quieter room with balcony
278080,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Rooms need some slight cosmetic refurbishment , Professional and helpful staff great in house services amazing food and drinks quality resort feeling within Barcelona 
278081,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, There s a busy noisy road nearby Could hear it even with the window closed We went offseason in the summer high season with people at the pool and bar I can imagine would be really noisy , Immaculate hotel close to the beach But also 5 mins walk to the Metro and all the popular tourist attractions are within easy reach Nice bathroom with double basin bath and modern shower Lovely breakfast big buffet selection Complimentary bottle of bubbly in my room because it was my birthday 
278082,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, N A, The staff was amazing They were very kind and professional It was easy to communicate with them They were very accommodating I appreciate their superb professionalism The room we stayed in was very nice and very comfy We will definitely return when we visit Barcelona again 
278083,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, The bed was horrible We couldn t sleep through even one night , The staff was very helpful kind and professional Lovely bathroom and generally a very clean room 
278084,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, It s a bit annoying that spa sauna hamam etc requires extra charge , Everything was excellent room staff food cleanliness the new year s eve dinner and party was fantastic 
278085,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, The hotel cannot help that it is in proximity to several nightclubs We were on a high floor yet could hear the club goers desperately trying to grab taxis circa 0200 until when we departed for the airport circa 0500 Although we feared that our taxi would be stolen by these clubbers or that our safety was at risk we did not have any issues We witnessed these clubbers going into the hotel to get pastries and then departing not guests at the hotel , The front desk staff was very welcoming and friendly The hotel is very nice and clean Breakfast had a variety from which to choose and was good We departed before breakfast began on our last day yet juice coffee and pastries were set up in the lobby for those of us missing breakfast 
278086,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Nothing really, I stayed in pullman total of 4 night it was above of my expectations the atmosphere of the hotel is quite and luxury typically met the standard of 5 stars hotels rooms are clean and bed is so comfortable and the balcony facing the sea which is something really amazing the receptionists team are dealing with customers in such professionalism way we really had great time enjoying the delicious breakfast buffet in morning I would definitely recommend Pullman for all my friends and eveyone looking for beautiful hotel near to the marina Special thanks for the hotel Management for the great and worm welcome we received upon our arrival and offering to have cup of coffee during check out timing best regards Haitham
278087,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Staff speak Spanish first That is tremendously arrogant especially in what is primarily a tourist business hotel Dark interior in room stayed in 319 The air freshener being used in the lobby The sofas in the lobby are just uncomfortable , Close to the beach 
278088,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Roof Pool closed on one of the days without any advance notice Could have done with a couple of biscuits in the room to have with the morning cup of tea I know very english , Felt very safe solo female traveller Quiet location near beach
278089,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, I was charged city tax after I booked through booking to include all taxs and my booking was 1670 which ended up paying 1730 pluse 63 euros for what they refer to city tax , The location and the size of the room
278090,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, The facility is old and not well maintained broken tabs blocked door to a bath room mattress with a pit in the center I always rolled to the center of a bed and if you look at ceiling at balcony you ll see dirt and mildew , Location is very good next to the sea beach and in walking distance from the Gothic center
278091,Pullman Barcelona Skipper,No Negative, The hotel is in a superb location for beach bars casino and culture We walk everywhere from the Pullman skipper only needing a taxi to park Guell or Sagrada Everywhere else we walk to The staff are friendly and helpful We ve stayed twice as a couple and also with friends and both times have been great We re coming back too This time with teenage children as the two pools and local beach bars are excellent too We need nothing more for a perfect city break 
278092,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, A little on the pricy side although that could be because of conference taking place , The general design of the hotel comfy spacious room with decent facilities staff was friendly helpful and clearly multilingual 
278093,Pullman Barcelona Skipper,No Negative, Very clean and comfortable room also very quiet The rooftop pool is great Staff is competent and helpful Location though not very central is very good 
278094,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, bathroom wasnt pristine Corners and edges not been cleaned properly Wifi needs more speed most hotels now a days give high speed broadband Good for casual users but not for business Very few options in the room bar , location great rooms are good too
278095,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Access to then downstairs pool area could be better You either have to walk through the bar or the restaurant , Really enjoyed the Spa facilities They were small but gave it a more personal feel The hotel is small but lovely in a great location for the beach or a walk into the city 
278096,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, The reservation payment being taken off in full from my credit card before I even checked in when the reservation on booking com allowed me to cancel to 18h00 the day of check in This is not acceptable to me as my travel plans can change at any time I want to and usually pay at checkout which is why I always use the option of being able to cancel the booking ,No Positive
278097,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, My room overlooked a busy road and traffic noise kept me awake most of the night during my stay Double glazing should have kept the noise out but it was hopelessly inadequate ,No Positive
278098,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Air conditioning could have been a bit more powerful and the menu could have been a little more variable and inventive , Two fabulous pools including one on the roof beautiful room although the ones with a balcony are better and more expensive 2 minute walk to a lovely beach albeit near a main road a longer walk to Barcelonetta with busy beach bars and so forth Long walk into Barcelona itself but public transport outside the door 
278099,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, The roof top pool was a bit tired and could do with a bit of care , Great staff good location and good breakfast Best nights sleep I ve had in a hotel It was our anniversary the staff went the extra mile to look after us 
278100,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, I thought the brown wood pannelling in the room a little old and worn out a wee bit dated the cooked part of the breakfast not great, The pool the bed the shower the bar The continental aspect of breakfast the staff were attentive efficient very friendly the restaurant food was delicious The Sangria the best I ve had It also a great location close to the beach restaurants and bars Also close to the metro but a couple of days I walked in to the Barri Gothic in no time Best of both worlds 
278101,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Our daugther hit her head on the door of the safetybox because of where it was placed in the room We reccomend you to move the box to somewhere where people cannot get hit The staff acted very professional in the situation and told us that they where willing to follow us to the local hospital so that was a great service ,No Positive
278102,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Our rooms faced the road Terrible view and soo noisy I was woken every night several times by traffic and rowdy night clubbers returning home at 5 6am The sound proofing totally insufficient and the air con also very poor but we couldn t leave a window open as felt like we were sleeping next to the M25, Staff on reception and restaurants were top notch
278103,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, the wifi in the hotel was terrible I could not get it at the pool and could get it for a moment at a time in the room by lying down pointing the phone to the ceiling but only in a certain direction ridiculous Also the hotel do not provide anywhere to shower later on in the day if you have a late flight The only place they have is the toilet area Usually 5star hotel would have a changing shower area in their gym spa but this was not the case albeit they have plenty of room to make somewhere , brilliant location if you want to be at the beach and within a stroll of lots of restaurants lovely staff and having gone for just the weekend the toiletries they provide means you dont have to travel with much breakfast fantastic 
278104,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Our check in was dreadful After emailing prior to arriving to ask if we could check in early we were told it would depend on availability which we understood But when arriving we were told 2pm which we also understood We came back to reception at 2 and still no room We waited till 3 30 before we got our room which was very frustrating when we could see other people checking in and able to get their room I notice on reviews that this has been a problem to other guests I think it s time to employ extra housekeeping staff when the hotel is busy We have also been charged on our credit card an extra amount We had checked out and finalized our account with cash This needs to still be resolved , Our dinner the night prior to early departure was yummy and the waiter was friendly 
278105,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, The check in was made by not well trained and competented srtaff As a result we were given keys of a room that was not ready and pre authorized the room charge and expenses twice The fact that a girl spoke our native language is definitely not enough to work with clients It is better to put more attention to the staff training in advance The water in the bathroom of our delux room either sticked or pored out I asked another trainer girl to send a staff to our room but nobody ever came It is a small thing of course but flowers in the vases in breakfast restaurant were in awful condition and were not pleasantly looking It is better to change the living flowers or to put the artificial ones The breakfast choice was good but did not give a feeling of first freshness unfortunately Especially green leafs and vegetables Because there are no elevators for staff use thouse we shared together were pretty crowded and slow to come , Location was quite good for us Room service was quick Amenities were rich in choice and good quality I appreciated the apologizing letter from hotel Client manager the present to the room and special breakfast offer hotel gave us as a compencation to the fact that one of our rooms was not cleaned by the time of our check in This problem was solved by this gesture Some staff was really nice and helpful 
278106,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, We were made to wait 45 mins after the 2pm check in time We arrived at 11 am paid for our weeks stay then left our luggage with reception until 2pm checkin At 2 45 after 2 visits to reception we were told we had already checked in and there were no rooms No one seemed to know where or when our room would be available It was a poor experience compared to the excellent service we received a year before There was an empty box of pringles in our mini bar on our arrival into the room which we could have been charged for had I not notified reception The shower heads were dirty on arrival There are not enough sun loungers at busy times and guest should not be allowed to leave towels on loungers for long periods of time during busy periods I know this is a common problem but it needs to be addressed by the hotel to prevent guests from fighting over loungers , The location is excellent we revisited the hotel for a 2nd year because it has balconies and because of its comfort The air con is much needed and the bed is very comfortable The hotel has 2 outdoor pools the rooftop pool has great views and the bar staff are very good The majority of the staff are very friendly and helpful 
278107,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Not much really The decor of the rooms is a bit heavy and dark ish but that s a minor concern The quality of beds totally outweighs it It is definitely a 5 hotel regarding the quality but maybe not for people who want luxury and glamour, Our aim was to have a relaxing seaside holiday and that s exactly what we got Hotel itself slightly more business orientated that I expected but an excellent accommodation nevertheless for everyone I guess people only tend to sleep in the hotel while in this beautiful city anyway Rooftop pool is beautiful the location of the hotel couldn t be better at the beach but also within walking distance to town if you like walking The taxi costs less than 10EUR to the centre Tip although the beach promenade is extremely enjoyable it ll be a hot in the summer and much longer walk to town than walking along the main road from the hotel entrance 
278108,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Didn t spoil our stay but some observations Light in the cupboards didn t work so sometimes it was hard to see clearly even with corridor light Few times room temperature could have been cooler as it was fixed at 19 degrees Shower head regulator was shared with a hand held so sometimes tricky to ensure properly turned off , Lovely touch we arrived to a bottle of cava on ice in our room to celebrate our birthdays Thank You Pullman Manager Customer service from housekeeping reception room service breakfast staff were excellent always friendly helpful and nothing was too much trouble Made a difference showed pride in city The BED was so comfy 2 singles put together with a soft topper We asked for water view although limited we did have one Breakfast till 10 30 weekdays 11am at weekends was a bonus 
278109,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Service at the Lower pool was too slow, Close to the beach top lounges and clubs Clean Friendly staff Mentioned we were on our honeymoon and were offered a nice treat
278110,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, We arrived early after leaving a cruise Whilst I didn t expect them to have a room ready in the morning it took till nearly 4 in the afternoon before we could get our room they did give us a couple of free drinks though Very close to nightclub area so in the morning there are lots of drunken revellers everywhere and lots of vomit on the streets Having said that inside the hotel you can t hear anything, The bed was amazing we had a suite and the and it was massive the breakfast was really good and the staff were friendly and helpful
278111,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Was astounded that guests were allowed to smoke in an area where others were dining Also that some guests smoked cigars in the lobby area This was extremely unpleasant , Spacious room and bathroom Location was the best 
278112,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Breakfast could be much much better For a 5 star hotel they need to improve this big time Because I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and this was by far the worst breakfast I have had at a 5 star hotel They need to have a live cooking counter with fresh made omlettes etc, Bed was good Facilities were good and the location was good too All you can ask for 
278113,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, The lifts were very slow and a couple would often stop working for a bit which caused traffic , Excellent location next to the restaurants water sports beach and nightlife 
278114,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, This is NOT a 5 star hotel It may have been when it first opened but those 5 star details are definitely lacking now There were poorly fitted fittings in the bathroom the bath was cracked the bed was really lumpy they had a hugely thick duvet in the bed there were cables hanging from the TV the bar on the roof smelled of sick the toilets around the pools were not the cleanest the breakfast buffet though good again is not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel Having said that the things I have mentioned would not put me off staying here again but only if I got a good deal and lowered my expectations , The location is great just seconds to get to the beach and at the quieter end a few minutes walk to the nearest metro and a 20 minute walk to some of the popular attractions The staff were all very friendly Actually fairly quiet considering its location 
278115,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, We waited 1 hour for our lunch as the staff couldn t find us Also the iron leaked all over my shirt we requested another and it did the same thing , The pool area was nice and room was comfortable
278116,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Rooftop pool could have been open a little later but it was nothing to be upset about , The bed was huge an extremely comfortable the location was absolutely amazing everything was within walking distance Overall fantastic place in a wonderful city 
278117,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Roof Terrace bar not as expected Food below average and overpriced and service fairly slow , The pink flamingos were amazing Really well thought out and positioned The free nibbles of assorted nuts and savoury type small biscuit snacks complimented my wife s Sauvignon blanc in the bellend bar 
278118,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Everything was really good Just I want to mention one little moment that is very easy to eliminate It could sound ridiculous but I am as a women had difficulties with mirrors As I said the bathroom is very good with a big mirror across the wall but it is very dark light in it The mirror in a wardrobe facing to the bright windows So you can see just a silhouette Possible in others room everything is fine It is a very minor inconvenience But a little table mirror could make life easier for lots of women , Have stayed there for 2 nights over the weekend The service is very good Staff is very helpful and polite The bed is comfy with lots of extra pillows The standard room is spacious with a good big shower and a bathroom You can find all essentials in your room very thoughtful The location is very good Two minutes to the beach Very easy to get a taxi outside the hotel to anywhere you want around 10 euros to the centre The hotel has two swimming pools They are all right with bars next by Last day we had a lunch It was good Not something special but fresh and nice with local products Thank you for comfort stay Definitely will stay at this hotel more times 
278119,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Overall I was very disappointed with my stay at the Pullman Skipper Barcelona I had high expectations considering the 5 star rating and the fact it was so expensive but it certainly did not live up to that billing The staff provided inaccurate information on our first morning regarding a city tour which resulted in us wasting over an hour of our time waiting for buses We stayed 2 nights and we never received fresh towels or had the room tended to in any way Some of the staff were friendly and helpful others were not We also had to wait 10 15 mins to check out while 2 staff remained outside the check in desk not assisting anyone Overall very disappointing stay considering the cost and not what one would expect from a 5 star hotel , Great location Room was lovely Facilities were good overall 
278120,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, They closed both pools on two separate days of our stay during normal operating hours for private parties A partial refund of our stay would be in order On a number of days our rooms wasn t serviced until late in the afternoon , The location is ideal for access to beaches nightlife and restaurants The all you can eat breakfast is quite delicious 
278121,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, It was far away from las ramblas and other cafe and restaurants , The hotel was very clean and the bed very comfortable also it was a very big bedroom and bathroom 
278122,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, The key didn t work and the staff tried to prove me it was my fault or rather that I didn t know how to use it Or that I kept my mobile near the key etc with first room they have assigned us not even their master key worked So we changed rooms It Didn t get any better Considering we both had copies of keys it really was hard to accept all the excuses During our three day stay it hasn t changed Reception promised to send a small gift to make up for all the troubles but it didn t happen Not very cool to make empty promises They charge 50 per pet per night which is the most we ever paid as not even 5 charge that much But I guess Spain s anti dog policy is to blame as very few hotels accept dogs Will not be back to Barcelona and to Pullman any time soon ,No Positive
278123,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Nothing, This is a really great hotel in the heart of the action next to the Puerto Olimpico The rooms are beautifully appointed and the beds extremely comfortable Two lovely pools one on the roof terrace which also has a great bar and views The breakfast buffet is extraordinarily good and a great patio area by the pool But for me the outstanding feature of the hotel is its staff very attentive polite and well organised a pleasure to deal with and any issues were addressed immediately and without fuss Will definitely stay there again 
278124,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, We had a terrible bar tender but I think he must of been in training The hotel room was also a bit tired need some touch up work , The breakfast was very good 
278125,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, The gym was very small and very little equipment, Amazing bed bathroom Very clean Loved the rooftop pool the amazing friendly helpfull staff Really good coffee quick service 
278126,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Excellent overall but when my room was cleaned they left me no bath towels , Great location for the beach and bars long walk 25 mins to the raval district bars Very comfy beds and clean rooms 
278127,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Even though we were attended to as soon as we arrived it took ages and ages to book in at reception , Breakfast had a good variety of fruit pastries hot breakfast items in very nice spacious surroundings 
278128,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Room wasn t ready until 4pm and only offered a standard drink after a day of travelling I had to ask them to look after my bag The staff were very rude missed items on room service and in restaurant on meals and drinks Access to rooftop pool didn t work via room card I had to call reception to come each time there were no clean towels provided on one day they provided no drink or meal service to the pool and they shut the rooftop pool for 2 days of my stay We went for drinks at the W hotel and the attention to detail from staff was excellent and no comparison to the Pullmans lack of service , The rooms were clean modern and the location was perfect for explore the city 
278129,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Design looks like back to 80th Old furniture and carpets Strange smell Scratches in the bath It needs to be fully renovated Poor breakfast like in 3 hotels 4 stars hotels of Barcelona left 10 times better impression, Location
278130,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, The breakfast was fairly terrible Undercooked scrambled egg fatty bacon the sausages were chewy the tomatoes looked good but were truly awful The mushrooms were decent though Overall I felt we paid over the odds for our stay , Handy location clean and comfy rooms nice pool on the top floor
278131,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, The window is terrible not enough sunshine in the room the noise from the street is very disturbing , The hotel is quiet good Very nice design of the rooms comfortable bed A lot of number of TV channels they even have 3 Russian channels which I enjoyed much 
278132,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Toiletries weren t replaced daily Water bottles weren t available daily Shower door leaked Bathroom was too dark Key lock to room didn t work Had to go next door to Hotel Arts to catch a taxi , Breakfast was good Staff were friendly Close to beach and Marina district with restaurants nearby 
278133,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Cold food Too many rules like can t eat breakfast outside Can t have own jug of coffee Pool towels only avail on roof , Cleanliness Bed Facilities
278134,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, A bit more light in the bathroom would be nice for putting on make up , we arrived earlier but we received our room immediately at noon already everything was very clean bed very comfy coffee and tea in the room was very nice Even the restaurant in the hotel was very good The rooftop pool and jacuzzi were heated Breakfast was wide variety Hotel is close to the beach and only a block away from the underground 
278135,Pullman Barcelona Skipper,No Negative, Everything was great Location is good and close to the metro Rooms are extremely comfortable and fully equipped Breakfast was also perfect with wide selection 
278136,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Internet connection was really poor if I was on a business trip I would not have been happy with it No english channels on the TV save CNN and BBC World News BBC1 should be minimum requirement Shower leaked quite badly into bathroom onto the tiles , The bed was very comfortable room spacious staff friendly Roof top pool was also very good it was also heated which was excellent o 
278137,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Very close to marina and Barcelonata but a bit far away from La Rambla and Gothic area Some servants were rude at the breakfast , Everything Especially the roof 
278138,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, The size of the toilet was too tiny for an adult In my room I can hear the bus and the traffic in the Main Street which was a bit annoying They need to soundproof the windows , Great breakfast Bed was fantastic Beside the beach and close proximity to the starting line of the Barcelona half marathon 
278139,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Moquette was little dirt and some dust over the furniture Housekeepers didn t change the pillow upon our request, Staff is helpful and always welcoming Room Has a wonderful bathroom
278140,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, the lady at the reception recommended a restaurant to us which cost us 5 people 340 euros The sea brass costs 150 euros which is too expensive compare to the others with the same standard restaurant The wifi is also not good in the rooms ,No Positive
278141,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, I booked triple room but gave us a double with no sofa bed Had to ask for extra toiletries and Because of the double instead of triple room, Location Friendly staff Comfortable bed Not noisy Lovely room view
278142,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, One Hotel bar staff I was buying drinks for several people 6 7 of us and we joined some tables together to sit together The waiter appeared to be bothered and told me that he will difficulty serving us as he would Have to squeeze in between us , New fresh looking Location is quite good Breakfast was good and the reception check in staff were excellent
278143,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, standard rooms on low level too noisy rooftop pool not heated jacuzzi not very inviting w o service upstairs and even temp too low bar at the pool upstairs not inviting no service heater etc no sauna or steam room without extra costs restaurant atmosphere cold un personal Hotel is well located but not in the league of comparable other 5 star hotels I visited in Barcelona, Nicely located at the beach front
278144,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, We booked a superior room with a sea view which was lovely but the noise of the people coming out of the sea front night clubs particularly on Friday Saturday night meant it was difficult to sleep even with the windows closed and to be honest we came home knackered instead of refreshed , Great location for the beaches and a very friendly welcoming and professional hotel 
278145,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, The door panelling for the shower didn t seem to fit very well Instructions for working the jacuzzi could also be made clearer , Very prompt and polite staff The room is also very clean and spacious 
278146,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Nothing to complain about, Everything They made our trip memorable by adding a heart made of roses in our bed and a bottle of wine Complimentery from the hoel
278147,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Everything was great , There was mix up with our reservation having booked a balcony room and not getting one The hotel staff were amazing they offered us a fabulous free meal and the following day transferred us to a suite by way of compensation Can t fault the staff Very friendly and super helpful Great experience great place 
278148,Pullman Barcelona Skipper,No Negative, Amazing buffet breakfast something for everyone great location just a 2 min walk to the beach and a 5 min walk to the nearest metro 15 mins and you are in the centre of Barcelona Very quiet with very little noise just the odd ambulance siren as it is close to a hospital All in all a very good hotel 
278149,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Difficult to find A little confusing to get the taxi , People were very nice and kind The room was clean and comfortable We also loved the interior and the ocean view of the room 
278150,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, I wouldn t rate this as a 5 star hotel great location even though it was early October and had 2 pools no pool bar or service to be had the iron was a danger , location was perfect for the beach and nice restaurants
278151,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Technically my fault Ended up not being able to stay on 1 of the nights I booked and was unable to cancel it At 220euro a night it was a little painful , The location was great although the car park was scary at first Pools were lovely and if you book a treatment in the spa its yours for the time your re in there Our room was on the 6th floor and we paid extra for a sea view watching the sun come up was amazing 
278152,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, We desperately wanted a spa treatment but after many calls and many trips down to the spa during operating hours we never saw or heard from a spa representative We tried for 4 days No one at the hotel was willing or able to give us an alternative, great location for water lovers
278153,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Our room was at the front side of the hotel it was very noisy in the night because of the strong traffic There is no balcony at this side of the hotel A lot of renovation would be needed at some place At the breakfast we couldn t find free place to sit , The location is good 15 min walk from the city and very close to the beach The breakfast is very rich the swimming pool is nice at the top of the hotel 
278154,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, I booked in early about four months before we stayed and upgraded our oom but was give the worst room near the ground floor close to the road The hotel didn t seem full so not sure why this happened The staff were okay but not that helpful Wouldn t recommend staying here ,No Positive
278155,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Humidity in the bathroom all the time water under the door toilet and shower Very slow to no wifi maybe temporary Quality foods drinks rooftop bar, location close to the sea Short taxidrive to the centre
278156,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Lack of customer service no communication from staff rude staff no interest in resolving problems thoroughly unimpressed with a supposed 5 star hotel, The location and the pool
278157,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, chambermaid their work is not well done she did not complete the missing things in the bathroom , friendly staff at reception and restaurant breakfast excellent location
278158,Pullman Barcelona Skipper,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful and nice to have a choice of pools Great location close to beach nightlife restaurants public transport 
278159,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Found it very difficult to get a sun bed throughout the day the wait for the lift was very long spa only had one masseuse on site so couldn t book a spa treatment at the same time as my partner , Thought the reception staff were exceptional Location to beach was excellent only 20 minutes from the airport and only a short taxi ride into the centre Room was very good size 
278160,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Where to start first of all this is 3 star service at best not 5 star but you still pay 5 star prices The staff is untrained not welcoming at all the reception supervisor is simply rude at one point he even hung up the phone on us The elevators are painstakingly slow most guests simply start using the stairway out of frustration even when staying at the top floors that s how slow they are The rooms are not quiet at all the building is designed in an L shape with the pool and main restaurant right below creating a constant noise of either dining or swimming hotel guests or both The glass sides of the shower cabin in the bathroom are not fully waterproof leaving a puddle of shower water along the toilet the whole day Toiletries are not replaced on a daily basis and to top it all off the complementary water is only offered at the day of check in And then lastly we first got charged 100 EUR more upon check out check your bill before paying ,No Positive
278161,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Service lacking for a 5 star hotel For example we had to ask 4 times for an ice bucket to be delivered before it arrived Requested a double room but given a twin Asked maid to come back in an hour to clean room and did not reappear Also no courtesy room or place to shower once you check out was disappointing as had a late flight , Great location near the beach and easy walk into town Good breakfast with good choice and service Lovely roof top pool with friendly staff Room nice although smelled of smoke and excellent shower 
278162,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, Nothing , The location was great for walking the city and getting to the beach just a few feet away The rooftop pool was very nice and the staff were always very nice and helpful When I called about the room temp being too warm it was addressed in short order and the room made very comfortable 
278163,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, It was a little noisy at night There was music playing in the foyer which travelled up to the rooms but it didn t go all night fortunately , The bed was the most comfortable as well as the pillows The view was amazing 
278164,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, We booked a deluxe king room and ordered a bottle of champagne on arrival When we arrived to the room there was no champagne although confirmed by the reservation department and there was a broken chair which was fixed immediately The room was nice but not deluxe compared to standard rooms expected more from a 5 star property at this price range , Two swimming pools to relax close to the beach free loan of beach towels Good selection of food for breakfast and very helpful staff 
278165,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, The staff at this hotel were appalling except one It is a very busy hotel and I assume because they have such high capacity they think they can get away with being rude and unhelpful Everything we asked the reception staff was too hard Every request impossible Everything was our fault Not the attitude you want to put up with when you are travelling with small children We stayed for 3 nights over a weekend The hotel was full every night yet there was no General Manager working Thank God for Ben on reception or I would probably still be waiting for someone to fix my door that wouldn t lock because I supposedly wasn t doing it right It was actually a flat battery in the swiper when someone finally came to look at it Just one problem in the list of many that I could recite from our stay here We were disappointed with our stay here to say the least and it spoilt our time in Barcelona , This hotel is pretty comfortable and nice and close to the beach It is great to have the option of a couple of pool areas to take a swim when the weather is hot 
278166,Pullman Barcelona Skipper, No hose for the toilet noise from the next rooms small room I stayed in many 5 stars hotels but this hotel may be equal to 4 star, Wife fast check in breakfast
