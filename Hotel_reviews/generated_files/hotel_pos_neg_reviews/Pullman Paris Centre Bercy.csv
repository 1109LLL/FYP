12697,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, Fairly bland business hotel but excellent value and location , Excellent location close to both the gares de Lyon and Bercy and the lovely Bercy Park and the Bercy village with plenty of lively restaurants and bars Very good breakfast Helpful staff 
12698,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, Would have been nice to have breakfast however at E29 per person was way beyond our budget , The hotel staff were very friendly and competent The hotel is very close to both bus and Metro stations We were there for Bastille day celebrations and found it very easy to get to and from the Eiffel tour for the superb fireworks display Bercy village has a fine selection of restaurants and small shops Bercy 2 is a good shopping Mall only 1 stop away from the hotel by bus 
12699,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, The hotel doorman was the rudest and most incompetent staff I have ever met I asked him to call me a taxi for the airport and he got me one coming after 20 Minutes While there was a line of taxis right at the corner Having seen that I asked him to watch my luggages time for me to see if I can get another one at the street corner the man refused saying I am on my own Finally I went with my stuff and got the taxi immediately since 10 of them where queuing Worst groom ever , Excellent facilities
12700,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, No food after 11pm at the bar but yes as room service, All fine the spa is just a sauna and for some reason after 11pm they don t serve food at the bar but they do deliver to the room not a very good policy For the rest all fine 
12701,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, Hardly any vegetarian options, Very good hotel and I was happy with the service I got there The staff members were very friendly and extremely helpful Absolute value for money compared to the crazy hotel prices in Paris I was supposed to pay much before I checked in since it was a booking that couldn t have been cancelled For some reason the hotel was unable to charge my card I requested them to wait till I arrived for my stay to pay in advance and they gladly accepted that and waited for me Mentioning this because I have had instances before where even 5 star hotels have not waited and cancelled my booking So great job by Pullman Bercy and would absolutely recommend this to others It is close to Cour De Saint Emilion metro station to Bercy Village and a couple other places where one can hang out 20 mins away from Triumph de Arc at Champs de Elysees which is one of the tourist spots too Good coffee for breakfast and has a great yellow coloured apricot bread which one must try for sure 
12702,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, Very discourteous staff except people at the front desk Rooms too small Beds uncomfortable Housekeeping and service staff rude, The lobby and front desk staff were very helpful
12703,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, Bar service was a bit uneven given that it was the end of the evening and they appeared to have been very busy before They recovered though , Checking process was outstanding Superb front area staff and service focus some of best ever experienced Local restaurant and bar options were great Nice safe neighborhood and close to the metro station 
12704,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, Their room service I asked for tow empty glasses to my room they told me I will pay 5 or I can come myself to take them from bar and this what I did , The reception they are very friendly and welcoming
12705,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, The food options available under room service were less But then again it is so close to some really amazing cafes and restaurants at Bercy that one can quickly step out to grab a meal if they do not want to leave the hotel , Everything was great Me and my partner had planned a short visit to just be with each other and the place was perfect for that I will highly recommend this hotel

12732,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, The only thing that this property could use is a pool That would be the only thing that put this property over the top other than that there are no issues , Although the hotel was located in a business district it was very secluded It was also excessible to both taxi services and mass transit The hotel itself is beautiful it was clean and comfortable Although we only at there once the food was great I can t speak highly enough about the staff Flora Melanie Josephine to name a few were exceptional They made my wife and I extremely welcome and comfortable They were very helpful in suggesting not only places to visit but also provided directions on how to get there The whole entire staff made our stay even more enjoyable I highly suggest anyone visting this beautiful country should stay at the Pullman Thanks again guys

12736,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, The employees at reception desk seemed very busy and a bit artificial I did not feel they were very interested in the guests , I traveled with my husband and my daughter so we asked for a room with 3 independent beds The room was big enough for the 3 beds and we slept well The location of the hotel is very good Close to subway and there is a walk only street near the hotel where we found a lot of interesting restaurants and shops 
12737,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, Liquor prices Baileys Irish cream is way too expensive compared to premium whiskeys Ie 1 oz of Irish cream sells for 10 Eur compared to 1 oz of glemorange whiskey 13 Eur Knowing that that bottle of whiskey costs 4 times the bottle of Irish cream Dosage price should be reviewed relatively, Cleanliness staff breakfast

12740,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, Food is very expensive and parking at hotel is 30 Euro a night which I find way over priced for staying in the hotel Gym is extremely small could do with more leisure facilities especially with kids , Overall it was a lovely hotel clean and tidy lovey rooms Location was great with bercy village close round the corner We got the king duplex and was a good size Breakfast downstairs was great Staff are fantastic
12741,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, They did not change the bed sheets for the 6 nights and not able the cab park next to the main entrance I fell in the stones of the entrance, Staff was very gentile

12743,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy,No Negative, Staff was friendly and helpful Manager showed us to our room on check in Our room was up graded at check in because a room at the level we had requested was not yet available We were treated lavishly during our entire stay Could not have asked for more 
12744,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, room not set up for a woman unable to use hairdryer in bathroom assume for safety reasons so I had to plug it in by the desk No mirror near any of the outlets so had to use my FaceTime camera on my computer to look at myself while I dried my hair Located in a business center neighborhood while there is a metro line close by that goes straight into town without stops that s no substitution for being able to walk out the hotel and take a wander in the neighborhood That would not be recommended in this location not scenic and sidewalks walkways especially difficult along the Seine Unless you have business very close by this would not be the hotel for you Gare de Lyon is an arduous 30 minute walk if you walk fast and it s really difficult if you re hauling a suitcase even if it s small Of note when using Booking com you will not receive loyalty points you only get the points if you book directly That is really low , bed super comfortable staff friendly complimentary water in mini bar nice shower quiet
12745,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, Very strong air freshener smell in hallway on our floor, Room bed pillows wifi shower were great Location a bit out of town central area yet still close enough for easy access Lots of hip restaurants nearby at Bercy Village 
12746,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy,No Negative, The staff at the reception and the security were very pleasant when we arrived The housekeeping has been very helpful The location is a bit off from the center of Paris but there are still a lot to see and we can have good meals at various restaurant at the bazaar

12748,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, Little oversights here and there We were a group of three friends staying in one room but the extra bed didn t get made with the same fabulous comforter and they only provided one robe and slippers for the three of us Upon request an extra blanket was provided but not a proper comforter And I m sure we could have gotten extra robes as well if we had asked Another friend stayed in one of the upgraded rooms with a nespresso machine but the room hadn t been stocked with nespresso pods and it required a call to the front desk A very good place overall as I said it was just little things here and there that keep it from getting an even better score , Great breakfast buffet a bit of everything Bercy village is a cute little neighborhood with a great variety of restaurants to chose from And very easy to hop on metro to get to all the sites 
12749,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, TV in main room didn t work Lamp in main room didn t work Lighting wasn t the greatest broken lamp taken into consideration Fridge wasn t stocked up daily Valuable item of clothing went missing from our room, Staff were really helpful on arrival and made the checking in process a straight forward one Even took the time to show us an alternative room on arrival
12750,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, Tables for two at breakfast are a little too close but if you are in a bigger party you are more likely to be seated at one of the circular tables in the centre of the room Bar service is extremely slow on our third visit we actually gave up waiting , This is the second time we have stayed here and consider its location excellent it is on the edge of Bercy Village and just a couple of hundred metres away from a metro stop making it easy to get around On this occasion we had travelled out to watch France V England at Le Stade We were upgraded on arrival from Superior to Deluxe which was obviously appreciated although I m not certain how the rooms differed other than the free soft drinks mini bar The room was light spacious and spotlessly clean and the large bed afforded us two extremely comfortable nights sleep We managed to secure a deal with breakfast included which obviously made it better value Choices available are extensive so I defy anyone to not find something that appeals 
12751,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, On arrival despite booking a superior double room we were given a twin room on Valentine s Day When we went back to reception to tell them they had made a mistake the receptionist s quick solution was to say can we push them together for you Top marks for thinking on he feet but NO Eventually got given a different room two floors down The Bathroom towels were stained and dirty marks on the ceiling in the bathroom room service was very slow and the champagne glass had a chip which was very sharp We were informed breakfast was served until 11 00 on checking however on Monday when going down to the restaurant at 10 10 we were ushered away saying they were closed as they were only open until 1100 at the weekend 26 per person The iron in the room was broken this was replaced but the old one didn t get removed and got kept in the corner of the room Hoping this was only a one off , Great location close to the metro line 
12752,Pullman Paris Centre Bercy, I have seen 2 hours after your confirmation that you wrote nonsmokers preferred Therefore I wrote promptly a mail to you DIRECT to your mailadress with the exakt Name and date of booking and I want both rooms f r SMOKERS Sorry to say i did not receive ANY answer When we arrived the booked rooms habe not been available at 14 00 and not the following days and they habe been Nonsmokers From your really friendly personal I received no comment to this All other services have been pleasent and professional ,No Positive
