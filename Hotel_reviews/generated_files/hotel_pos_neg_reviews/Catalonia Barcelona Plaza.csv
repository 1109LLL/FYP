415168,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, The location for this hotel is fantastic Opposite the majic fountains The Aerobus to and farm El Prat airport stops directly outside and is only 5 90 and runs every 10 minutes You couldn t get a better location as the Placa Espanya is one of the main routes into the City I have to say Cristina on reception was so helpful and helped us so much 
415169,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, We were supposed to check in at 2 but the room wasn t ready until about 4 30 which they just made us wait in the lobby and kept saying it will be ready in 20minutes since 2pm The staff we re also really rude and I was made to pay the city tax twice when I checked in and out because they couldn t find it on the system , The pool and terrace
415170,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, Amazing family room on the 12th floor with fantastic views over the Magic Fountains Ultra modern furnishings and decor with iron ironing board minibar flat screen tv power shower and enough space for a small army Staff are super helpful and friendly Fabulous rooftop pool bar Second visit even better than the first We will be back 
415171,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, We got a nosy room probably the AC units were above us get moved in the middle of the night very quickly indeed but no electricity in the new room something was broken and they did t notice repair it , Rooms nice and clean Free coffee snacks water at each floor Friendly staff Location ok very close to subway station 
415172,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The walls were so thin I could hear neighbouring guests open and close their closets and drawers I panicked on the first morning because it sounded like they were showering in my bathroom What happened at 1am on Monday morning made me feel deeply uncomfortable I would have taken a cold shower but didn t want them to think someone was in their room It s always nice to hear cheery cleaning staff yelling to each other in the hallways though A final oddity there was a distinct lack of plug points so this was the first hotel I ve stayed at in many years where my phone hasn t been within arm s reach as it s charged overnight Having to march across the room and turn off my alarm rather than snoozing it for 2 5 hours was deeply distressing , I would go back for the rooftop pool alone It looks like a posh Ibiza resort but without the fat tourists hogging pool space at 8am The whole area was designed to make me feel way wealthier than I actually am and I loved every minute of it The room was huge The bathroom was so big I could fit a whole London hotel room in it I m such a terrible planner I didn t realise the hotel sits on Placa Espanya so if you get food poisoning like my travel companion you might be able to see one of Barcelona s most beautiful sites from your bedroom window Unfortunately my view was of a slum like alley 
415173,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Very lacking in customer service Staff weren t ready to help or assist and some members of staff didn t enjoy trying to converse with us in english which was very frustrating when we tried our best with our Spanish , Amazing location Metro outside your door Pool Room was gorgeous
415174,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Air conditioning unit was noisy and needs to be adjusted , Comfortable beds large room cleanliness beautiful bathroom in renovated executive room afternoon snacks on executive floor free wifi near public transport rooftop pool with cabanas 
415175,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The shower in the rooms was disappointing Bad pressure and the room cleaning staff could have done a better job, The rooftop pool and bar was amazing The view was stunning and it was good to spend time there
415176,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Nothing, Location superb staff very friendly upgraded us without our requesting so Pool area luxurious and views were superb Breakfast was tasty plentiful and choice was excellent Cannot rate this hotel high enough 
415177,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The room service options were limited and one time it took over an hour just to deliver a few salads , The room was great AC and wifi both worked well Staff very helpful in navigating around the city 
415178,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The staff at the reception was not very helpful I came 1 30 pm but made me wait before they gave the key to the hotel room after 2 00 pm check in time The lady also did not provide any additional details about various facilities at the hotel and transport etc as you would expect , Good location of the hotel 
415179,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Not being able to eat own food up at the pool Surely I have paid to be in the area so I can eat what I want Walls were very thin but still had a good night sleep , The bed was comfy and aircon was easy to use Pool was lovely and very friendly staff great view of the front of the hotel 
415180,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Minor issue corridors leading to rooms were bland and featureless The executive rooms came with refreshment throughout the day but this was allocated outside the lift area Would be much nicer in a dedicated executive lounge , Comfortable room which was sound proofed so no noise at night either from outside or other guests Terrace bar and pool were nicely situated on the roof and metro stop and airport bus right outside the door 
415181,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, I paid a substantially higher rate for a room with a terrace The terrace was a small space with just enough room for two stained sunbeds and was marked by short planters on the sun deck of the pool area The back of the pool bar was at one end of the terrace complete with noises of staff working and bottles being thrown into bins and crates There was no privacy people walked past and could look straight on to the terrace The foliage marked a boundary but did not screen Then there was the flicked cigarette incident where I could have been lying on the sunbed at the time and been burnt myself The terrace is a very expensive joke A bottle of water was presented to us on our first night and then that was it despite the room description stating that water would be in the room I shouldn t have had to ask for this to be given daily The bathroom had walk in shower which was badly lit and what I thought was a circular jacuzzi This turned out to be just a bath in a dark space with no direct electric light and a blind covered window as this opened out on to the pool deck For approximately 300 per night I would have expected a higher standard of facilities , Large airy and marbled communal areas with pleasant lobby Comfortable bed and spacious suite Kettle for beverages Staff responded quickly when problems arose e g sink plug was stuck the sunbed was burned by a flying cigarette end Excellent breakfasts and having the choice of being able to eat in the Gourmet Corner a smaller intimate dining space Staff were very friendly and helpful Excellent location for conferences at the Fira and for public transport 
415182,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Free upgrade on our way into Barcelona , I paid for the room upgrade on my way into Barcelons but the second upgrade on my way out of Barcelona was complentary This consideration and great staff service will keep me coming back to this specific hotel which offers quality amenities classy and smiling staff great location and always has taxis waiting 
415183,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Room had lack of mirrors and plug socks in appropriate places Only plug and mirror together was in the bathroom and that s no good when someone needs the toilet someone is in a shower and three others are waiting to get ready Also phoned reception a few times and they said they d be up immediately well a few hours later and we had to make another phone call but infuriating when waiting to go out, Staff very friendly great selection of food for breakfast
415184,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, while sitting in the restaurant they stole my wallet i asked the employees to see the cameras and call the police they were like ahh don t boder the police will not come and the cameras can be review only by the police left without money and documents had a flight in one hour and the only help they offered me to give me money for the shutttle and let have in mind that my flight was in a hour really not satisfied and in this kind of 4 star hotel that must not happen felt very unsafely,No Positive
415185,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The staff is not helpful AT ALL and I never did get the iron I requested to my room the five days we were there They literally didn t help out with any requests we had no help with getting around town We had to ask the nice people of Barcelona for help getting around town , Didn t have breakfast or dinner there so can t comment But the burgers at the rooftop pool were amazing Love the views from the rooftop pool The rooms are nice Metro was a great option as Uber doesn t operate there and the day we arrived the taxis were on strike Ask for a room with a view of the plaza We did but they couldn t get us there rooms were all taken 6th floor is newly renovated and are the executive suites 
415186,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Breakfast a bit on the expensive side for what food there was but not a complaint as it was still beautiful , Amazing location the roof top bar and pool were amazing 
415187,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Its was pricey and the room was small I ordered 3 beds 1 full and 1 twin They gave us a room with two twins pushed together and then had the porter bring in another twin bed very cramped for the price , Hostel was upscale and smelled great 
415188,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, First of all we were given a room at the front part with a beatiful view on the plaza and surroundings However the noice from the taffic was unbearable Despite my request at checkin the staff ensured me the room was quite This was a straight lie After I complained the next morning we were give another room at the back with a very poor interior view of the hotel but at least it was quiet and we could sleep well Umfortunately we could only occupy that room at 6pm Make sure they dont put you in one of those city view rooms Another inconvenience was that there are as good as no electric outlets to charge your phone and camera And also the beds are not very comfortable small and double beds are made out of two single that move apart as soon as you make a move which I hate , The location was perfect for us as we visited the Sonar festival We also liked the rooftop bar and pool a lot The breakfast buffet was top as well 
415189,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Could not find information about the hotel services in the room Prices for bar services are very upmarket level , Practical business location from the airport bus stops almost in front and runs every 10 minutes and 10 minutes from Sants AVE station For the touristic places of Barcelona it is 25 minutes walk or 12 minutes metro to Pla a Catalunya Complete services very nice the pool on the roof Excellent value for price if you get a discount rate otherwise normal 
415190,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, We didn t spend too much time at the hotel as we had an itinerary planned ahead of arrival We just wanted a good hotel which was central to our needs, The hotel was centrally located and we got to the attractions we had intended to visit with ease We particularly liked the snack table at the reception of the room floors Really nice treats
415191,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Conditioner was not working was constantly deistracted by staff from the hotel coming into my room while i was preparing for a meeting So for the first night i had to sleep in the classic room instead of Executive that i booked Second day they manage to fix the conditioner by the evning still i had to insist doing something about it The receptionist on arrival day was not particularly friendly as i expect from 4stars it felt like i am bothering him with questions the other staff were ok After all this they offered free breakfast and late chek out but i think they should of made a discount for the first night , The room is clean bath rob etc is present Breakfast is good not amazing but fare Location is good 
415192,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Toilets were a bit smelly and old Flush was not working properly Rooms were not perfectly cleaned Breakfast was rather expensive as there are excellent options in the area for a cheaper price Food service at the pool was a bit expensive for the quality provided There were few plugs in our triple room no possibility of charging our mobiles at the same time for example , Very well located nice walking distance to different points of attraction in the city metro stop nearby Aerobus stop just outside the hotel Super friendly professional staff at the reception Good Wi Fi connection Very nice pool on the rooftop with a great view Comfortable beds
415193,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Only negative was Air conditioner in our room required some attention as it seemed it was on its last legs, The best poolside burger experience we ve had in a long time Complimentary Nespresso coffee and tasty snacks provided with exceptional service by the wonderful Sandra on the executive floor 
415194,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, An amazing property in a fantastic location The best of both worlds where you can walk to famous landmarks or catch one of many buses taxis directly from outside the hotel for further afield sightseeing then relax on one of the oversized sun beds by the pool whilst taking in the amazing views 
415195,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Nothing, The location was great for everything we wanted to do Airport bus stopped outside the hotel as did the tour bus and the Metro Worth spending a bit more money for a room with a view The hotel pool and bar were amazing loved it 
415196,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Right this is the negative and I ve left writing this review to give the hotel chance to respond from our 5 5 17 trip Although our room was really lovely there was a really bad drain smell in the bathroom which got progressively worse We reported it every day but nothing was done We had to remember to keep the bedroom door closed as we cudnt sleep because of the smell the first night We couldn t find anywhere to plug the kettle in apart from the bathroom to be fair we kept forgetting to ask but we did search all over For 2 days with no advanced warning after settling ourselves all 15 of us on the Bali beds we wer told we had to vacate the area due to some function or other being held there by which time all the beds by the pool bar wer taken leaving us to sit on the floor and apart from each other Ok I accept these things happen but to not tell us that this wud be happening the following day as well was very poor customer service What can I say about the bar service except that it was practically non existent They left a poor girl who had absolutely no clue how to use the till what the prices of the drinks were to cope with 40ish people on her own It wasn t stocked properly and we waited nearly 2 hours for the most simple of bar meals they didn t even get that right It didn t really improve over the 3 days we wer there What an absolute shambles I think they were more concerned about the guests attending whatever functions they were holding than any of the actual guests staying paying at the hotel The final insult was at check out when asked if everything was ok with our room I mentioned the drain smelll how many times I had reported it and was told that s too bad Also they refused to call us 5 seater taxis for the airport so we had to pay for 4 when we only need 3 , We had a lovely rooftop room with terrace just steps away from the pool Huge bed and very comfortable indeed Masses of wardrobe space in room safe great shower everything you would expect for 200 per night Great rooftop pool with bar stunning views of Barcelona and a bonus quiet area with sofas coffee tables Bali beds really great if you re with a group of friends which we were All in all great hotel perfect location walk out the entrance turn left and the most amazing little deli on the corner very reasonable price wise Over the road is a mall with everything u could possibly want from a supermarket I d actually get my toiletries from there if I return lots of places for a quick bite to eat electrical clothes shops a very Pricey Barcelona F C Store Lots of taxis bus stops right outside hotel train station nearby
415197,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Expensive breakfast Comparing the room rate it should be included , The hotel is very nice We had double room exclusive on the 7th floor and it was just perfect Gym and spa on the same floor swimmimg pool and bar on the 8th floor Nice view from the pool bar not from the room Very clean and comfortable room perfectly equiped bath room toiletries mini bar coffe machine Metro station is just near the hotel s entrance and it is very easy to get anywhere Airport shuttle s stop is near the hotel and city bus nr 46 costs only 2 15 euro to get to the airport We did not have breakfast at the hotel bcs it was a bit expensive 20 euro person day We used to eat breakfast nearby for max 20 euro for 2 persons Shopping center and Tapa tapa restaurant is very close to the hotel Amazing area and Museum just 5 min walking distnce from the hotel Aprox 20 min walk to the Aquarium and port It was a pleasure to stay at the hotel the staff were very nice reception room service and concierge Check in was very quick and personal was very helpfull When we left hotel it was impossible to book taxi bcs of taxi drivers strike and it was rainy but the staff at the reception was not so helpfull as when we arrived 
415198,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Although it s not that important there was no direct elevator from the 6th floor until the rooftop bar and swimming pool I had to take the stairs which was fine for me or switching elevator on the ground floor This was not an issue for me personally but it might be for some travelers , The hotel was a good one which is rare for a 4 star hotel Although I m used to spend my nights at 5 start hotels the Hotel Catalonia Barcelona Plaza was quite satisfactory for me in general 
415199,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Noisy the doors shut down real loud and it s disturbing In the mornings no consistency hot cold water very unpleasent, Great view decent sushi restaurant great walking and running area
415200,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, First the air conditioning was broke in our room and the room smelled I asked three times for them to fix it and they didn t Also our room had major water damage and was very run down In addition there were dead bugs in the picture frame above bed Overall there was tons of damage to the room What it really needs is a complete overhaul My friends had a room as well and theirs was much better I would not ever stay here again on my trips to Spain , Access to Montjuic 
415201,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, 3rd bed not being made over the weekend, Room booked for 3 people 2 beds made other bed never made over the two nights even though I asked twice at reception and with the cleaning maids Very annoying after paying the high price 
415202,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, The location was amazing in Catalonia area The veiw was very beautiful in front of mountain with nice Mall beside the hotel The breakfast very nice The spa very clean
415203,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Staff very rude not helpfully at all I had two suits that I paid a lot of money for my dads 60th for a surprise and they stunk of the sewers we complained they said nothing we can do about that which I thought was horrendous Also didn t clean rooms correctly the window from our bathroom was steamed up 24 7 so could not sit in our bath to over look our views of Barcelona Then asked to use spa to freshen up after we had check out they said was fine so later went back to use the shower and refused us to use any of there facilities, Location was good
415204,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, Great value for price extremely clean and excellent view from the room Kind personnel and fast service we booked 1hr before effectively arriving to the hotel Did not have the time to enjoy all the facilities but would definitely recommend to anyone Perfectly connected with the metro to all the rest of the city and much more comfortable than many other places to reach the airport 15 mins taxi drive 
415205,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Staff at reception is super un educated Breakfast crew as well Concierge non existing Problem solving staff member laughed in our face Will definitely not return to this hotel Dinner at japanese restaurant was very good and worth the money , The bed
415206,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Booked for 15 days but wanted to check out early Refused to refund me even though I had free cancellation Ultimately was charged extra 1 night which I did not stay as penalty I was asked to pay for all 15 days in advance The hotel is a cheat No invoice was given nor receipt of payment when checked out ,No Positive
415207,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The only issue we had was when we came back on Friday evening to a wet floor which appeared to have come from next door We mopped up the water as it had partially dampened our suitcases and then went to bed The next morning it was ok slight amount of water but we did not report it as we didn t want to have to pack up and move rooms Photos attached Also there is a spread of water coffee apples and macarons by the elevators this was cleared away at a time I was craving an apple ok a macaron so it would be nice to keep the area fresh with fruit at least , Location was second to none directly facing the magic fountains The beautiful rooftop pool and cabanas enable this to be enjoyed to its fullest which recommend you allow time for to watch the show from at 9pm on Friday Saturday and avoid the hustle and bustle of the actual venue The room was spacious and clean the shower was amazing 
415208,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, This is not a complaint but just an advice from a professional a Wayfinding could be improved especially to the special facilities Have a professional look at it b Lighting is generally an issue As a rule of thumb make sure you can t see the source of light and only illuminate surfaces you need to see , We got upgraded to a large suite apartement with a view over Pl Espanya We chose the hotel because of its location so that a shuttle bus to the airport was quick and easy 
415209,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Noisy lift close to this years room, Excellent location Fantastic views from rooftop pool and the junior suite we booked last year I my opinion hard to better anywhere 
415210,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, I traveled with my Little daughter 3 yo and we Had a Bad experience with another Hotel and Switched to this one I Wished we Stayed longer there was fantastic Next Time I am in Barcelona ill definitly will stay there Airport Bus is also Directly leaving Infront of the Hotel Even It is at a big and Loud place thanks to the good windows we slept deep and Long 
415211,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, See above commemts, We were upgraded to floor 6 where they provide tea and coffee and sometimes snacks bit hit and Miss in the lift lobby area coffee and tea making facilities in the room slippers and dressing gowns in the room and marble surfaces but the room did not have a view or a proper third bed and was dingy so we downgraded ourselves to a bright airy nice smelling triple corner room 440 with a fabulous panoramic view of the museum and fountains and las arenas an old bull ring now a shopping mall The downsides were lower grade facilities really poor shower smaller tv but we weren t there to watch to lack of plug sockets or badly positioned so not to accommodate a travel plug no extra bedding in the room we asked for a kettle twice but it never materialised The beds and bedding were lovely so if great view and comfy beds are ur priority like us u will be fine We had a late flight and had to check out at 12 and the hotel looked after our cases for the day but there is no curtesy room or area to wash and dress for the return flight We didn t have breakfast at 20 we just went to a cafe round the corner for fresh croissants and illy coffee Metro right outside hotel and can walk to museum and have threat view of fountains that come on 9 10 thu fri and sat nights and poble Espanyol and Olympic park are within walking distance
415212,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Being on the 7th floor meant we were under the pool area and the loud music from the bar could be felt in our room All rooms should have heated towel rails we had one but it did not work though we did not mention it we stayed with our family who were in a separate room and they did not have one , The breakfast was very good and the staff were excellent and very accommodating It is great there are a few computers in the lobby for guests and the bonus was a printer It was out of ink but the staff behind the desk were great as they printed out the things we needed after we emailed them The location is near a large museum We like walking and did not mind the 1 hour stroll to La Rambla though we did use the train and the station was right outside the hotel The bus to the airport also stopped right outside the hotel Our room had a large safe large bed very nice pool area and good views 
415213,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, As in Spain always service is a bit slow but ok , The sun deck is awesome Great place for lonely travellers to meet people A lot of young single travellers 
415214,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Lots of children some rooms are noisy you can hear other people entering the elevator etc Location of the hotel is nearby not really in the centre so we had to travel by cab for 5 days additional 175 euro , Great room good view 
415215,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, A little softer mattresses in the room , The employees was fantastic and the pool on the roof was amazing As well as staying at the 6th floor we loved it 
415216,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, We have stayed here before and feel it is becoming a little tired and in need of attention to avoid decline eg our air conditioning was not working properly , Location very close to 2 metro lines tourist bus and airport bus magic fountain etc 
415217,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, Excellent location very close to metro beautiful view on Plaza Espana from our suite We were there for the third time together with our small son and will come again this was our first choice and it is simply perfect Delicious breakfast comfortable beds spacious rooms Nespresso available the rooftop pool The staff is very friendly and helpful and the service is excellent 
415218,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The room are stinking from cigarettes the bathroom has stains of mold everywhere The bedding and sheets had stains like 2 Motel, It is in a good location
415219,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Reception operation took huge time for receiving calls and other people It was uncomfortable in busy time, Location is good and the view from the room was nice to see Placa Espana and a museum
415220,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, I liked everything, The staff were really awesome and drew me maps they d heat up the milk bottle for my baby boy Really friendly nice
415221,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, I cannot find anything to complain about In high season the prices are much higher so plan accordingly, My room floor had been remodeled very tastefully it was very luxurious everything one could wish for the view was unbeatable At the elevator lobby on my floor there were free drinks and coffee etc The staff at the counter was reindly and efficient the doorman inside was classy 
415222,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Just perfect No worries, That was unbelievable We were given Suite for the only one night we were going to spend in the Hotel instead of the cheapest room booked with 55 discount and the room was stunning huge Plaza view enormous beds nice bathrooms 2 seat bath with Arenas view Welcome drinks Hotel restaurants discounts 
415223,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, A little too expensive, Great location very easy to reach very close to the train station and bus stop very helpful cheerful and well informed staff close to most of the city s main attractions
415224,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Really bad staff Cheated with mini bar products We use Products of 12 50 eur from minibar and they charge us 30 at reception and i paid and went out And after some hour i thinked the products i used how many and went back to hotel and asked so they return me 17 50 eur and told system error Matter not money Matter is how they atend us And not say sorry no nothing Not friendly staff bad impresion of reception staff ,No Positive
415225,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Maybe a tea kettle in the room wouldve been more convenient , Fabulous room on the 11th floor incredibly spacious with a beautiful view of the fountains just beside the shopping mall with rooftop restaurants Great breakfast and friendly staff If you prefer to eat in you won t be disappointed Filigrana restaurant is a delight with five star service 
415226,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Can t fault this hotel, 20 minute walk to the city centre Around 6 from the city centre to the hotel in a taxi Loads of places to eat Airport bus right outside the hotel and you can get a return ticket from the airport to the hotel and back for 10 90 The view from our room was amazing and the room was huge and very clean The safe in the hotel was easy to use and made us feel secure The Bar was very nice and we got a free welcome drink of our own choice the bar had football on the TV in the evening which was a bonus There is an arena shopping centre across the road with a lot of shops places to eat such as subway and ice cream crepe places as well as a supermarket The hotel was worth the 4 stars if not 5 stars the staff were very polite and it was easy checking in and out 
415227,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, On my bed and the bathroom floor where womens hair wasn t a big problem just didn t give a supreme clean feeling Through all over the place was clean , Very nice hotel great location good and modern rooms friendly staff The rooftop with pool is offering an amazing view over Barcelona 
415228,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, No air conditioning hotel is climatised but it was stuffy without opening the window The road noise is very loud with or without the windows opened Could do with better soundproofing , View from room was amazing Location was really superb Airport shuttle right by the front door Nice bar 
415229,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, When we booked the hotel the main thing we wanted was the air con The hotel is misleading customers because they said the is no air con in the winters time when it is clearly displayed on the website and does NOT mention that its seasonal We complained about this misleading information The staff said there is nothing we can do at first They also lied that they had no rooms left to upgrade us When we checked on the website 5 mins later there was still rooms available Also if you want to use the Gym there will be a queue In the whole hotel they only have 1 treadmill 1 bike and 1 Elliptical machine Anybody reading this review think carefully before booking this hotel for your own money, The Location
415230,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, Oscar at the reception was most helpful and courteous he recognized the fact that I am a faithful client and went above normal to make sure my stay would be as pleasant as possible Such reasons explain why I plan to keep coming back multiple times over this year 
415231,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, I received a free room upgrade which was a very pleasant surprise The suite allocated to me had an excellent view of Pla a Espanya and the mountains The suite itself was beautiful I did not want to leave Many thanks to the staff for the excellent hospitality and facilities 
415232,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Absolutely nothing Having extensively checked out huge swathes of barcelona during our stay my fianc e and I can hand on heart say there s not one hotel we saw that we d rather have stayed at Perfectly located for views for public transport both rail and bus including airport transfer and for feeling safe and secure It ticks every box , A fantastic hotel in a wonderful location with fabulous views of la plaza d espanya and montjuic The rooftop pool area offers simply breathtaking 360 views of barcelona and is a great place to relax whilst taking in the hustle and bustle below Staff professional courteous friendly ever helpful we can t praise the hotel highly enough 
415233,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, I found the staff to be average It took a long time to check in I don t know why as the reception wasn t busy I enquiried about the rooftop bar and was told it wasn t open at this time of year This was fine but another guest informed me that there was a beautiful view of the city from the roof of the Avenues next door I was surprised that the receptionist hadn t told me this At one point I went in to reception to ask a question and waited several minutes although there were 5 or 6 staff behind the counter doing different things No major issues but would expect better from a 4 hotel , The breakfast was delicious and there was great variety The location was perfect 
415234,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, fantastic staff so lovely we got upgraded to celebrate engagement was amazing huge suite views incredible bar nice bit dissapointed no pool but massage was good good location spa was nice loved it all thank u so much xx

415236,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The bar is not a very inviting place to enjoy a drink at the end of the day very small and clinical Also if you mind the sound of street traffic from your room you should think again or make a specific request for a quiet room The majority of this hotel sits and faces one of the busiest plazas for traffic in Barcelona , Rooms are comfortable 
415237,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The ATM in the lobby never returned my card or dispensed the money I tried too withdrew Staff at reception didn t seem to care though there was nothing they could do I was in a bit of a panic , This is a really nice hotel We only had one night though so missed out on a lot of great features of the hotel The metro is right out side the door and the bus stop a few steps away The view is amazing Staff is competent and helpful 
415238,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, My experience was bad due to the no AC policy during winter which was desperately needed to get rid of the paint smell , Great location especially during new year and wonderful service 
415239,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Misinformation about restaurant room service hours during December 24th to 26th Due to the holidays things were functioning differently but it was not advised properly and we would spend some time deciding what to eat only to call and be advised that that restaurant was not serving on that particular day , Great location and overall service
415240,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Room temperature We had to transfer to another room even , Customer Service is really friendly and very helpful on queries and support needed Even helped me find my lost luggage 
415241,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Adults were given a special price on breakfast but not children at age 8 and 10 It will be good if they give children under 12yrs old free breakfast or at least half price like in many other hotels , The Coffee machine was really good serving excellent expression coffee The view from the upgraded hotel room was really nice 
415242,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Nothing All good, Location location Location Stroll to the Musical Fountain Metro station below hotel Cafes and Arena Shopping Mall adjacent 4 stops on subway to Catalyuna Metro Station for access to La Rambla Hop on Hop off tourist bus nearby Perfect location Staff were helpful too We stayed over the quieter Christmas period
415243,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Bit noisy in the early morning noise from the road becaus this hotel is located beside the Plaza Espanya Breakfast was nice but expensive considering the price , Room was clean and comfortable Location good accessibility to the airport and city center 
415244,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The 10 cochroaches we had to kill Sweathy handmarks on doors you should vipe off the doors once in a while , Suite for a very good price great view Truely soundroof windows 
415245,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, When asked if I want to leave my towel and use it for another day and it s taken away that annoys me Why ask I also didn t need a new bar of soap each day Waste like that is not good for the environment , Location right on the Plaza Espana 
415246,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, We were upgraded to a tower suite with fab views Staff happy to let our daughter who was staying in a basic room whilst at a conference nearby come into the reserved breakfast area with us Although noisy with traffic outside the interior was very quiet 
415247,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Generally the hotel was not bad the room was clean One main gripe what hotel doesn t allow you to adjust the air con room temperature Mentioned this to the reception was advised that as it s winter the cool option on the air conditioning had been switched off for the whole hotel I wouldn t stay here again or any other hotel that s part of this chain If I can t even do the basic things like adjust the temperature in my room or make a cup of tea or coffee , Nice bed clean room

415251,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Staff is untrained Cleaning of the room is only doing your bed and changing the towel I had forks and knife I used first day laying on the table til I left the hotel Due to the location Plaza Espanja its lot of noise didn t sleep well because of this Also lot of dust coming in when you open the window from the traffic as well as from the air conditioner There was a door man security man who should help customers didn t speak any basic english Just for simple question you need to turn to reception where was limited people and they also had taking phone responsibility Not efficient Breakfast Saturday Sunday mornings most of the trays were empty not filled in you could see that they dont have enough capacity to follow the needs Average breakfast, City view from the room Japanese restaurant they have in their facilities not operated by the hotel 
415252,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Breakfast wasn t great Pastries did not taste fresh and hot food wasn t that hot, We are a family of 6 Children aged 9 17 Hotel was excellent very clean and staff were extremely efficient and friendly My only point would be to ask for a room at the back if your prefer quiet over view 
415253,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, the staff on arrival we had arranged with one of the receptionists to settle our bill on the monday we got up that morning to go out and returned about 15 15 we could not get into our room we went down to reception only to be told this was because we had not paid our bill I explained that we had arranged that we would be doing this today the receptionist still stood there i then asked if we could get back to the room in which she replied that the bill needed to be settled I then asked her how she expected me to settle the bill as all my belongings wallet and money were all in the safe in my room I asked her did she not think this was an extreme thing to do to a customer lock them from their room when everything was in the room plus they had details of my bank card was it not more polite to just leave us a message she did not reply to this an arranged for us to get back into the room we came down later to settle the bill there was another receptionist who asked if everything was ok we explained to her everything that had happened explained we were very upset to be treated this way especially when we have stayed at this hotel on many occassions She told she would look into this and report back to us We had another 3 days and within this time we did not hear from anyone we also wrote a letter of complaint to the general manager and have still not heard anything On booking out staff were very unfriendly and did not even ask us about our stay Due to this we will never stay at this hotel again Our stay was not cheap as we had booked one of the better rooms we feel we have been treated very badly , the facilities and location good we have stayed in this hotel many times bus and trains run every 10 15 minutes many places to eat and drink very good area 
415254,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The hotel services were pretty pricey including laundry or the restaurant but there a lot of places to eat nearby , Fantastic service and location Rough near the train station and within easy walking distance to a lot of attractions Right across a tragic circle to the museum 
415255,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The extra bed could have been more comfortable taking into account it was for an adult , Beakfast was well presented and included a wide variety of different food you could order an omelette or scrambled eggs on the spot and watch how ti was being made No problem about asking for extra pillows or for anything at all

415264,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, I had to pay slightly more than the price I booked for It might be the exchange rate The tv in the room wasn t working properly , My room was next to the terrace with swimming pool The room standard was very good bathroom was excellent with a large jacuzi The view from the terrace was amazing facing Plaza Espana Beautiful
415265,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The room was super cold you need to turn down the A C and provide blankets For people that like cold rooms its great but for me I am very sensitive to the cold so it wasn t good from that point of view Also the pillows are not super comfortable The only problem I had was that I needed to stay an additional night and the hotel was overbooked and the prices has changed dramatically I really didn t like that In addition that week I was there all hotels were pretty much booked fully and made it a unpleasant for me to leave in that manner , Overall it was great being at this hotel The staff is wonderful the room is clean The mall is three mins away However for people that shop as a sport might not find this mall super exciting There is a great range of high class restaurants around 6 and international cuisine The stores inside the mall are alright there is no zara for that you will have to go to the other malls El corto ingles is an okay mall but no restaurants other than the cafeteria The national museum is within walking distance Its wonderful on Saturday the entrance is for free The hotel has many restaurants It was overwhelming to pick one You can walk to different places from this hotel The pool is wonderful The view is great

415268,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Staff at reception desk not very forth coming As stood at reception desk plenty of staff but no one offered to help Not very welcoming , The pool area was nice Staff there was friendly 
415269,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, standard rooms are a little out dated need a refresh On the third floor there was a smell or drains in the hallway, great service nice staff great rooftop pool
415270,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Everything comparing to the price the room was horrible No staff to take our luggage we took it by our self to the room Lot of kids and noise in the lounge Minimum facilities in the rooms, Nothing
415271,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, we were given 3 dirty rooms before finally getting a clean room bathroom had hairs all over the bath and toilet also dirty glasses and empty bottles left on bedside staff were not very helpful or apologetic about this at the bar there was no continuity with drinks you could get a cocktail that was delicious and go up for the same thing with someone different making it and it wouldn t be the same , pool and rooftop bar were amazing in direct view to magic fountain show which you could watch eating your dinner great location very central to everything metro right outside hotel which was easy and cheap to use 
415272,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Room wasn t ready until about 4pm which was painful having been on a flight for 25 hours However the service room and facilities of the hotel made up for it , The breakfast was phenomenal and the rooftop bar pool was relaxing and delightful Beds were super comfortable and the view from my room was lovely overlooking the Monjuic Fountain Location of the property was spot on 
415273,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Did not feel welcomed at all It takes ages to check in and you need to ask for everything Very basic hotel 3 star hotels are even better in Barcelona, Nothing i liked
415274,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The grouting on the bathtub wall needs regrouting Not nice to look at Other than that is superb , Location Our room was facing the Plaza Espana Absolutely stunning view 
415275,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Breakfast is not good Staff at breakfast is not friendly and are always more interested in finishing their shift than if someone needs anything Shower was not good No pressure at all Mini bar is poor too , Then pool and bar are awesome The view from the pool or rooms is awesome as well Location is excellent 
415276,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Rooftop bar was amazing but prices of rum changed intermittently upon which staff member served us Me found a small piece of feaces under one of our beds in the room after a strong discussion it was not from any of our party it had a negative impact on our stay after that, Rooftop bar was amazing pool was well maintained and cleaned
415277,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Staff very poor in service No blankets at the hotel we slept with only sheetes to cover the kids Requested during the two nights but the answer that they don t have it I had a nother reservation at the same location which thankfully I cancelled , Location only
415278,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, the pool was always full with no seating area people were there from 7 in the morning and stayed all day we were told that breakfast ended at 11 but it was 10 30 during the week and we only had bread and had to pay full price the room next to us was very noisy and we had to ask them to keep it down , the staff was friendly and the second days breakfast options were great we missed the first day 
415279,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Booked a double room we was given a room with two single beds pushed together and made up as single beds Identified this as an issue with reception and was informed that the hotel had been over booked and that their was nothing that we could do required to pay on arrival before seeing the room requested that we pay extra for an upgrade this was also not an option So was left dissatisfied with beds that split apart during the night for 4 nights No apologies and acknowledgment from staff for the discomfort Unable to have a sunbed around the pool due to not being enough sun loungers for the guests , Excellent location wonderful views from the roof top pool and bedroom 
415280,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Sink did not drain in the shower or sink Pretty gross I expect more for 700 Cdn or 500 Euros Pool was over crowded with not enough chairs Staff everywhere was snooty One many yelled at my son in the foyer for resting on the sofa after flying 24 hours Smiling could go a long way to make people feel at home , Great location located right on the subway Nice bunk beds Room was clean new Great coffee and nice treats sent to welcome us Nice to get a free glass of wine Beautiful view of the square 
415281,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, We have no complaints, The view from our room was stunning It was very convenient in the sense that ithere was a taxi rank at the front of the hotel and a shopping centre across the road and several restaurants and coffee shops nearby It was an easy 20 minute walk to La Rambla and Pl Catalunya which we found a little too chaotic after a few hours The staff was most courteous and polite 
415282,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, Great hotel next to Arenas Mall priced as a 4 star hotel but definitely has a 5 star feel to it Lobby always has piano player playing at night and roof top bar during day or night is as good as any I ve seen anywhere in world 
415283,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Hotel feels a bit tired Reception a bit slow and busy Rooms on floor 6 not well sound proofed Very large hotel with lots of guests always busy especially the pool area , Great location close to metro that takes you everywhere in the city Upgraded to a suite on check in Nice pool and rooftop bar Good housekeeping Nice breakfast but expensive
415284,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The staff at times were dismissive No iron or safe locks for the room , This hotel was in the heart of the City Great location Near restaurants night clubs and Museums The Metro subway right outside the hotel 
415285,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Our room safe did not have a key for first 24hours of our stay due to the hotel not having enough for every room I thought this was poo especially when the room cost over 100 per night , We loved the roof top pool and views from there 
415286,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Staff at reception were rude Late check in after three o clock Food wasn t good don t bother eating in the hotel the food was not up to par for a four star hotel No locks for our safes the whole time we were there , The pool was amazing Pool staff were very nice Rooms were clean Curtains were blackout Surrounding area was lovely also the Brasa Grill just down the street was AMAZING Other restaurants were only so so 
415287,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, No balcony No kettle faciltities in room for drinks Food wasnt included , Massive bed Room Cleaned daily Very spacious Staff very helpful and polite
415288,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, On occasion there was sewer smell in hall way on Westside of floor , The location was perfect to nearby attraction and public transportation The scenery was great and staff always helpful
415289,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Long queues at reception Slow service Hot breakfast station not on hot plates so bacon sausages etc were coldish Room service terrible There is a coffee come tea maker in the room and the tea was missing so I asked for some and it came after 45 minutes By that time we were dressed for breakfast , The view from the room was fantastic across the Plaza Espa a Tube station right outside to go anywhere in Barcelona Bathroom had a lovely big bath Very clean room We were in a superior double room Breakfast had a a lot of food stations with a station just for omelettes or fried eggs Roomy and relaxed breakfast room 
415290,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The staff is dry and not very welcoming There are no plugs for any electronics near the bed The room service staff when they pick up the phone barely speak English The SPA staff is HORRIBLE One of the days I went to the pool there were no more towels left and so I asked the pool staff member where they were and his response was that he didn t know and that s it Also they had a wedding party that literally took up half the pool area and good luck getting an elevator with all of them checking in Bags EVERYWHERE in the lobby , Decent Pool with nice views 
415291,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Staff were very unhelpful and often rude Hotel was very noisey on a morning and evening Very uncomfortable beds Very expensive for drinks and quality pretty poor , Location of the hotel was good 
415292,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Our suite was located at floor 12 and we were traveling with 1 3 Y O kids and stroller unfortunately elevator just reach 11 floor and we could not climb up to our room with the stroller When we discover this it was too late so we decided to leave stroller at reception and take both kids with us By the time they were slipping it was hard time , Facilities at suite was very good outside environment at swimming pool at 8 floor was good We also took our dinner at main restaurant not the Japanese was also very good And really close to Montjuic Fountain which can also be seeing from the room excellent view 
415293,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The service in the rooftop bar was lovely during the day but lacked a bit of service in the evening constructive criticism only Room was nice but a little dated in terms of decor and corridors were so hot not like the cool reception and rooms , We loved the views and the roof terrace was lovely Good friendly service all round the lady on arrival at the front desk was extremely welcoming exactly what you want on arrival as they say first impressions really do count 
415294,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Drinks in pool bar a bit pricey , Rooms quiet beds comfy great views roof top pool and terrace a great sanctuary and different offer day and night Staff really professional helpful and personable Location great for getting into the central areas the airport or stations 
415295,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The triple room we were allocated was a bit tired and shabby We asked for other room options and the receptionist was really helpful and did not question our criticism of the room We ended up in a refurbished large double room which easily accomated an extra bed for our daughter no extra charge I think the rooms need some tlc so careful which you book nothing too much of an issue but you know how bathrooms get after a lot of use cracked tiles stained sealant etc , Roof top pool and sunbathing area excellent also good bar not too pricey Beds comfy our room had nice city view Excellent breakfast choice Location in a quieter area but still plenty going on Nice shopping centre next to hotel which had some nice restaurants on top floor 
415296,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Room was non smoking but stunk of cigarettes and the aircon didn t work We also found that people put their towels on the sun beds at 9am and wouldn t return to the pool until midday meaning there was hardly any room by the pool The pool also had a playlist on repeat all day every day with a total of 5 songs made it quite unbearable Bar was good and bar staff really friendly but basics like water and coffee were too expensive Spa staff were incredibly rude and snappy would not recommend the spa to anyone , Location was great and the bar pool facilities very good
415297,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Pool area was way to busy No sunbeds free unless you wake up at 8am and screaming kids everywhere in hotel Even nice rooftop pool area is filled with kids Reception was like a youth club with large school like groups everywhere Please also note that only 1 iron exists in hotel had to wait for 1 hour to use Room was nice but very dated ,No Positive
415298,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Didn t receive what I ve asked for on my booking check in and room was late according to the staff because they wanted to make sure it s clean After I came to the room shower wasn t working and I sow huge man hair all over the bath Very disappointing A welcome drink was issued next day also in my room there was no water to drink as you arrive Breakfast stuff was asleep plenty of things were missing and was only 9 AM Breakfast was going on till 1030 So many kids around the pool is it was hard to relax Didn t really get the idea of closing the pool at 8 PM Should be open a bit longer than that , My room service and cleaning every day was a really nice Staff around the pool was very friendly and helpful Food from the grill was great 
415299,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The hotel is old and the first room they gave us was old and dark The curtains were dirty The bathroom was ancient this was in the main building However when I complained they switched me to a newer part of the hotel which the room was better, Location of the hotel was convenient Easy access to all sightseeing
415300,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The pool area was full from morning until evening and people reserved seats without using them which I felt could have been managed with a simple system It took more than 2 hours to get an iron when I got it there was no iron board The staff bringing the iron were rude It also took more than 24 hours to get an extra pillow in the end I got one myself The price was high for the standard of room old decor on the second floor , The rooftop pool area was nice barmen were very nice and the pool and seating area was great with great views The AC in the room was very good and if it had not been the comfort level would be far worse so that was great Cleaning staff were nice and our room was well cleaned Shopping centre next door was very convenient and nice food in there too 
415301,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Unfortunately the cleaning was not very good Meaning the cleaning lady was everyday coming but maybe not so in the mood of working , The position of the hotel is very good and there is the metro stop in front of it 10min and one is on the Rambla or promenade Very spacious room no hearing rumor from other rooms and the bed was so comfortable Bedding and towels very clean The breakfast is generous and satisfies the taste of everyone The personal is all very professional and polite and the Wi fi it s working very good 
415302,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, This hotel is too big and the staff can t handle the crowd No direct access to the swimming pool from the main lift So you have to go to the ground floor and take another lift Quite annoying , The swimming pool is amazing with a great view 
415303,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The airconditioning in the room could not deal with the temp Consequently the room was pretty warm , Very nice location close to metro station camp nou and montjuich The Staff is very nice and supportive 
415304,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Took ages to check in and then had to wait 45 minutes from room to be ready however we were given a complementary drink at the rooftop pool bar while we waited ,No Positive
415305,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The terrace got very busy so it was often difficult to get a sun bed, The room was very comfortable and the terrace was beautiful with an amazing view 
415306,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, We arrived around 11 00pm and the kitchen had just closed even for bar snacks , Location to the airport with free shuttle bus Transfer to the cruise port was well timed and only 11 
415307,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, People should not be allowed to leave towels on sun loungers then go away for a few hours , Loved the pool terrace area was excellent Even better than the pictures 
415308,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, We hated the ball games in the pool and the unsupervised young rude obnoxious Arabic kids running around screaming and the pool area is too small for ball games We stayed for a week and this happened on 3 days sadly , We liked the pool and the bar a lot and the location and the views
415309,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Staff not friendly bathroom has a number of problems shower was broken and it took us 3 days for someone to fix wash basin was blocked and again it took us another 3 days for someone to fix it, Location
415310,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Pool discussing and crowded and bed smelly and room very poor Bath was disgusting and I would not recommend anyone to come here, Old worn down and not good at all
415311,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, We had a basic room which was ok but for a 4 to have no tea making facilities was a joke You only get those with upgraded rooms and free water I believe You do have a mini bar what you pay for but can store your bottled water in as fridge a good size , Rooftop pool and bar Views of city and fountains are spectacular Beds and pillows are so comfortable City tour bus stops opposite hotel Information booth opposite hotel where you can pre book all tickets tours etc 2 day ticket for tour bus is better value for money 
415312,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The rooms could do with refurbishment especially the bathroom and the rooms need a good clean we had 2 rooms for 3 nights and both rooms were grubby , Excellent location and pool and pool bar area
415313,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Drunk Brits in the lobby hot breakfast was cold rude staff security personnel slow check in generally overpriced for what it offers more 3 star than 4 star hotel, Comfortable beds and location Upstairs bar with great views
415314,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The rooms are pretty small for a 4 stars hotel There are no irons in the room and when you ask for it you can end up waiting 24h which is ridiculous for the 4 stars hotel The buffet for 10 euros could provide more food especially for those who don t eat pork The worse was the bed The blanket are so cheap and itchy and patently there are the only ones there I have been traveling my entire life and I have never seen a 4 star hotel providing those types of blanks It s the kind of Brown grayish one The mattresses we had had little bugs inside of them and we all go stung but them It s ridiculous again for a 4 stars hotel When you call the reception most of them don t know what they talking about and they say they will check and call you back and don t I was pretty disappointed by that as well , The location is great it s 5 min away from the color fountain and 10 min away from everything else you need in town including restaurants and clubs and beaches etc The rooftop is great too to relax with some friends and got great views 
415315,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, speed of service not enough personel listen to the requests of your client please bottle of water every day is minimum 1 set of toileteries shampoo etc for 4 days , rooftop pool was nice good location near Arenas and public transport bus metro 
415316,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, As residents of the hotel I thought parking should have been free or at least charged at a reduced rate , rooftop bar and pool Excellent location to travel around Barcelona 
415317,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Small gym Need more sun bathing seats on rooftops as it could get quite packed Slow service room wasn t ready at check in, Location easy access to places City view good room view
415318,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Staff at the pool bar were slow and not professional We were Completely ignored than had to wait ages for second round to be served Wine was warm served in cheap plastic glass Next day no towels left by the pool again had to ask bar staff who just said there is nothing she could do Finally after 30 min towels arrived , Location was great Very central still managed to sleep well 
415319,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, Great location esp for the Aerobus and getting around Don t be put off by the austere looking building or busy roundabout location rooms are surprisingly quiet Stunning views and great rooftop bar and pool Get to the pool 15 mins b4 opening to guarantee a sunbed though Lovely front desk staff esp Francisco We LOVED our visit 
415320,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The pool is far too small for the number of guests had to wait for courtesy towel and also hard to get a sun lounger as they were all occupied very early morning There was a constant stream of guests checking in out meaning there was a long wait at reception if we had any queries The television in the room has very little on offer , Location was perfect so close to the metro station and the Magic Fountain is 5 minute walk from the hotel Beds were very comfortable 
415321,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, low confort standards bad equipments in the room no audio system old TV interior decoration low service at the japanese restaurant, pool and chill area wifi quality
415322,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Pool area could be bigger really busy up there but not really anything to complain about, Me and my husband had a great stay here Nice staff nice room good pool area good food Overall very happy with our stay 
415323,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, very crowded Water of swimming pool wasn t clean swimming pool area too crowded I booked the hotel because it had a swimming pool but we didn t had the chance to enjoy it , location was great Very clean hotel and nice room 
415324,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, I requested a room on the upper floors on my booking Upon my arrival they said the hotel was full and they couldn t provide me with one until the next day The next day I had the pleasure to speak to the most rude cocky and unpolite recepitionist I have ever met in my life I told her I requested a room change and she said there was nothing she could do about it I told her my room did not have a mini bar and that I needed one as I often drink cold water She said she couldn t give me one I continued by saying I was very disappointed with the service to which she replied and I quote Ok Needless to say this was the worst experience I had staying at a hotel in Spain The rooms do not look like in the picture Ours was one facing the inside of the hotel and we barely got any sunlight The bed was extremely uncomfortable There was mold in the bathroom under the soap dispenser and both the tub and sink drains were almost all clogged up Terrible just terrible And for all of this they requested we payed in advance I strongly advise everyone to not visit this hotel as they do not care about their guests needs , Nothing 
415325,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The bathroom was not very modern and some parts of the bathroom and the room were a little bit damaged might be nice if the Hotel would change this , The Hotel has a really nice location 3 metros are one minute away from the Hotel The Hotel itself is also very nice and the rooftopbar and the pool are amazing 
415326,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The people at the reception seemed more interested in speaking with each other than to attend me The room was big but the bathroom was quite old looking , The location is the best
415327,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Key cards didn t work on a daily basis Had to go up and down to reception numerous times to get the cards reactivated This was annoying as it was nearly every day during our stay Reception staff are flappy always seemed a bit stressed out My card was charged incorrectly when we arrived then we were informed that more money was owed when we left due to the staff error at the beginning This all seemed a bit unclear and unprofessional and the lady at reception became quite angry when I asked her to explain what the extra charge was for Most of the staff there are polite though Room smelt of stale smoke when we arrived Asked for a double bed ended up with two singles one higher than the other Got woken up on the day of checkout at 7 15am via telephone to the room and a knock on the door Didn t have to leave until midday , Great rooftop bar views were spectacular This is the main selling point for the hotel 
415328,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Spa staff were very rude when told by reception we could use the spa for a shower on the day we left When we went to the spa the ladies working were very dismissive and arrogant Pool always too crowded not enough places to sit, Reception staff were so helpful and friendly Roof top pool was beautiful Great location bus stop and metro station right outside the hotel 
415329,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The bathroom wasn t as clean and the pool area was way too busy One could do with a few more sun beds , The pool terrace is gorgeous with an incredible view Great location close to bus stops and a shopping mall 
415330,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The gym area is small basically equipped but enough for a small work out , Upgraded room was excellent Water Fresh Fruit tray on arrival Rooms cleaned more than once a day chocolates left for us one night Safe well managed FREE safe but remember we upgraded Brilliant location well served by taxis Good places to eat round about MASSIVE bed 
415331,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Could have offered a shower room for late departures, Location was great Metro airport bus and tour buses all stop outside the hotel Roof top pool was amazing with a great view of the Fountain 
415332,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Firstly the room looks nothing like the pictures The staff of the reception are extremely impolite liars and cheats The destruction at the hotel begin with the broken door The piccolo is just like the statues of La Rambla street The room smells awful Extremely impolite waiters of the roof top bar The breakfast was very poor and every day was similar The worst thing is that the price is extremely high for that what you become , The only good thing at the hotel is the location 
415333,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Often had to queue for quite a while for front desk People putting towels down at the pool but not being there for hours , Room a great size with good aircon Brill location and good pool
415334,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, People at the reception were not well organized Although there were many people there it took really a long time for checking in Also they were not really friendly My room was not really clean I found several hairs in the toilet , Good location good facility right infront of the metroline and the shuttle from to the airport 
415335,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The staff were pleasant enough but not too friendly The woman who checked us in almost charged us 800 too much and when I pointed out that the amount she had put on the card machine was different to that she had showed me on the computer she just said that was the amount with the currency conversion which was obviously incorrect She understood in the end and amended it but didn t apologise for what could have been a massive over charge Additionally I exchanged a 100 note for some smaller notes at the reception and the guy gave me a 50 and other notes When I tried to use the 50 note later in the day to pay for the cable car I was told it was counterfeit The woman showed me and compared it to a real note and you could then see it wasn t real I returned to the reception and after 10 minutes of the woman looking for a UV light bulb she asked her manager and they did exchange it for another 50 note and apologised for the error and apparently destroyed the note The pillows on the beds were bit rubbish One of them which was a normal size had a horrible leather like cover on it which none of us could sleep on The other pillow was very small height wise so it wasn t that comfy Prices for drinks at the rooftop bar were a little pricey although I guess this can be expected due to the hotel location A little far from the beach sagrada familia las ramblas But only about 7 taxi to all of them There is a metro station right outside the hotel but we didn t use this , The rooftop pool was brilliant could be a few more sunbeds but we managed to get one each time Complimentary beach towels also good Bar staff were friendly The food looked nice but we ate out instead Clean rooms and housekeeping gave us fresh toiletries each day Mini bar was able to be used as a fridge which was also good Although one of our rooms had no mini bar at all which was a bit inconvenient Great location the magic fountains are a 5 mins walk the otherside of the roundabout Theres a large shopping centre across the road with restaurants supermarket Also lots of nice small restaurants on the surrounding roads 
415336,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The gym facilities could be improved as weights choice of machines are slightly limited , Excellent location and very friendly staff Loved the rooftop pool and bar amazing views from here during day and night 
415337,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, It takes like 30 min to order a beer in the bar at the pool Besides that everything was great, We hade the premium room whit a private terrace and jacuzzi It was really worth the money We hade the private terrace right beside the the poolarea The poolarea are excellent Good staff 
415338,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Breakfast could have been better especially considering the price paid for it , The location the view the room the pool and the staff were all just wonderful We had an excellent stay there and would thoroughly recommend this hotel to any friends of ours Enemies will be sent elsewhere
415339,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Very bad Service Meeting customer expectations and listening to what the customer wants should a priority but it is definitely not They also need to work on the quality of the rooms , location was the only acceptable thing about this hotel 
415340,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, It s a stop over place for large groups Breakfast arrangements basic but for 10 Euros not too bad , very friendly front desk close to lots of shops and metro 
415341,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The reception staff was not the attentive during check in No proper queue for check in and I also noted the couple ahead of us were wondering which counter should they go No kettle to boil water provided No bottled drinks provided It is actually basic for hotels to provide these but not here Also toiletries were not replenish daily , The location is super 
415342,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Location is not so close to main tourist attractions but metro station is 20 meters from hotel This place should be renovated Nice and clean but old furniture , Nice pool area Spacy rooms 
415343,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The gym doesn t have a weight lifting machine just free weights and cardio equipment, Excellent hotel Rooms were big breakfast was ample staff was on point the location can t be beat it has a swimming pool and I had a great deal on the room 
415344,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Basically nothing The worst thing was that the pool would need a nice warm shower but it is so not important that is just funny , The location was amazing With an amazing rooftop pool and bar overlooking plaza espa a and montjuic Even other 4 hotels did not have the same amazing view tha we had 
415345,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Could be more sunbeds around the pool area , Fantastic location excellent transport links Brilliant restaurant only had breakfast but this was fantastic 10 without booking in advance pastries fresh omelettes fresh fruit cheese and breads and good coffee Rooftop bar and pool had a brilliant view and very friendly staff 
415346,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Hotel staff was very rude i have a genius account on booking and i benefit from early checkin which i requested and they didn t even consider it Cleanliness isn t that good even room amenities is poor and the hotel pictures look much nicer than the hotel itself , location is perfect right over metro station and taxi station View from the hotel is nice 
415347,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, I must to do work hahahaha, In the beginning is should stay 3 day to do work but unfortunately my luggage was stocked en not arrived at the same time as me So I must stay longer 1 week lol I was in Barcelona with a local colleague from my company and he was at the same time my best guide He shows me restaurants etc what most of the tourists not know It was my best working week ever not know what future brings me 
415348,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The staff lacks any customer service There promptness to help assist or fix anything is sub par Our Refrigerator broke and they never came to fix it or help supplement Their spa is not relaxing as it is right by the fitness center and you can hear everything , The location was good close to the subway
415349,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Unfortunately my plane was delayed by two hour because of thunder storms so I arrived at 22 30 My Checkin was an absolute disaster the Reloje suite that I had booked and was confirmed to me via booking s reservation confirmation was given to an other client who had reserved a family suite that was give to me afterwards Since the people did not like their family room the front desk manager Lucy at reception took on her to give my room away all though confirmed to me to an other guest I had specially booked the Reloje suite because I needed to have a table for 6 for meetings since I had interviews and meetings on top of that I travel with a lot of it for work so I need space When I arrived for check in at 22 30 the receptionist Tatiana checked me in seemed trobled when asked her if there was a problem she said management had decided not to give me the suite When I insited arguing I had a confirmed suite they said air conditioning was not working then it was under construction Oh I said so if it is under constriction no one is staying in the room so I would like to see it That was impossible and refused They tried to lie there way out of it This is unacceptable Lucy did not care since she knew I had no other alternatives This caused delays agravation and a lot trouble for my meetings This is not acceptable The next day I complained to senior management and two hours later they gave me a tower suite and I did not have to pay for the first night I did appreciate the management s gesture but did not compensate for the trouble and time I lost I am still waiting for a formal excuse letter that I have not received until now I will probably never receive it I can only advice to all travellers to beware and make sure you confirme before your arrival at the hotel , The two hotel restaurants are great 
415350,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Room was on 6th floor which was just below the rooftop pool bar Was a bit noisy but couldn t really complain as had views towards Montjuic Palau Nacional Font Magica which were stunning , Great location both Espanya metro stop Aerobus airport transfers stop are just outside hotel Room was spacious had everything you needed Staff were all pleasant very helpful too 
415351,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, it s dirty I have found a pile of hairs next to the windows also some furnitures were dusty without regularly cleaning , location view from the room size of the room 
415352,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The smell of sewage on the 7th floor and in the shower Reception staff very slow and have no queuing system The road was very loud even with all the windows closed, The location was great bathrobes and slippers provided and tea coffee facilities in the room
415353,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, There was no iron in the room and despite repeatedly calling reception for one there were never any available Frustrating with creased clothes The rooftop cocktail bar has good views but is well overpriced, Great room with good views even at the rear of the hotel Location is prefect for airport transfer and magic fountain and there s a metro stop right outside for access to just about everything else Picture is the view from the rooftop pool bar
415354,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, No Iron asking for days only gave it when I made a complaint and give up a fuss Broken safe didnt give us the rooms we asked for , Location and views 
415355,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The staff were awful in reception and the service at the roof top bar is appalling they obviously do not want the customers money as they go out of their way not to serve you They had no locks for the safes in the rooms and the room had no iron the fifth floor hall stank of sewage and the towels in our room were dirty , The rooftop pool
415356,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, We arrived late due to a flight delay upon arrival they didn t have our booking even though I had my booking confirmation We had booked a really nice room but there were none available so we had to take the standard room We had to still pay the price of our original booking for the better room though Staff were apologetic and we only had to pay for one night instead of 2 as we missed a night due to the delay , Location was great for the metro breakfast was handy and good value for money The pool and rooftop facilities were great for relaxing in the afternoon and what a fantastic view Staff were friendly 
415357,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Check in was cumbersome At check in shower was not working and safety box was not available The staff attitude is not flexible and welcoming , Location is ok but not close to major streets and attractions
415358,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Bad smell on the 3rd floor No safe I think this is unacceptable Very expensive food and drinks at the pool , The amazing sky bar and its view The amazing swimming pool with lovely furniture The classic room is large as well as the bathroom 
415359,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Service level was poor No service at the pool bar had to go get drink yourself at the bar Personnel really slow and uninterested Showering in the bathtub while I asked for a shower in the booking but they didn t have this facility except in the suites which were fully booked Smelled in the hallway I got two separate beds pushed together while I selected a kingsize Door from the minibar cabinet was broken and out Breakfast area too massive not intimate at all Very uncomfortable Breakfast in room service very minimal Most of the room service services were not available between 4 8 pm so they couldn t meet my girlfriend s allergy demands I sleep in hotels almost 60 of my time and must say this was one of the worst value for money hotels I ve stayed in the past year , View was amazing Location is prime Pool and rooftop terrace was ok but too small for the size of the hotel 
415360,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The breakfast experience was terrible There were easily 120 people eating at the same time with only one omelette chef one toaster and a consistently empty pastry table Also there are no irons in the room and the few they have at the reception are constantly occupied by other guests Finally you need to be at the pool very early in the day to have any chance of a sun sofa or hammock , The location and the roof top pool and bar are the highlights We walked the whole city from the hotel and there are a lot of cabs and buses just outside the property There is also a metro stop just outside The terrace presents a great view of Mounjic fountain and castle Overall a decent stay I would stay there again 
415361,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, There is no sockets near the bed and no socket near the water boiler At the first night the hot water from the shower was very dirty brown color the second and third night the water was OK Should have more staff at the reception to help all customers and don t wait in the row, The metro station is very near The pool is very nice The view from the room is perfect Friendly staff
415362,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The furnitures are old staff only one lady and one man were helpful but other on reception were not ready to help also it is very very noisy from the street and not at all soundproof Shower has no light but not a big deal, The suite is big and has nice view from the living room
415363,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, No tea coffee making facilities in room Insufficient plugs for charging the many devices people carry these days Worn dated decor disliked rusty bath in bathroom Noisy room on busy roundabout , Roof top swimming pool and bar view from roof top bar 
415364,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, we used this hotel as a last night before leaving for airport and that worked well as there was an attached parking garage for our rental car but as a hub for exploring barcelona not a good location as a 15 20 minute cab ride from the desirable areas ,No Positive
415365,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, People being allowed to reserve sun beds and not showing up for hours , Lovely rooftop pool and bar with fantastic view Great location with metro station and airport bus stop outside 
415366,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The rooms were so old and dirty The beds had no blankets only a thin sheet so we were freezing in our sleep The fridge was broken when we arrived however they did replace it the next day for us It s a nice hotel with a great view and it s in a fantastic location But definitely not worth the money , The location was amazing really convenient Close to a lot of things 
415367,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Reception was terrible There are almost always queues and its v slow The rooms are basic and in need of decoration We were lucky enough to get an upgrade but had to move rooms during our stay , The roof terrace
415368,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, room had a penetrant smell that did not go away during my stay Pillows did not work out for me , There are 2 breakfast areas 1 is a big hall and quite noisy But right next to it there was a smaller more quit room that served better quality products A nice discovery overal a big choice for breakfast Location is good if you need to go in and out of Barcelona but still want to be near to tourist hotspots 
415369,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Nothing , Best location clean suits great view good breakfast polite stuff very beautiful square thanks front office manager Marry and reseption Linda for attention Very good Hotel Recomend

415371,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, The accommodation is brilliant We were expecting a hotel room and instead got a two bedroom two bathroom apartment with a lounge and dining room The apartment was spotless and the service offered with brilliant 
415372,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, For some reason there was no fridge in our room although there was in my daughters room The rooms at the front of the hotel were rather noisy but the views of the fountain and the museum more than compensated for that , Rooms were very comfortable views from the rooftop were amazing and the pool was very welcome at the end of a day sight seeing and walking The breakfast was delicious too We enjoyed walking to all of the places of interest from the hotel 
415373,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Bar area inside had limited atmosphere rather a corporate hotel style Resturant area not a place to relax and have a drink However the Pool Bar area was excellent for the fun loving , Convenient location for a short stay visit with good secure car parking facilities
415374,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The air conditioning could have been a little stronger and there ended up being a lot of noise in the hallway I think the noise was due to a group of teenagers staying at the hotel , The staff was exceedingly helpful and the rooms are some of the best I have experienced The pool and bar on the roof has some of the best views of Barcelona 
415375,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, Location was excellent for access to sights Aerobus metro shops and exploring nearby landmarks on foot Rooftop pool is a great place to enjoy a drink overlooking the Plaza and fountain light show at night 
415376,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, A bit bland in restaurant and front lobby lacking in atmosphere Didn t mind as rough top bar made up for it , Excellent location The roof top pool amazing as were the views over the national palace 15 mins from the airport via A2 bus and dropped off and picked up outside hotel front door Metro outside front door so easy and cheap to use 5 10 mins walk to national palace and Olympic stadium From roof top bar beautiful views of the magic fountains Hop on off bus picks up on opposite side if street Couldn t recommend enough Didn t pay for breakfast as lots of places to eat right outside hotel where we got 2 breakfasts with drinks for 10 euros Our room had brilliant view over pretty roundabout and the palace 
415377,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, rooftop pool area get after a long day of sight seeing Breakfast was wonderful lots of options View of the Palace was awesome Premiere room worth it

415379,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Bad location poor hotel for price air conditioning just did not work Generally felt uncomfortable I rarely comment but this hotel just did not deliver at all so felt compelled to review , Staff were very helpful and pleasant 
415380,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, none, The location is excellent opposite to the musical fountain The breakfast has a great variety Staff were helpful Very pleased with the location and access to all the amenities 
415381,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Loved everything , Great hotel Breakfast lovely View from pool terrace really nice and staff really helpful Right next to metro and tour buses pass next to hotel too Would love to go back 
415382,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Each time we went to reception there was a wait because they were either busy on the telephone or another client There were no leaflets or information in reception but they were provided when requested When we asked for extra bedding for the children there was no problem at all , Good location of hotel we had excellent views to the front of the hotel just a little bit of traffic noise Just 20 minute taxi ride from airport Loved the fluffy robes The maid was very thorough every day of our stay We had complimentary bath products tea and coffee and a small fridge with drinks 
415383,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, first night groups playing music until after midnight across from the hotel nothing to do with the hotel but it was noisy the third night it was a festival night so we had fireworks ALL NIGHT UNTIL 6 AM, position of hotel for our needes
415384,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Nightmare of noise all the night long Smelly bathroom Family room has no elevator you need to use stairs Value of money is not satisfying, Location View Rooftop area Parking free
415385,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Some decor and elevators were dated Not a big deal , Great location had an unbeatable view over the Plaza Great views and drinks on the rooftop poo and bar Nice attentive staff 
415386,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Not very central to las ramblas but beautiful location Payment of city tax on check out was a joke , Hotel was fabulous Clean pretty and fabulous views from the roof 
415387,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Go early to the rooftop pool When I went there were no sunbeds left or even couches , Great staff great location beautiful roof top view Loved everything about this hotel
415388,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Very slow receptionist easily distracted from what she was doing and wasted a lot of time not giving accurate information and repeating herself instead of getting on with the job Rooms not available at designated check in time but receptionist tried to defend it rather than sorting it out Rather busy with groups Room in need of some maintenance, Good facilities but stretched by number of guests Japanese restaurant on site very good Great location over looking the Placa de Espana and next to the old bull ring now a shopping and entertainment centre 
415389,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Overall very noisy atmosphere and bad acoustics entrance hall breakfast hall room interior bit run down , upon request staff kindly organised a chair for me so I could actually work on the desk The one in the room is not suited for that 
415390,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, bar by pool was not very efficient not a major issue just irritating, beautiful roof top pool and bar great view from our room on 12th floor Clean and modern excellent location 
415391,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The bar staff at the pool area were appalling to slow disappeared when a queue appeared then come back and serve someone else If you could get a drink walked away two or three times Also some were not allowed to use till could serve you but couldnot take money BIZZARE Bathroom was poor mould around bath top Some of the finish in hotel was poor It needs a bit of refurbishment, The breakfast was very good Swimming pool area lovely but too crowded Hotel in a brilliant area for exploring could nearly walk to all site seeing areas 
415392,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, The rooftop pool had the most fantastic setting with views over Plaza Espana and the truly beautiful Museum of Art across the way Having a poolside sangria with those exceptional views made our little mini break We re quite into walking so nothing was more than 30 mins away from the hotel The hotel was perfectly located for the metro and the airport bus the stops were outside the hotel The room was lovely and the hotel staff were fantastic 
415393,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Didn t like the pool people were saving seats and they weren t even there The lady staff member behind the bar at the pool was rude Breakfast staff weren t very friendly I asked to be shown how to use the toaster and the girl was rude Location good but not that close to shops , The bed was comfy We liked the fruit platter and water on arrival and that when ever we left our room was made up 
415394,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Overall the staff was good but a few of the front desk concierge personnel were not helpful The bar staff was fun and friendly , The location was excellent as were the amenities 
415395,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Asked for early check in arrived at 11 30 but did not get Asked for highest floor available for the room but got floor 3 out of 6 Asked for late check out but did not get Room service selection poor and food not very nice Asked for ice for room was charged three euros as a frequent traveller I do not know the last time I paid for ice Asked for iron ironing board as not in room received iron after 45 minutes ironing board at least another 25 minutes later when I questioned they share out the stock so you have to wait until free Pool bar service very slow staff would complete jobs like cutting slices of orange before serving you your drinks even if this takes 5 10 minutes Air con in room was barely working Maid would knock and open door when no sign was out to say clean room, Location Roof pool and bar
415396,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, I had room 644 that had a telephone that did not work very well and appeared damaged Also workmen in next room began their work from 08 00 in the morning which made a nice and quiet lay in impossible So had no choice but to get up and get out I am not a complaining type of man but someone should really have done something about this as opposed the let s see if they make a fuss attitude No one told me or warned me about this refurbishment next door or even offered an upgrade which would have been nice The prices for food and drinks are way overboard Tried dialling room service to get two pizzas number 2 on dodgy phone It rang then someone kept lifting the receiver and plonking it down This happened about 4 times so I called reception And miraculously I got room service Up at the pool there are clear signs of no dive bombing shouting and screaming and splashing Yet one afternoon a group of kids were doing this soaking our phones and I pads None of the staff were bothered to do anything about it for some strange reason Apart from that It was fine , The room was really what did it for me at first Due to the huge bed the views Showers and bathroom excellent Staff are also very nice and very helpful when approached 
415397,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Drinks were quite expensive but probably about normal for hotels in Barcelona Pool and gym were a little small , Excellent location Premium rooms are spacious and well equipped Excellent access to Metro system Superb views of Montju c 
415398,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, Great location within walking distance of Sants station so perfect for an overnight stop en route to Paris by train Complimentary upgrade to a suite and easy to use coffee machine Amazing view 
415399,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, We are four frequent travellers and are not overly fussy but were dissatisfied with reception and dining areas staff on several occasions during a 2 day stay which left all of us with a negative impression of an otherwise very nice hotel , Great location for monuments tourist bus metro station and eateries Breakfast cost was separate and very good value Comfortable large bed Rooftop pool area 
415400,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, We were a group of friends all experienced travellers and at the end of our stay we all agreed that the staff at this hotel was perhaps the rudest slowest and generally most hostile we have ever encountered The hotel itself and its facilities are good but stay away if you plan on spending time on the rooftop or using any of the facilities at the hotel gym restaurants etc With the exeption of one nice young lady in the caf on the ground floor the staff including and in particular the service personell in the bars and restaurants reacted to every simple request with hostility as if we kept interrupting other important tasks like coffee sipping playing with smartphones and exchanging gossip In addition to being hostile they were extremely slow hard to communicate with in other languages than Spanish and everything seemed impossible for instance ordering drinks and food at the same time Please note that this is definitely not a question of culture or representative of Barcelona We regularly travel to Barcelona and we have in the past encountered wonderful and service minded staff in other hotels In the end we were genuinly shocked by the behaviour of the staff The negative atmosphere was a real moodkiller and we could not help thinking about how wasteful it is to keep such miserable employees when there are so many others out there that are in need of work and ready to give good service It really is a shame , The hotel is safe clean and has a wonderful rooftop in terms of facilities space view and deco 
415401,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, First room we were given fixtures and fittings were in a poor state the floor in the bathroom was dirty and the view out overlooked a run down tower block the shower head fell off when tried using it they did give us another room which had a better fixtures and fittings , Staff dealt with our issue quickly
415402,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The only bad thing I could say about the place is that the drinks at the pool were quite expensive but we didn t really drink alcohol so I wasn t overly bothered The location was a strange one perfect location for the magic fountain etc but then I felt there weren t as many restaurants without getting a taxi somewhere , Read a few reviews saying that this hotel wasn t as good as advertised so I was very pleased when we arrived to find it exceeded my expectations The hotel and rooms were extremely clean staff friendly and helpful Our room had an incredible view and the beds were very comfy The bar pool area is amazing furnished luxiouriously with beautiful bed loungers Also an incredible view of the magic fountain from up here The airport bus is also right outside the hote and gets to the airport in about 20 minutes for under 6 so we would recommend doing this 
415403,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, Fantastic location for exploring all areas of the city just jump on the metro Great facilities at the hotel i e roof top pool Rooms were clean and tidy and well sized Staff were very welcoming Friendly throughout our stay 
415404,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, I left my luggage there in the morning and they seemed to have real trouble finding it when I came back to check in, Tremendous location with a metro entrance just a few feet from the front door despite the expense the room was incredible I don t think they charged me even though I told them I was stealing a robe
415405,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, G T s were great but thought a little pricey at 15, Great roof top pool area perfect for relaxing after a long day sightseeing Fabulous G T s too 
415406,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Nothing really The hotel does get very busy at morning evening check in or out so you do need to be patient and firm , The location is excellent very easy to get into town Hotel is clean and efficient and IMHO worth what we paid to stay there 
415407,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Sleep quality I specifically asked for a double room only to find my partner and I had been allocated a twin I presume this is because we were arriving late 11pm They did change our room the next day I was awoken by cleaners on two out of four mornings who were very noisy One lady was banging the bed against the wall in the next room which woke me up quite abruptly I asked her to please make less noise and she was a bit rude I understand she has a job to do but I am also paying to have a good night s sleep or morning lay in for that matter , Excellent location Rooftop pool really lovely Reception staff very helpful Sushi served at poolside bar delicious Gym perfectly adequate for quick workout Lovely hotel and would go back 
415408,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, maintenance of the rooms could be better, Room was perfect with a great view Roof top terasse with pool is great Breakfast is rich and tasty Wifi works good
415409,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, I found it frustrating you had to go from the pool down the lifts to the reception walk around to the lobby lifts to go back up to the rooms , Awesome location and Pool was fantastic Breakfast was also great 
415410,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The rooftop pool was the total standout The rest was very nice but I would give it a higher rating primarily because of the pool, Loved the rooftop pool and the party on the rooftop on Sunday particularly during the day while at the pool Liked the regularity of cleaning and turndown and liked the towels and facilities at the pool
415411,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The pool was not heated so too cold to swim Cooked breakfast was somewhat limited , Comfortable bed in a clean spacious room with a view Staff very friendly and hotel is in an excellent location 
415412,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Quite old fashioned Needs updating I got pick pocketed right outside the hotel so not to keen on location Not very easy to get hold of an iron Staff could barely speak English Not worth the price at all ,No Positive
415413,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, Location was excellent there is a metro station literally right outside the hotel The room was very spacious and clean The bed was very comfy We had breakfast one morning and it was very good excellent variety of foods View from the roof terrace is amazing 
415414,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, the fact that I rented a double room two people but there is only one chair in the room to sit on An ice machine on every floor is required, good bed cleanliness and excellent location
415415,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Noisy as traffic going 24hrs but get used to it and not too bad a problem One morning when we wanted a lie in got woken early with music guess got wrong room for an early wake up call Roof area a bit tricky to but worth it Nothing much really , Good size room with nice decor location fantastic and public transport right outside and so easy to find Breakfast lovely and can have it between 7 30 and 10 30am which is great Roof top pool and bar area fab with amazing views Would stay again for definite 
415416,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Hotel reception very busier all the time , Amazing location everywhere near beautiful views very nice roof terrace with a swimming pool Very nice breakfast choice of food 
415417,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, the fact that we did not have any tea or coffee making facilities in the room we did ask but was told none was available considering the price we paid for our stay we felt this was a bit of a let down for such a grand hotel , very relaxing holiday lots of enjoyable moments spent on the roof top terrace weather was very good hotel was very good staff very helpful close to all local amenities plenty of local bars and restaurants to choose from 
415418,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Did not like your hotel Lower than international standards please read comment above in what did you like, I landed after midnight No room service between midnight and 7am Pathetic Could not get food at night or a cup of tea at 6am when i wake up How on earth did you manage to get 4 stars 
415419,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Room service was a Telepizza brochure where the food even looked revolting This in Barcelona where the food is unbelievably good A total mismatch as the hotel and room was otherwise really nice , Very nice hotel with good price spacious rooms friendly staff good breakfast 
415420,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, room a little shabby around the edges got a twin room instead of double but didnt change as didnt want to lose the view we had drinks at the rooftop bar were crazy expensive , Rooftop pool unbelievable view from room
415421,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The spa is always closed and no one was available to even take an appointment , Everything was amazing especially the location the view from hotel to the Mont Juic and Magic Fountain and it s facing the Metro station Plaza Espana
415422,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Drink prices at the roof top pool bar are a tad overpriced , Amazing Hotel Rooftop pool Amazing views of the city Very Central hotel close to everything Bus stop metro right outside the hotel Love Barcelona and will be back to stay at this very hotel very soon xxxx
415423,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, We complained on the first of our 5 day trip that the shower wasn t working properly nothing was done about this, Location was great minutes from the metro station which takes you into the touristy parts of Barcelona It was clean and the rooftop is amazing 
415424,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, We had a junior suite it was excellent very quiet clean and bed was excellent Location was perfect as Coldplay venue only 15 min walk Metro station just outside and airport bus stop also just outside
415425,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The air conditioning could have been a lot stronger The rooftop was booked out for events for a few of the days so a pre warning would have been preferred , The breakfast buffet was only 10 Euro per person when we arrived So we added that on immediately The rooftop bar and pool were exceptional as well as the restaurants The proximity of the hotel to well known Arena s for events was very good so I recommend you book up a Music event for one of the days you stay 
415426,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Would have been really great to get a late check out but sadly they weren t able to let me have more than 30 mins so with a little sight seeing in the morning there was very little time to enjoy the terrace before moving out Pricey too but I think overall I was happy to pay it to be sure of a nice place to stay , Great room with a wonderful view of Plaza Espanya Roof top terrace was fantastic but get there early if you want a comfy seat 
415427,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Swimming pool was closed for the afternoon for a private party not good when you have paid 184 euros because of the facilities Furniture in the room was stained and tired Shower rose settings were broken and the tap hot and cold indicator was missing , Breakfast was kept topped up everything nice and fesh
415428,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Check in was to late even though we requested a early check In as we arrived at the hotel at 10 00am I understand the hotel was full the night before but I don t believe that no guests checked out early the next morning, Room was comfortable staff at reception were really nice The girl at reception realised it was my birthday that day and organised a complimentary bottle of Cava to the room Reaaly nice touch Wonderful rooftop terrace wth pool and bar 
415429,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The pool area tables and decking littered with plastic cups used towels and other various plastic wrappers Staff should have been clearing up more frequently to prevent this shabby look , The friendliness polite and helpful staff Location of the hotel Well connected and choice of public transport services with bus stops taxi ranks and underground station next to it 
415430,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Room was a little tatty Mould in bathroom sink Chairs in foyer dirty Ignored twice at reception Daughter cut her leg and no first aid kit Room noisy could hear everyone in corridor and next door, Location pool area breakfast area
415431,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Was disappointed that most of the pool area was closed on our first day for a private function and on our second day it closed again at 4pm for another private function Which is annoying when we have booked the hotel because of the lovely looking pool , The hotel was immaculate everywhere looked brand new It was on a busy roundabout but you could hear a pin drop in the bedrooms The view from the rooftop pool was incredible Tourist bus was right outside Wasn t in the best location but a cab to La Ramblas was under 10E and there was a metro station nearby Breakfast was delicious 
415432,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Not much in the surrounding area except for the MNAC A bit of a walk to Ramblas , Good location convenient for Sants rail station airport bus and tour buses
415433,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Front desk staff should be manned with more representatives sometimes the wait was extraordinarily long staff can smile more often toilets and towels had a funny smell that needs to be looked into if you have a room with a view inside the hotel facing the breakfast garden place terrible view then , Breakfast was good omelettes especially Excellent location if you want a variety of restaurants shops and tourist attractions nearby Hotel is right in the center of the city center WiFi is great 
415434,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Sent my parents for a birthday present deliberately paid a large amount for a suite as they rarely get time away together Would have been nice to have been able to check into the room at 2pm they got there at 11 30am rather than 6pm with the excuse of someone is still in the room even though they were emailed weeks beforehand to say the trip was a special occasion and the time they would arrive The staff could have been more helpful when offering free breakfast as a result of this then changing their mind and sending my parents up and down different floors to different staff members who couldn t agree on a decision , The hotel was beautiful and the views were fantastic 
415435,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Drinks prices at rooftop bar But the view makes up for that a lot, Location excellent Staff helpful Rooms clean and well designed and presented Can t think of a better place to stay in the city
415436,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, FOUR GIN AND TONICS 58 00 EUROS I DIDNT LIKE THAT MUCH THATS ALL THO, LOCATION PERFECT METRO DIRECTLY OUTSIDE BREKKA LITTLE EXPENSIVE BUT IT WAS WORTH IT
415437,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The only terrible moment in that hotel was the moment I left , The views from the pool and its large terrasse are breath taking the athmosphere there extremely lively and animated by charming personel Pretty cool 
415438,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Can t fault anything about this hotel, Great location fantastic view of the city from the pool area on level eight Shopping centre straight opposite hotel as is all transport links 
415439,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Hot food items on buffet breakfast were mainly cold but staff did get freshly cooked hot items after I mentioned it to them Beds pillows and chairs in bedroom could have been more comfortable Quite expensive B B rate, Lovely view from bedroom Good selection at breakfast Friendly helpful staff Beautiful rooftop terrace with pool loungers and bar with stunning views 
415440,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Commissionair consierge who stands by the entrance doors could have been a little more pleasant and welcoming even a smile would be good , Rooms very clean and comfortable
415441,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, There were less negatives than positives but it got pretty noisy since our room was right by the elevators There were children that woke up early to play right by our door Also room service wasn t so strong we asked for an iron and never received it , The staff was very friendly and welcoming The location of the hotel was excellent and the area felt safe Easy access for transportation and the shopping mall across the street was a plus The view from the room was definitely a beautiful one as well 
415442,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The one thing we were disappointed by was when we booked a room we asked for early check in and late check out the answer was yes if it is possible at that time Not surprisingly the hotel hasn t provided that as all rooms have been already booked but when we asked for late check out for extra money they continued our reservation for the room without any doubt and asked the payment for the whole day VAT at once , liked the hotel a lot An amazing place to stay if you ve got a car parking is free and is situated in the hotel Verrryy comfortable if you take a room with a view pretty sure you ll fall in love with it as we did Moreover swimming pool and the bar on the roof top is an amazing place to spend your time The breakfast is tasty Overall the hotel is the top one
415443,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Reception staff were generally disinterested on check in and out Room was too small for family of four to share We paid extra for hotel with pool but when we went to use it at 4pm it was shut for private party later that day When I asked why we hadn t been informed the receptionists response was that he hadn t been told either So two very disappointed children and an unnecessary expense the rest of the weekend was raining though obvs not hotel s fault Not good enough for a hotel that charges this much to rely on location alone , Location was excellent sitting above the underground entrance exit and next to cafe for breakfast
415444,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Stains on the floor in the room Corridors need carpets because all the sounds resonate and it can get loud even from the smallest noise Can t think of anything else , Great view from the room and most importantly great roof top bar and pool Staff friendly and helpful Receptionists also speak English and Russian Comfy bed Couple of restaurants with nice food right in the hotel 
415445,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The Japanese restaurant had little selection and every item ordered was wrong , Had a suite on 11th floor Views were amazing Staff was friendly and helpful 
415446,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, As many people have said before the hotel was incredibly overpriced for the amount of money paid We were in one of the cheap rooms The quality was terrible broken lamp fittings and chair dirty windows and a grubby stain on the wall where a picture once hung We were so unimpressed we had to ask to be moved after the first night I thought the hotel may upgrade us as we were so discruntled but we were put into a similar room I certainly think you can find much better bang for your buck in BCN It s worth shopping around ,No Positive
415447,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Staff weren t helpful or attentive Check in was long No tea or coffe facilities Ignored by staff in cafe area Wifi didn t work Beds uncomfortable and room tiny 3 sangrias cost 37 50 , The location was excellent and we had a city view which was the only plus point
415448,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, I traveled with my 2 year old The room was very child friendly apart from the window which I couldn t leave open as it was easily accessible for my son to climb up to , The breakfast was fantastic value for money omelettes cooked to order in front of you Check in and check out was quick and easy Stunning roof terrace The complementary water and fruit platter as well as the welcome drinks were a lovely touch of luxury that matched the hotel Spent a lot of time in the hotel due to the weather and didn t mind Will definitely return and stay in a room on the front 
415449,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Absolutely nothing except that there s not enough staff at the spa area to take your order and they close as early as 9 pm , Location is more than excellent very elegant plaza Espa a area near to EVERYTHING Hotel has it all spa massage amazing buffet breakfast big rooms that has view to Mount Ju c and Magic fountain facing arena shooing mall near las Ramblas plaza Catalunya the beach Amazing staff rooftop swimming pool There s nothing that I didn t like about it Even the shower

415451,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, I placed my digital camera with 200 zoom lens on the receptions counter as I was arriving in main lobby It was taken as I spoke to staff and the manager staff said without hesitating that their insurance would not cover it Filed report with police and nothing happened Stay away from this hotel ,No Positive
415452,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, A twin room was changed into a triple room by adding an extra bed for an adult person This made the room really packed and it was impossible for us to move between one of the beds and the wardrobe As a consequence we didn t use the wardrobe , I really liked the location very convenient 
415453,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Why is the safe deposit box on floor in dark cabinet Cannot see the numbers and have to lie down on the floor to use it Bit noisy in the corridors because of the thin parkett and loud door locks , good location next to AirBus stop and Fair 
415454,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The pool should be heated and bar staff need a bit of training Toothpaste provided for one use only Same with complementary water fruit We stayed for a week , Roof terrace is excellent 
415455,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, I just thought it wasn t that nice inside for what it costs Laminated floors don t really do it for me Dont get me wrong the hotel os ok but nothing special Probably better for larger groups , great location easy transport links

415458,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, 1 The hotel is very noisy inside with banging doors and loud staff activity 2 Bathroom not clean and poor 3 Reception area very slow with long queues even for simple questions 4 Need to queue for coffee at breakfast in a 4 star hotel , very little
415459,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, the standard rooms offered look like in a hostel the state of the room was really poor chipped off furniture and doors fungus all over the bathroom even the entrance door did not close propperly and made loud noise with a draft from other doors and windows For a 120 Euro a night we didnt want to stay in a hostel room We were shown the same rooms again when we asked for a new one Then we realized that all pictures shown to potential guests on the net are the ones in the renovated part of the hotel Going up the elevator that also leads up to the incredible rooftop are the better rooms We paid little more per night about 20 Euro and then had a really nice accomodation A shame that they dont renovate all rooms All 8 5 reviews here can only be from people staying in the renovated area of this hotel At the moment it is a 4 Star hotel with 2 star and 4 star rooms A shame they try to still sell the unrenovated rooms to guest They should renovate even if the price per night is a little higher , the roof top with its pool is AMAZING the views stunning 
415460,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Breakfast Even after asking no orange juice or egg for 15 minutes Cigarette smell on the floor hotel personnel couldn t smell it playing stupid , Location location location
415461,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The room was very load bed is awfully hard The hotel is very big and feels quite impersonal It was not easy to find the way to the upper levels bar fitness , The Metro is directly in front of the hotel entrance The bar at the top with swimming pool is really amazing awesome view Also if you take more expensive rooms with city view the view is great Fantastic idea to split the breakfast in a lively one and also a quiet and nice business breakfast room 
415462,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Nothing , Had an absolutely incredible stay at Catalonia Barcelona Plaza this past week I have been traveling around Europe for the past month and this was by far the best hotel I stayed at They also upgraded me to a suite which was lovely Incredible rooftop area and great overall location Staff had great customer service breakfast was great and plentiful Would recommend to everyone

415466,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Nothing , I arrived with my partner for our anniversary and the hotel arranged an upgrade to a suite champagne chocolates and for the entirety of our stay the staff offered 5 star service and hospitality in a 4 star hotel The staff are excellent attentive and go beyond requirements particularly Mariana and the front desk staff Perfect location for the airport and the city centre excellent amenities room decor and facilities the rooftop bar swimming pool in particular I could not recommend this hotel more highly 
415467,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, It was a very awful experience the entrance of the hotel were very dirty cigarettes every where the reception lady were nice in the beginning and after that she offered me to have an upgrade to stay in a higher floor with slippers and tea cattle with a 10 euros a day and refused to take it and she became suddenly rude and she told me the check in is at 2 30 pm and it was 1 30 so I went for a walk and I came later and the same lady gave me the top floor with tea cattle 2 slippers Regarding the room I pray for the poor cleaners because they do very hard job to clean an over used room The room Smells bad that I had to open the window for the whole night the sink was over flood the shower was 2 star shower from the 70 s So I barley managed to stay one night and cancelled the rest of my stay with a extra fees and ran away to another hotel If look for aquit hotel this is not it because big tours are staying in At the end It feels 2 5 star hotel , The only good thing about the hotel is the location it s near two famous place unless you are looking for night life it s not the right place

415498,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, For an upmarket hotel like this I would have expected gowns and slippers not a necessity I know but something nice to have available The airconditioning system felt too warm and we had to sleep with the window open on 5th floor which was quite noisy Have seen on previous reviews on Trip Advisor similar issues wrt aircon , Lovely hotel in an excellent location Friendly and helpful staff clean and upmarket hotel and definitely a place we would return to Nice surprise were some complimentary macaroons and water Also pastries and coffee outside lift lobby on our floor

415509,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, I specifically requested a room with a view of the fountain and plaza espana to see the New Years event from my room because of my impairment and was told my accommodation would be met I arrived and was placed on the 7th floor which would have had a great view if it weren t for the metal grates covering every window on that floor I asked for a room change and was told I could downgrade to a smaller room on the 6th floor and to await a call from reception so I could see the room first The follow up never happened So I stayed with my room out of spite as I was tired of being the unhappy complaining guest So I went to the terrace on the 8th floor for the celebration Two staff members told me early in the day the doors for the terrace open at 11pm and if I came early I would be sure to have a seat due to my physical impairment when I arrive at 1040 there was at least 150 people on the terrace and hardly room to stand A manager scrambled to find one seat crammed into a corner after I hobbled downstairs to raise an another issue But no seat for my Mrs It was barely a pleasant experience as I had arranged things at this hotel for the sole purpose of viewing the New Year s Eve celebration My requests were half heartedly met or not met at all with only a fair effort from the staff who seemed to have their decision making authority stripped from them , The location was great I was recovering from a foot surgery so it was nice to be close to the New Years celebration at the fountain Cabs are super reasonable all over the city anyway The hotel was clean and comfortable but the price was slightly over reaching the value of the stay 
415510,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, Excellent location near Sants Montjuic Close to metro bus connections Olympic Venues Camp Nou Great room beautiful view from rooftop pool area is great Staff most helpful especially Sandra at front desk 
415511,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Nothing poor reception staff once I reached back Swiss the hotel charged my cc which was given while making the booking com while checking out i cleared all the charges and still my card being charged when I called the hotel after arriving in Switzerland the receptionist asked to provide the proof of the charges like im a thief why cant hotel check in the system whether card is charged or not Still no refund yet , Nothing poor reception staff once I reached back Swiss the hotel charged my cc which was given while making the booking com while checking out i cleared all the charges and still my card being charged when I called the hotel after arriving in Switzerland the receptionist asked to provide the proof of the charges like im a thief why cant hotel check in the system whether card is charged or not Still no refund yet 
415512,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The dining area for breakfast was cold and the food was nothing special I think the laminate flooring in the corridors was a mistake if you consider the potential for noise when the hotel is fully occupied , The location is perfect for tourist attractions Entrance to the metro is right outside the front door and the airport bus also stops there The rooftop area is attractive and my room overlooked Plaza Espana 
415513,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, That we couldn t stay longer, Room was clean tidy great view of Barcelona city centre close to shops bars and places to eat sightsee and bus to and from the airport stopped outside Great
415514,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, bathrooms no clean hotel is old no positiev attutude towards proactive customer service no room service no kettle shower drain in the suite was blocked complained twice nothing done, the view 
415515,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, We stayed at Catalonia Barcelona Plaza for 4 nights two of those nights were miserable because of clogged up sink and shower which was never resolved also the entire luxury bathroom in room 803 smelled like a ditch We were not able to move to an equivalent room because nothing was available On the third day we tried the clock room with picture windows which did not open no bathtub and smelled like cigarette smoke Tried room 902 had corner view windows upon opening two windows unbelievable amount of dusts blew all over the place Pick your poison We were told that the spa facility was closed on New Years Day because the contract people were off , One of the managers did her best to make our stay better After our complaints about the stench in the room we were compensated for two nights We eventually got what we booked for which was a clean room firm mattress and a bathroom with a shower and tub The Nespresso in the room was great and we really liked the Japanese Restaurant at the hotel From the hotel there is a decent view of the Magic Font about 1 2 kilometer away but one of the Venetian Tower blocks the center view The perfect view is from the center of the Placa d Espanya but that circle is completely blocked on New Years Eve 
415516,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Room service The rooms were not cleaned well Bed linen very dirty Some staff rude, The evening reception staff and morning staff were great and very helpful Can t remember names but they were great Room service was terrible and cleanliness of the room was not great 
415517,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, the pressure the the shower is not enough so that the water is really small, The room is nice and big the staff was helpful and the room is also really clean The wifi is stable 
415518,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, our room was too hot the hotel switched into winter schedule and turned off the air conditioner That s the answer I got after complaining about the room temperature They told me to open the window , location was outstanding and staff personnel were top of line 
415519,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Water pressure in the shower was low there was mold on the bathroom s ceiling felt like there should be more means of security at the front door, location comfortable beds could open the window nice staff clean room beautiful view from the roof
415520,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, No bad experiences at all, Everything The Hotel is in an excellent location and travel to anywhere in the City is easy We were upgraded to a suite on arrival which was excellent Staff are all first class and nothing was too much trouble for them
415521,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The room service menu could have been better You could choose either the Japanese or a pizza place outside of the hotel that bring food , We had a suite and it was even bigger and nicer than expected One of the nicest rooms i ve ever stayed in The staff were very friendly and helpful they bought anything we needed iron plug adapters etc The Japanese restaurant in the hotel was really nice The rooftop terrace had great views 
415522,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, the noise of the flashing the toilet is very loud like airplane s you can hear neighbour s as well you can hear the heavy step from above room, The view from my room breakfast room atmosphere lobby with piano play even she he is not very good player cleanness of the room
415523,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, Staff great view room location location location Airport shattle station in few meters Plenty restaurants around from posh to regular ones Arenas shopping center in 50 meters 
415524,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, we asked if we could do breakfast on terrace on sunday 1 11 15 but was told it was not enough notice we was disappointed as it was my wifes 50th birthday so i wanted to surprise her , central for most areas lively plenty of places to eat and drink value for money terrace area was great with swimming pool and bar area view was amazing
415525,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Not much Just window view from room 518 I think that s my room I felt breakfast should have been included in stay , Front desk staff where excellent Loved the roof top bar and pool Great location Thanks
415526,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, This is my second visit and yet again it is impossible to get through to reception in the evening it s constantly engaged , The friendliness of the staff the location a very comfortable bed and room
415527,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, We only stayed here for one night but an excellent location right in the city centre friendly staff and luxurious rooms I really like the welcome macrons on arrival and the separate enormous shower The bed was really comfortable and overall It was excellent value for money I d like to come back and stay for longer 
415528,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The pool was outside and practically unusable The gym was small and not very well equiped , The room was very nice and had a magnificent view over beatiful parts of Barcelona We also got an upgraded room for free at our arrival 
415529,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The first room I was put in absolutely stank of smoke the second room was already occupied the third room was ok but the fridge was broken The beds were uncomfortable the decor was tired and old I will not be staying here again , The pool area had been refurbished and was good
415530,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Wonderful experience nothing I did not like , The hotel is located within walking distance of the Olympic buildings and parks the Poble Espanyol museums the Magic Fountains and many restaurants The Airport bus picks up right in front of the hotel The hotel staff was very helpful in answering questions and making suggestions The hotel is very clean 
415531,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, NOTHING, I couldnt believe that such wonderful hotel is so unexpensive It is very fancy and huge 24 hours english speaking receptionists at least 3 at all times They help alot and treat you very kindly The hotel location is excellent 10 minutes to the camp nou by taxi will cost 6 to 7 euros only The area is lively and nice I will definayely stay there again 
415532,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Could have done with a pool in the spa area and spa staff not as helpful as hotel staff, Really helpful staff helped with every need Got free upgrade as was our anniversary
415533,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Asked for extra bed as we booked a triple room got no linen at all for this bed just a matress for firsy two days finally wrote a note for the chambermaid and got linen , Very pleasant staff always helpful 
415534,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, No kettle in the room and room service was very slow , We loved the pool but we weren t happy about the fact we couldn t have breakfast on the terrace or a drink at the bar as it was closed 
415535,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The only issue I had was at check in on day of arrival I paid for the accommodation by credit card and I had the choice of settling the bill in either GBP sterling or Euros I settled in GBP sterling however in hindsight I should have settled by Euro as the cost was much more by sterling The choice of payment was not fully explained to me by the reception staff and clients should be made aware of this when paying for accommodation when visiting a European destination , The location of the hotel was ideal for getting around Barcelona There was a metro subway outside the hotel Only a few metres to the Aerobus stop to get to the airport Fantastic view of Plazad Espanya and Montjuic from our hotel bedroom 
415536,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, we had the AC control box broken when we came in and although asking for it has not been fixed for 2 days probably will be left broken for long time , breakfast location and parking
415537,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, We felt that the room itself was a little dated and not as big as we were expecting We were a little disappointed with service we called to ask for a wine bottle opener an iron and an ironing board and all we got was the iron itself as the other things were not available Generally we thought that the hotel was a little overpriced for such a small room but the location and views made up for it , The location of the hotel and views from the room were great The bed was very large and comfortable and the room was lovely and quiet and dark so perfect for sleeping The rooftop pool and bar had wonderful views as well as a great cocktail list The Japanese restaurant was lovely for dinner and the breakfast choices were very good 
415538,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, No iron in room and when I requested one got an iron but no ironing board Long queues at reception at some points Gym very basic, great location comfortable rooms and helpful staff
415539,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Reception should have a separate location for the concierge and perhaps even information as the reception staff were always busy and sometimes you had to wait , the staff were very nice and helpful although the check in was not till two oclcok and then i had to queue up again which was a little annoying
415540,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The staff were extremely rude and unhelpful We were checking in at 1am We specifically requested twin beds not only at the time of booking but also at the time of check in We were given a double bed When I explained that a double was not what was booked they more or less shrugged their shoulders I paid 190 for one room for one night This was very disappointing behavior and service , Location is good 
415541,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Nothing bad but room service was limited to the menus of two local takeaways pizza and sushi , We got upgraded to a suite which included a surprise free bottle of cava 
415542,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, We were on a tour and stayed for two nights The toilet was leaking and water was coming in through the ceiling in the passage near the bathroom We reported this to reception The problems were immediately attended to , Excellent location Spacious dining room and bedroom Staff friendly and helpful 
415543,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Issue with the shower drainage the water drains very slow , Walking distance to the attractions Staff are very attentive and provide good customer service 
415544,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Our room was a bit run down stains and mold on the bathroom ceiling With that said it was a good room over all, Pool area is great Hotel is nice over all
415545,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The hotel is old fashioned Some rooms And areas are reformed but not all, Location Ideal if you are going to an event At Palau Sant Jordi or Olympic stadium
415546,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, I can t think of anything that I didn t like It was perfect , I ve traveled quite a bit in my life and this hotel experience ranks at the top of my list of hotels I ve visited From the room the views location staff everything was top notch 
415547,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The clerks at the frontdesk reception when we arrived late in the day made a number of mistakes that were inexcusable , An employee named Tenzin who was the Manager of the frontdesk reception did an exceptionally good job for us Without her help our visit would have been a bummer 
415548,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, My room had been recently renovated I have not traveled much in my lifetime but this was hands down the most luxurious room I have ever booked This was room 422 behind the large clock on building front The view was amazing 
415549,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, All good , We are sometimes a little uncomfortable in a luxury hotel but here the staff was welcoming and helpful We picked it because of its location for the La Merc closing festivities It delivered 
415550,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, our only negative was with the pool we would have liked to have a swim earlier later than the opening hours Also some mornings there would be businessmen carrying on loud conference calls up there not very relaxing, the view from our room was excellent and the hotel location perfect for us with superb transport links to explore all areas of Barcelona
415551,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, We were fortunate enough to receive an upgrade to a suite which was an unexpected surprize which had spectacular views over the city and roof pool The location is exceptional for exploring Barcelona s central southern neighbourhoods and only 20 30 minute stroll to Ramblas Great for transport being right on Plaza Espana Reception staff were friendly and helpful even though they were busy when we arrived 
415552,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Air Conditioning did not work even after a visit from staff the shower directed the water at the ceiling rather than downwards had obviously been doing this for some time as the ceiling was damaged when reported to reception staff this was met with an uncommitted response and no apology , The roof top terrace bar
415553,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The location was not be best The Restaurante looked like a canteen It was too big and not cozy at all, It was spacious The swimming pool at the terrace was spectacular Very good ambience for young people
415554,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, To enhance more the spa with jaccuzzi, Amazing hotel great service very friendly and efficient staff High end hotel that really cares about its clients Love it
415555,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Traveling with elders checked out the night before Paid for breakfast in euros and was still charged on credit card I will dispute this charge with my cc , The cleanliness the housekeeping service was excellent Christain on the pool bar excellent made sure our glasses were always full ran down to the restaurant after food was not avail at the pool and brought us some sandwiches Rafael at the pool bar recommended sights to see that were not on any of the sights to see in Barcelona Excellent Service by these two young men
415556,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, Good position with bus services and underground outside Hotel Away from the hustle and bustle down town Great rooftop bar with good views Will use again 
415557,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Told had two free drink credits for rooftop pool area but after drinking our drinks and checking out of rooftop pool told only for cava and not for all drinks Thank would not assign to room for payment , Excellent location Front desk attendant assisted with bags to room when butler temporarily gone Air conditioner actually noitcibaly cooled contrasted to other similar quality hotels on our Excellent view from 641
415558,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, could have slightly better sound isolation from hallway but was pretty good overall , large quiet clean room good wifi elevator comes fast food options downstairs good view
415559,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The staff with the exception of Reception were not particularly friendly Sorry but, We got a free upgrade with a great view and room was spacious We didn t book breakfast but got a discounted rate for breakfast during our stay where the choice was good for 10 euros per person The area was great and metro and bus stops were very handy 
415560,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, Pool was not very big but very nice in lounche style environment Rooms very spacious and we were lucky to have a great view on the fountains Very friendly and helpful staff
415561,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, The location The hotel is located right in front of the metro the tour bus stop and the National museum of art Also it s right beside the Arenas which is where bullfighting used to take place but now it s a 5 story mall with tons of stores and restaurants Everywhere we went was just a few stops on the metro or within 10 minutes by taxi 
415562,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, the breakfast was disappointing It felt like we were in a high school canteen The food was below average and the staff could not keep up with demand The coffee machine had the same problem , the location was perfect for transportation The rooftop bar was beautiful for the views 
415563,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, No help with luggage either when coming or going out from hotel No door men to help with things opening doors etc, Location Quite place Bath room nice spacious and clean View excellent
415564,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Breakfast not at the level of the hotel Upgraded the room to a more expensive one with terrace but terrace was facing swimming pool thus sitting there would mean everybody looking at you Very loud room with people not letting you sleep till 2 in the morning Normal room far away from pool would have been better Waiters in front of hotel and lady at the breakfast desk could say hallo wish a nice day would not cost a penny , Position of hotel friendly staff at the desk 
415565,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Despite the pluses I still think this was not rly value for money Because we booked thru booking com we had breakfast in a separate dining area but it was only basic continental Breakfast in the main dining area was very busy not enough machines for tea and coffee , Location brilliant next to to metro and buses Roof terrace amazing both view and comfortable loungers 
415566,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, bar service food next to the pool meals are too expensive but not good enough the staff seems overworked too much time of waiting problems to pay with credit cards parking price is too expensive but i had to take it as i had rented a car, location cleanliness room service
415567,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, The location is premium just walking distances to every public transport easy to travel to every places in barcelona also near a mall restaurants supermarket etc Very near montjuic and we can see the montjuic fountain show from the rooftop we love this hotel and surely will recommend to anyone 
415568,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The above was supposed to be of what I did not like , We booked 2 connecting rooms due to young kids and got what booked However on the first night and next morning we found lots of bedbugs in both rooms beds and the skirtings of the bed which is not obviously changed with each customer The bedbugs were all over the place We alerted staff who changed us to other 2 connecting rooms other side of the same floor However these rooms were with dirtiest of floors I ve ever seen and even after 2 3 requests to clean the floors the cleaning ladies only shortly brushed the areas It was like walking on street with sand and who knows what Further requests did not even get filled I had in my own room no aircon working for the whole 3 day stay with sweaty nights No amount of complaining helped to get any change in this predicament At last morning before leaving we found bedbugs in these rooms as well I did get a promise of refund on no aircon room though but am still waiting for it Hotel is generally super dirty all trough corridors and ceilings and sitcoms and especially the rooms No real cleaning happening and on top of that you will personally feed a legion of bedbugs during your stay 
415569,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, the rooms are a little dated kind of like staying in a Travelodge , Lovely pool area great seating and nice view Great staff security guards and staff at the pool were really friendly and helpful 
415570,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, It is not 4 star hotel Unsilenced walls You can hear what people say in the room next to You when they take bath etc Lack of carpet in the hallway rooms Very poor breakfast Cleaning stuff doesn t speak english Rooms unclean , Localization close to metro station 
415571,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, for the amount of money paid I expected a more comfortable bed especially that the extra bed was really really bad and uncomfortable, Staff were very helpful
415572,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, Easily a four star with an excellent location on Plaza Espana Major shopping centre across the road Magic Fountain is less than 5 minutes away Very central 
415573,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, Helpful stuff nice location perfect hotel position near from the metro station the breakfast was soo delicious and there was a big variety in the food types 
415574,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Unfriendly staff This is the No not possible hotel whatever you ask the answer is no not possible Very noisy room despite being in a suite on the 7th floor Cannot charge the room when ordering from the bar near the pool Must be cash We had to ask 3 times to have our luggage stored reception pointed at door man door man pointed at reception , Nice view from the pool 
415575,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The entire experience was really bad The staff here are pathetic to say the least Absolutely no level of service We requested an early check in which they said they will try to accommodate but when we reached they told us they can T No problems there am assuming they tried I reached at 2 and tried to check in The lady at the counter told me that the check in was from 2pm not at 2pm To top it off she was not at all inviting and quite blunt Front desk is not staffed adequately and I had to wait in line for 30 minutes yes you read that right 30 minutes to just get a room Post that the guy who takes the luggage to the room was not there and I had to wait for another 15 30 minutes as they had only one guy So I ended up taking the luggage myself They didn t even have the courtesy to tell me that they will have it delivered Once we got a room the hand shower was leaking which was fixed promptly We had some meal which we wanted to heat and we thought we will ask for room service I know it was a special request but when we called them the lady at counter told us rudely that this is a hotel and not an apartment and if we wanted all these facilities we shouldn t have come here I mean there is a nicer way to put things I don t think I am asking too much here Basically post that avoided all interaction with the staff I would definitely NOT recommend this place unless there is not other hotel left to stay in Paris The staff will make you feel this small You deserve better , There is nothing good except the location and the view from the terrace I guess 
415576,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The wait at check in in reception Cost of parking at the hotel Arrival in a car was a challange as no where to park outside the hotel and no directions to the underground car park , Comfort of beds and air conditioning
415577,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, For a family with 3 children the family suite was perfect We were on the 12th floor which gave us a fabulous view too The rooftop pool was stunning and v stylish 
415578,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, It was an amazing hotel and staff and experience Thanks so much We loved every moment of our stay there Me and my wife had one of our best ever experiences of a trip there We will go back there hopefully soon 
415579,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, The rooftop pool area and breakfast was very nice The hotel was also close to both buses and trains The room was comfortable and air conditioning was nice in the warm weather Overall would stay again 
415580,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Really unfriendly staffwhen they had to something slightly out of the norm such as asking for some ice to take to the room In general not very polite No tea coffee making facility in room ,No Positive
415581,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The hotel management seems to have a No philosophy based on lots of rules Definitely not the easy going Barcelona type establishment No to traditional room service choices were tele pizza and very expensive and error prone Japanese no to helping us out with our AppleTV connection no to taking a beer from the pool to the room etc You get the idea Big hotel with zero personality Many of the staff tried their best but it just felt like management runs the place by the numbers and the rules not by the heart A pity Almost forgot English language skills were generally poor We try to speak Spanish of course but basics such as asking for a hot water pot answer was no were difficult at best , The beds are good and top floors are quiet
415582,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Uncomfortable pillows to sleep on No kettle or tea and coffee in rooms Basic service poolside I ordered a cocktail for 12EUR On the rooftop bar in the evening and there were no serviettes drip mats or nibbles etc offered which I would have expected for this standard of hotel , Location pool and helpful staff on reception 
415583,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The front desk was always under staffed and not very well informed , Right near the metro and bus stops Gorgeous roof top pool and bar overlooking the city 
415584,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The rooms were poor standard rooms looked into court yard which was dark ugly Small rooms Air con wasn t controllable other than on or off Breakfast like a canteen in looks quality But the desk staff were very nice found a room with a better view that didn t smell of cigarettes Didn t feel I could complain about the breakfast aircon Ate breakfast at cafe next door , The pool is great
415585,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Noise noise noise Rooms have paper walls Breakfast in a huge hall Cheap and average Rooftop poor no seats Help with directions etc poor, Position 
415586,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Breakfast was more like 3 star did not like the location for Breakfast un uncosy Hall loud medium Quality of food room was not so clean, Location very good rooftop pool and bar very nice room was ok bed comfortable German TV good Restaurants arround the corner
415587,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The room had not been cleaned properly for some time There was dust on the wooden floor on the bedside lamps and the TV Alerted reception but nothing done , Staff very friendly location great right on a major square near to transport and shopping
415588,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Pool pool bar staff could have been more helpful and attentive No TV in siting room only in bedroom , Booked a suite and got a suite of fair size 
415589,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Cleaners in the morning just seemed to be leaving doors bang behind them it seemed to go on for ages, Location is perfect view from pool was excellent very clean hotel
415590,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Poolside bar staff came across ignorant and rude which we found out on the first night of being there Prices for drink at the poolside were far higher The breakfast we only done once due to not enough options of food to choose from when you had finally went to pick something you wanted it would be sold out and the whole area being way too hectic for that time in the morning , The hotel was in an excellent location and perfect for what we were looking for The hotel itself lived up to our expectations and was immaculate Staff at the reception desk were wonderful and really helpful 
415591,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Staff rude slow and unhelpful Checking in took half an hour First room we had fridge didn t work Then key card wouldn t work Came back to room after an hour the room smelt of sewage Practically had to beg for new room, Location was good although it meant it was noisey as you are on a roundabout with a lot of traffic Room was big with facilities
415592,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, There were 3 single beds in the bedroom that could have been of better quality There were no coffee tea making facilities I have experienced better in lesser rated hotels I found it expensive because any food was extra will try another hotel next time , Hotel was in a very good location with beautiful surroundings to the front The swimming pool and its facilities on top of the hotel were also very good 
415593,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Some staffs at reception never smiled but my visit period was a real high season full booked very crowded So that was understandable In the bathroom there were small things in need of renovation showerhead taps etc , Location for public transport users is great Rooftop swimming pool was absolutely the best and the staffs at the bar were very friendly Room cleanness and comfort were also good 
415594,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The bar prices were very expensive Our room was stuck in a corner on the 7 th floor with a view of a brick wall and rooftop junk yard disappointing when you consider the views the other rooms had , The roof top bar was beautiful The rooms were large and spotless The restsurant food was amazing especially the Seafood Ravioli but the place lacked a bit of atmosphere 
415595,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Service at the roof top bar was slow could do with some extra staff , Rooftop pool and bar had amazing views over Barcelona The location was excellent the aerobus bus stop is directly outside as well as the metro 
415596,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The check in took 45 minutes Overall the staff is really friendly but also really slow , Wonderful spacious room with a magnificent view Excellent breakfast The rooftop pool and area are absolutely great 
415597,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Disappointed with relatively few reception staff who are challenged with almost fully booked hotel with obvious language barrier issues and disorganized way of handling crowd at reception , Highly recommend for the location facing plaza Espa a and magic fountain And away from the noisey and crowded la rambla 
415598,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Drinks and food very expensive at pool Longers and beds go quickly when hotel so busy this season u must be up early , Loved the loungers and area by pool Beautiful views Metro on your doorstep of hotel Fab location 
415599,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Bad muzak from pool bar and terrible singer pianist in lounge made it noisy and difficult to relax in public areas Lifts were unpredictable and would be more secure if they had room key card access only Not enough sun shading on roof, Location by Metro View from rooftop pool Rooftop pool beds and pool
415600,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Same food everyday have to transfer to other lift to have access to the pool television don t have english channel have to go to reception for the lock of the safety volts, Nice hotel they gave us a room with a nice view near shoppping centre walking distance to the fountain comfort bed and room taxi is waiting outside the hotel access to train station is only outside the hotel kids loves the pool if i ll go back to Barcelona I will surely stay in the same hotel
415601,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The staff were extremely slow in fulfilling requests and they seemed aloof , The facilities were good The location is perfect Not in the middle of an touristy area easily accessible by all modes of transportation and a beautiful view of the square 
415602,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Needs more lounges seating areas by the pool , Very pleasant and quiet hotel 
415603,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, The staff at the poor bar, The room and the views plus it was great to have a shopping mall right next door
415604,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,No Negative, Fabulous hotel with fabulous staff The location was perfect as were the facilities We had such a lovely stay
