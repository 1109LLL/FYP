152582,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse,No Negative, Cappuccino at reception area was great and available 24hrs with a choice of a fresh fruit every day all complimentary Staff was really nice very friendly and always helpful 
152583,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, the facilities are a bit old which is not very value for money the quilt is too warm which made me sweat it is not easy to get a portable hair dryer the built in hair dryer in the room is too slow fridge not clean there is ant on table , i booked a twin bedroom but on first day i only got a double bedroom but the staff was so nice to arrange a twin bedroom afterwards overall the room is clean and tidy towel warmer in bathroom is very useful 
152584,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, The apparent breakfast looked pretty underwhelming Picked over and not much there to choose from We passed it up , Sarah the desk clerk was outstanding Very helpful and pleasant 
152585,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, The too was so small there was hardly anywhere for luggage The two twin beds were literally touching each other and barely room to walk around them , Friendly staff
152586,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Jean could possibly do with some hospitality course He was cold and rude from the moment go and the hotel has absolutely no view Well the toilets are small the sofa seats in the room are torn and the location isn t tempting The lift in the hotel is in a dire state and require a schindler or any standard lift to replace it If you would love to stay in a dungeon this is a perfect horror home The chain shouldn t be lending its name to such a hotel , Absolutely nothing but the bunker beds in the room The reception has one person who is hospitable Sarah but that would not compensate the lack of warmth and hospitality offered by Jean
152587,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, The room was quite small and although we had air conditioning it felt quite claustrophobic at night We were unable to open the window because of the level of street noise which was a bit disappointing as I had requested a quiet room although in fairness it was quiet with the window shut, great location near good transport links and reasonably priced and good restaurants There was a super boulangerie and fruit and veg shop nearby great for buying picnic stuff
152588,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, As above, The room was not as clean as expected there was a bad smell in the room and the tv kept jumping and going off so couldn t watch tv The coffee machine in reception didn t always work and there was not a lot of section for breakfast After a long travel you would not feel like walking for feed
152589,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Elevator was very small barely able to fit two people , Very close to public transportation both tram and bus are easily accessible Hotel room was great and close to restaurants and boulangeries 
152590,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, The temperature of the room Got warm so I opened the window Sometimes little noise from the corridor or other room if someone is walking by , My stay was nice The property is near a very vibrant area of montparnasse with good shopping The receptionists were so nice and welcoming and helpful especially Sarah and Kamilla Free apples and tea were in the reception 
152591,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, The receptionist was horrible The staffs are not nice or courteous or even professional They laugh together They re telling their intimate life before the customer Such a shame , The room was okay
152592,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Room not soundproof inside and outside Beds a bit too soft Breakfast overpriced, Cleanliness of room and facilities Wi Fi Choice of coffee and tea
152593,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse,No Negative, Even though slightly outside the centre we found the location a welcome retreat from the throng of the city centre There were lovely bakeries on the road and plenty of restaurants only 5 minutes away The beds was very comfortable and the free soft drinks in the room were gratefully received We had the mezzanine room which was excellent as we travelled with 2 children who had a floor to themselves All in all a wonderful experience The only words of advice would be that there was one small lift and a very tight spiral staircase something to consider for those who have difficulty walking 
152594,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, The room was prepared for us but some important stuff was overlooked Luggage from the previous guest pizza in the fridge pizza box on the window ledge We informed reception but they forgot to remove the pizza and it was still there when we left , The location is great and the breakfast was good Our room was small but very comfortable 
152595,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, The guy at the reception was not really welcoming While it was caring about our registration it went talking with another customer I didn t like that really a lot The hotel is supposed to be 4 stars but I didn t find anything special about it the room was really small Not really a 4 stars hotel, The position close to the station 
152596,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Bed too short tiny room tiny closet tiny bathroom etc Stars given in booking com are absolutely wrong I would not give more than 2 stars For what you get there the price is impertinent , Staff was friendly 
152597,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Not a 4 star hotel as advertised The rooms and bathroom were super small with limited space I could hear the bed squeaking in the room next door like there was an open door or window No English channels on tv No parking on site had to pay 35 for parking The breakfast was not all that the eggs were warm and the bacon always ran out The last day I was there the elevator broke , The location was decent The female staff was very helpful and spoke English 
152598,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Sink was clogged upon arrival and therefore would not drain Although our floor was non smoking which we wanted smoke from people smoking on other floors filtered through the air conditioning vents and therefore made our room stink of smoke which was horrible for sleeping and made all my clothes smell of smoke Room was small dark and basic I think the hotel was overpriced for what it was but maybe that s the norm for Paris hotels , Staff were friendly though not all spoke English They gave us bottles of water and chocolate and toiletries for free Location was good with lots of stores and food nearby Tour Montparnasse was a 10 min walk away 
152599,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, a little tired but generally quiet and comfortable in a busy part of Paris , The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the rooms bigger than average for a Paris hotel Very close to Montparnasse station walking distance with bags Good local restaurants nearby

152602,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, The only thing was the breakfast Go there early as I was there at 10 and caffe was cold orange juice a little warm and omelette was over cooked and had a strange look still my friend at it and it was god , It was a great surprise booked the same day and wasn t sure what to find The place is not far from parking and from metro room we had was an upgrade and it was very well cleaned The reception staff was nice

152607,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, to small room hotel didnt look like 4 stars one bathroom was very old and little and the door from bathroom was looking all the time u need somwbody to push it from outside to open if not u get stuck in the bathroon, nice locations clean room clean sheets big tv staff is ok but i dont see why its 4 stars hotel 
152608,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Linen was gray rather than white They leave tea coffee and drinking chocolate pouches but one of each For a couple this is rubbish , Central location for Gare Montparnasse only 3 minutes walking distance 
152609,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, There is not enough choice for breakfast especially since the charge is 13 , The young Algerian woman at the desk was fantastic She s completely fluent in both French and English 
152610,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Only one of our rooms had a bath so maybe check with reception that your room has a bath and not just a shower if you like baths like me , the free coffee in the reception area was the best we could find in the local area and it was FREE too Nice comfy bed and quiet Really close to the metro station to get you into paris 
152611,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, The location is a little rough There was one gentleman who worked the front desk who was a bit dismissive Also the lift only worked about the time whilst only 1 of the 2 stair wells is lit , Room was well appointed efficient use of space clean friendly staff for the most part A C was a highlight given the heatwave Paris experienced while we were there 
152612,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Quite small rooms and bathrooms but balanced against the cost this was fine, Excellent breakfast all required faciliteis computer with printer Wi Fi Clean efficient friendly staff

152616,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Better partnerships with cabs tours etc The front desk called a cab company to take us to Versaille and explained that we only had to call them to have them pick us up When we called they were not available Luckily we were able to find a local cab to take us back to Paris By aligning with companies perhaps discounts can be made available , Excellent staff housekeeping Very responsive 
152617,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Location was OK a good taxi drive to any landmarks and a couple of decent cafes and restaurants around though, Beds are very soft and comfy if you like that sort of thing TVs and bathroom were both great if not a little cramped Room was basic and a decent size

152623,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Lift worked 2 days out of 4 we were on the 5th floor Breakfast was extremely over priced food was basic not worth 13pppn rooms were very small although there was a kettle there wasn t much choice of tea coffee Stairs felt unsafe as was a spiral tripped up a couple of times from the 5th floor when lift wasn t working Manager was extremely rude sarcastic when it was pointed out that the lift was out of order again We had to carry heavy suitcases down from the 4th 5th floor , Bed was really comfy it was nice to have free tea coffee facilities in the lobby modern tv free daily water bottles in the room 24hr reception not far from the station good restaurants 10 15 mins walk away 
152624,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Walls were very thin could hear every sound Lift was out of order on checkout so going down the spiral staircase with bags was a bit tricky though I felt worse for the family with 2 kids we passed coming up the stairs with huge suitcases thought staff could have helped given there were 3 people on the desk at that time , Staff were friendly and helpful Just 5 minutes from the nearest Metro station Rooms were small but to be expected otherwise comfortable
152625,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, room very small Very hot february even with heat turned off Bath very difficult to get out of , staff keen to help Self serve quick breakfast Open 24 h 24 Could leave luggage for late departure 
152626,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Extremely small rooms were to be expected for the area and price Along with poor ventilation and inadequate climate control sleep was also disrupted by cigarette smoke from an adjoining room paper thin walls and noisy staff early in the morning , The most comfortable bed 
152627,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse,No Negative, The staff were approachable and helpful The room was big enough for all of us The location was central The tourist advice they gave us was excellent The rooms were incredibly clean The Internet was free and speedy and the fridge had great snacks 
152628,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Sound proofing not great our neighbours upstairs were certainly seeing in the new year with a bang , Good location well looked after albeit small rooms 
152629,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, The room is small but it is Paris and how much time do you spend in it other than sleeping The bathroom was roomy The pillows aren t great But really we were there for 6 nights and had a great time , Loved the location we walked to many of the major attractions The Met was nearby and Montparnasse station was close for transfers The staff all spoke English and were very friendly and welcoming The free coffee and fruit in the lobby was a bonus There was seating in the lobby to have your coffee or read the paper Fridge in the room was great 
152630,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, hotel makes noise via vacuum Cleaner or cleaning other ways at 8am uniterested in the rest of their clients Its the second time this happens Thanks, The beds

152632,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Nothing , The location is close to Gaite and Pernety metro station Also close to Airport shuttle bus stop and Montpartnass train station The coffee machine at lobby is free to guest The staff is friendly and helpful 
152633,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Small room and the water in bathroom was not so hot except sometimes , Clean rooms and very helpful staff You have to walk a bit in order to reach the hotel from the metro station 
152634,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, You have to be extra insistent if you want or need to sleep in Housekeeping will knock on your door or even ring your phone even though you put the do not disturb sign Jet lagged travelers attention inform the concierge in advance you are willing to forgo housekeeping for a day if you don t want to be waken up , Good French Service Super clean FAST internet really ComplimentaryTea and Coffee and Chocolate and Fruit in the lobby all day and night 
152635,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, The hotel in montparnasse is not close to the main city attractions still it is close to public transportation Breakfast was really poor not much variety and not very good quality and 13 for the type of breakfast it is is very expensive I suggest having breakfast outside as there are many Parisian cafes with great deals for hummy breakfasts , All of the staff were incredible nice with us Rooms are quite spacious for what it is expected in cities like Paris I booked last minute the day before and I was able to find a great deal Price quality ratio couldn t be better If you arrive to Paris by air by CDG airport or Orly this is a good option once one of the bus stops for this airports is 5 10 mins walking distance from the hotel 
152636,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, The room was really small and the walls were paper thin I could hear too much of what was going on outside my room , Loved the breakfast served downstairs but space was a bit of a congested 
152637,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Not worth the money paid very small room an I know that in general rooms are smaller in Europe but not this small Very hot and no a c working had to open windows at night with 50 degrees , Perhaps the location
152638,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Small nits Tried to contact hotel about logistics from CDG Phone did not allow to speak to a person just repeated prerecorded message Similarly no response to email on this No air conditioning just heating Website did not provide info on getting there from CDG using metro , Great location Clean room Close to local eateries and metro Perenity 
152639,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, The temperature in the breakfast room cellar was too warm Made breakfast a bit uncomfortable Hit the breakfast room early before it gets too busy , The staff were very friendly and helpful The room was clean and very comfortable The small downstairs lounge was a enjoyable addition to our stay Bretagne is a great location if you want to rub shoulders with the locals and still be close enough to the Paris sites Recommend the walk to the Eiffel Tower 
152640,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Nothing bad only nice impressions , Very nice and polite personal Easy to find come and go even by metro Not so far from the nearest two metro station Very silent comfortable clean Every day cleaning if nessesary towel change bath accesories tea coffe chocolate We were very impressed of this hotel and the personnel Next our station at Paris will be BEST WESTERN BRETAGNE MONTPARNASSE
152641,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Face clothe were full of makeup or shoe polish The room was very small the door covering the fridge was falling off screws were pulled our Reported it and it wasn t fix in our two day stay , Location
152642,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, I know it has to do with the location but the price is a bit on the high side for the value you get I would have also liked a room price including breakfast but can also understand why it is charged separately , Conveniently located hotel near several facilities such as metro stations a train station several restaurants and bars I loved the bed and pillow which are often questionable 
152643,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse,No Negative, We stayed in a 5th floor mezzanine room which was ideal for our party of three children and two adults The room was spacious and comfortable plus well stocked with tea coffee and toiletries There were plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby and it was easy to commute to other areas from here We wouldn t hesitate to stay here again or recommend to another family 
152644,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, What I saw was miserable including staff behavior manager s behavior and quality of services This hotel s value is not more than 50 Euro per night and it is not a 4 star hotel at all I do not recommend it at all as we changed our hotel after the first night , Actually nothing really nothing
152645,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, The bathrooms in some rooms are very outdated , The bed was a bit small but very comfortable and they had coffee and fruit available at all times around the reception 24 hour reception is a plus The rooms are small but comfortable enough 
152646,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Did not consider value for money for the room considering the Best Western Hotels we have stayed in in the U K Could not open a suitcase without using the bed , Not being stuck in the central tourist area gave a good insight into daily Paris life 
152647,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, The stairs were very narrow and bit dark , Staff was very pleasant and happy to help Always proposing candies to Kids Free Apples water was always available 
152648,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, The AC didn t work very well when I stayed in the quadruple room The cleaning staff were unfriendly and we re talking to me n a clearly irritated tone when I told them that I was not ready for my room to be cleaned yet they kept knocking on my room s for room service despite the very clear Don t Disturb sign Now I am good at putting people right in their places which I did with the cleaning staff But no hotel customer should be treated that way by any staff The hotel management really needs to work on that , As a frequent traveler to Paris I loved the hotel s location It is in a very local residential area of Montparnasse There are some local un touristy cafes and restaurants around the area which made my experience very French The staff we re very helpful and friendly in providing all the information we asked for Especially Kamila she was exceptionally helpful and very warm AND hilarious The hotel is 3 4 minutes walk to M13 metro station Pertney 
152649,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, It was not as a 4 star hotel It was a small hotel with a small lobby The building was old but the rooms were renovated Closet in the room did not have enough space There was not even toothbrush or toothpaste in the room , Cleanliness was perfect

152651,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, Dear sir madam I am wondering if this was a hotel I couldn t even categorise it to a 4 star hotel the whole time it smelled bad the pictures in web site didn t match with the reality Here seems to be a guest house rather than a hotel the rooms were not spacious enough so that it was hard to move ,No Positive
152652,Best Western Bretagne Montparnasse, the staircase was not very clean considering that the lift is very small more attention should be paid to the cleanliness of the staircase , the location is very convenient close to the train station Montparnasse as well as Gaite The staff are very welcoming the streets are not noisy and beds are comfortable
