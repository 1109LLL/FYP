393480,Luxury Suites Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff are really helpful and go out there way to help you in any way The hotel it self is just fabulous very modern with the most comfy beds Defiantly would stay again Good Value for money Thank you to all the staff 
393481,Luxury Suites Amsterdam, Nothing really The few things that aren t in the hotel are clearly mentioned like no pool sauna and are hard to get in a city centre hotel anyway , Everything This is quite possibly the best hotel we have EVER stayed in or at least among the top 3 and this is from over a hundred hotels in half as many countries Hats off to the staff and management of this little gem To elaborate more everything from the moment we walked in to the time we checked out was near perfect with much personal attention and warmth from the excellent staff 24 7 This is a very family friendly hotel right at check in at 11pm no less our two year old was given a choice of toys books candy etc to pick by the warm staff members and his face was beaming the whole trip We were upgraded to the Royal Suite free of cost as we were a family and the extra space and facilities were a big advantage for us They even order in any food or cuisine you can look up online or just prefer and they ll order from their recommended restaurants and bring it up set it in the room for you at any given time we ate after midnight on the night we arrived There is also valet parking for 35 euro per day a huge convenience at a reasonable price right in the city centre no need to bother with parking garages and running around with luggage Free bottle of wine and Dutch chocolates in the room many nice little touches like that The suites themselves combine the best aspects of luxury apartments and a luxury 4 star hotel You have a huge beautifully furnished suite with a balcony overlooking the canal There is a full facility kitchen with plates stove fridge freezer dishwasher etc which was very handy for us making and storing meals for our 2 year old At the same time it is fully serviced and you don t need to worry about cleaning up etc and there are plenty of cuisines to choose from in this thriving city There are multiple large flat screen smart TVs in the rooms both with internet access so again for families it is quite handy and you can watch surf separate channels at the same time 
393482,Luxury Suites Amsterdam, Sometimes felt a little out of the way but only like a ten minute walk to the main part , It was very luxurious staff were lovely we got a complementary drink and chocolates upon arrival

393485,Luxury Suites Amsterdam, The establishment is very nice the room very spacious and very well equiped the staff very polite and helpful BUT in my case the airconditioning was not working in heat mode The receptionist tried to make it work but after failing did not change the room for us although I insisted on the matter So we were left to spent our night deep into the bed covers with the help of a tiny air heater But that was only the beginning of our problems since at 1 am a guest was trying to get into the room by banging on the door and shouting That happens you would say but he only left to return with a hotel employee who also tried to get into the room That was a first Since there is no fisheye on the door I thought I would call the police but after half an hour they eventually went away whomever they were Definitely a night to remember but for the wrong reasons To their defense the next morning the overpriced breakfast was offered for free , New luxury clean good location
393486,Luxury Suites Amsterdam,No Negative, We loved everything The reception area where you walk in is beautiful staff were very friendly and helpful providing us with a detailed map of the city We were also left a bottle of champagne and chocolates in our room as we mentioned when booking that we had recently got engaged we thought this was a very nice gesture We will definitely be returning 
393487,Luxury Suites Amsterdam, We were charged extra for every single bottle of plastic water although it was mentionned to us initially that it s free Also It s not very easy to find the location but we got used to it on the second day Extended checkout after 12 is not permitted , Probably the best hotel in Amsterdam The most comfortable i have ever been Amazing people and receptionsits specially Michella who was a great support Generally Dutch people are extremely friendly and helpful all the time 
393488,Luxury Suites Amsterdam, Despite it being a very quiet canal side location the Hotel through the night was very noisy heavy fire doors were constantly banging all the way through to the early hours As for the Luxury suite it was nice but we booked the standard suite and at best it was a junior suite with kitchen facilities that would be handy if you were there for a prolonged stay The bathroom was small large shower though but no bath The view was non existent it was the 1st Floor and looked straight into a brick wall At 571 00 euros for 2 Nights it was expensive for what we had Despite the price no Breakfast which I m glad I didn t book self catering 1 Star or 2 Star USA Motel style , Excellent Location short walk from Amsterdam Central Staff were always available if needed and egger to please
