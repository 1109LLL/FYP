345930,Hotel Mercure Wien City, No smoking inside the whole preperty The air conditioner was terrible although the staff offered to move us to another room but the problem as i think was the central control unit coz it worked porperly for two days, Bed is extra comy staff is super friendly close to schewedenplatz room was really clean 
345931,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Generally the breakfast offer was poorer and not that good as compared to other Mercure hotels for example Ostrava The hotel is located in quite an old building and you can tell it from the rooms design and equipment On the other hand location is a great advantage it s just a few minutes walk from the heart of the old town , The hotel is very conveniently located it took us 5 mins to get to the centre of the Old Town and st Stephen s Church Staff at the des was very helpful upon arrival we were offered a free of charge old city tour with ENG guide to be held the next day morning which was absolutely great and make our 1 day in Vienna a great experience The building is quite old obviously it is located in historic part of the city and you can tell it by design of the rooms bathroom etc But everything is clean and neat and the service very good In the bathroom I prefer a shower cabin rather than a bath with a glass screen that we received but it was ok Overall worth recommending and certainly a very good choice when travelling to or through Vienna with 1 day visiting capacity the service is very good and the location gives an advantage of getting to top vienna spots by foot in 5 to 15 mins both to the old town as well as to Prater 
345932,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Narrow corridors Only one elevator and that was slow at times , Close to city center Clean rooms with all the basic amenities Clean functional toilets Helpful staff Aircon in Rooms 
345933,Hotel Mercure Wien City, the price per room was too much considering the way the hotel looked it was clean but you could see it was a bit old and the rooms a bit kitchy also the parking was extremly expensive 22 euros per night is huge also there are only rooms for 3 people max if you are a couple with two kids there is no way to stay comfortable , the location was fairly close to the center
345934,Hotel Mercure Wien City, The breakfast was very basic with lesser options The room was very congested even after upgrading to a bigger one May be that s how the rooms in the city are , It was conveniently located as we could walk to most places of interest 
345935,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Staff outside smoking when we arrived Room very small no where to sit except the bed and one chair Only enough long life milk for one cup of tea, The location was good The bathroom was midern
345936,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Parking is quite expensive Privilege room is quite small if you are tall you have to make some tricks to sit on the toilet , Nice location attentive staff well looking rooms in Mercure style 
345937,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Pillows need to be replaced flat as pancakes and an English TV other than news would be nice but not a big problem , Breakfast was good staff were super friendly and helpful The room was small but they had lots of little nooks places to strore our bags belongings 
345938,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Tiny rooms looking over a noisy street very basic breakfast selection I would only consider that hotel for below 100 EUR night , Nice maintained hotel but a joke for the room rate The staff was very friendly 
345939,Hotel Mercure Wien City, By the time you ve added the costs of breakfast city tax etc it s poor value for money given the very limited hotel facilities , Very convenient for connection to the airport and close to city centre and metro station 
345940,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Nothing, Perfect location perfectly decorated rooms very clean good value for money I did not found a room near centre for 85 euros per day you can take your chance 
345941,Hotel Mercure Wien City, 1 A massive width double bed but two individual duvets which are not as wide as a UK single bed duvet so periodically at night you woke up cold as the duvet had shifted away from you This is NOT just this hotel all in Austria seem to do it 2 A single lift is not enough At busy periods too much waiting around also if you are on an upper floor and signal to go down the lift stops on your floor even when it is going to higher floors confusing and annoying , Very helpful staff on reception and in the breakfast room
345942,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Housekeeping staff were quite lax No towels no replacement sugars that sort of thing They were also very noisy in the corridor in the morning , Desk and bar staff were lovely As was their wine selection And there s a pizza take away next door that does a brilliant Margherita 
345943,Hotel Mercure Wien City, no TV channels in English apart from BBC, All perfect since the first moment the stuff really helpful even printed something for us Extremely clean nice views room fully equipped comfortable bed big bathtub 
345944,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Room looks renewed but bathtub itself is a bit aged , Very central 10 mins walking to St Stephen s Cathedral Friendly staff cozy room Loved this hotel 
345945,Hotel Mercure Wien City, The free WiFi was of very poor quality so that you almost got the impression that it was intentionally low quality in order to get you to pay for premium WiFi We would rather pay a couple of euros more for the room and get a decent quality free WiFi instead , Helpful and efficient reception desk staff
345946,Hotel Mercure Wien City, As the hotel is not too big the room is relatively small but it is still okay It has only restaurant for breakfast , It is not too far from the city center You can almost reach everything within walking distance 
345947,Hotel Mercure Wien City, One tiny thing that wouldnt apply to everyone but would liked to see facecloths given outright not having to call reception for one , Staff were very helpful throughout and are willing to satisfy your every whim Very modern and clean rooms Can t recommend it enough Very central and close to amenities 
345948,Hotel Mercure Wien City, the woman who works at the reception ignored us when we arrived and wanted to check in and kept talking to her colleague very unprofessional because she did it twice , location is good and the room was clean and big enough for two people 
345949,Hotel Mercure Wien City,No Negative, Excellent location as the hotel is 2 3 minutes away from Vienna center as well as from the metro station The room was very comfort with lovely view to the Viennese buildings We had clean room every day and the staff was very willing to help us with guidance etc 
345950,Hotel Mercure Wien City,No Negative, The guy at front reception was exceptionally friendly and warm it was such a nice welcome The location was great the rooms were clean and a decent size A great experience 
345951,Hotel Mercure Wien City, The room was nice but let down by the bathroom that looks like it needs renovating toilet seat was loose , Staff were really friendly and helpful couldn t fault their service 
345952,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Having no air conditioning is winter as i expected as it was written in site as we were told that AC is only in summer that disturbed my sleeping during night due to noise from opening the window, Hotel location was perfect to city center room was adequate to my needs it was clean comfort the staff were very helpful friendly 
345953,Hotel Mercure Wien City, I think there are only two things I didn t like the size of the room for that price mineral water as well as the content of the mini refrigerator was a paid service I didn t use it but I was very surprised to see that comparing with other 4 stars hotels for the same price , I really enjoyed the stay in this hotel The price was a little bit expensive comparing with the sizes of the room and facilities but the hotel is very conveniently located staff is very friendly breakfasts were good enough there was a kettle in the room the room was very clean it was not noisy in the room I mean that I was not disturbed by the noise from the other rooms it was cozy inside the bed was very comfortable I had a good rest there Wi Fi also was available 
345954,Hotel Mercure Wien City, The breakfast was not as good as in other Mercure hotels I ve been before It was okay but nothing to tell home about it , The localization is very convenient 
345955,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Location although fairly central and close to schwedensplatz was a bit out of the way, The barman was friendly The room was air conditioned which was amazing 
345956,Hotel Mercure Wien City,No Negative, Everything in the room was very comfortable and very clean The bathroom was great and the location was perfect We also asked for a late check in and they were waiting for us until we got there from the airport 
345957,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Room was slightly cramped but manageable, Great for overnight stopover Very comfortable and clean with all facilities that we required with a 16mth old baby 
345958,Hotel Mercure Wien City, one of my family her hand bag was stolen from the reception by outsiders and the lobby was not fully covered by cameras and when I talked to the staff no serious action was taken they must inform the police because that damage the hotel reputation making no action from the hotel side sending a negative massage to guests,No Positive
345959,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Breakfast is not too great Cheaper and better options at spar supermarket and other breakfast restaurants, Location is a few streets away from graben but few English speaking restaurant options 
345960,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Room was nice but small Some hair stuck to the wall of the shower which was disgusting I wouldn t consider this a 4 star hotel , Staff were friendly 
345961,Hotel Mercure Wien City, The welcome we received was very poor we weren t even given the room number We were also initially put in the wrong room which was very frustrating We booked a superior double only to be given a standard with 2 single beds pushed together , It was modern and clean and in a pretty good location 
345962,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Asked for ground floor room Booked a prority room Arrived to be told only room on fifth floor available and no priority room After having to make a fuss got a second floor priority room Not much different to a regular room apart from a coffee machine Very small room Slippery shower surface , Location Bed comfy
345963,Hotel Mercure Wien City, The A C was totally inadequate AND it was a hot weekend Complaints to the desk were useless Room was small and stuffy I m sorry I stayed there ,No Positive
345964,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Would have been extra awesome if parking was included in the price of the room but that s about it , Parking was fab location on the canal was brilliant 5 minutes walk to lots of sights near excellent bars and restaurants Almost everything in walking distance Room very comfortable and very clean good size also 
345965,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Room a bit small and cupboard space insufficient for a week s stay The hotel did not have our booking when we arrived and told us we arrived a day early despite the fact that our confirmation for the rooms clearly stated the day of our arrival , Generally the atmosphere in the hotel was very pleasant and staff most obliging
345966,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Room was too small very high room rates If you look photograps at booking com it seems perfect But when you open the door you realize the trurth After check out i had time for the flight and i need to change my clothes I ask the guy at the reception he told me you can in the toilet ,No Positive
345967,Hotel Mercure Wien City, No sting in the tail, The sting the bottle of mineral water you think is complementry on leaving they sting you for 3 60 per bottle so will never stay with mercure again they have just lost a regular customer 
345968,Hotel Mercure Wien City, It s a nice hotel in a great location I would definitely stay here again But I don t understand why it s rated as 4 The decor and the cleanliness are more akin to a 3 hotel e g chipped paint on doorframes dark carpets bathroom was clean but not sparkling in the way that you get with a 4 Also there wasn t a proper desk chair where you could do work only a bedside table without a chair , The bed and pillows were really comfy I didn t wake up once during the night Nice breakfast Very central 10 mins walk to stefans cathedral Lots of restaurants nearby Easy access to the vienna international centre 5 stops on the U bahn if you re there for a conference Room was quiet no disturbances from outside or other rooms 
345969,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Mind the location it is just outside the city centre 10 min walk to the fancy shopping area on graben kartner and Stephansplatz All other sights are a lot further walk but from schwedenplatz you have metro or tram Also taxi is very affordable The only thing was that the room was very warm It is on a central system so they couldn t adjust it And they had some renovation going on but this we hardly noticed , Mercure city hotel is very clean rooms are decorated homely and warm no noise can be heard from the street rooms equiped with everything you need and daily cleaned refreshed Super friendly staff always helped with a smile and happy to help with any request breakfast was lovely many choices There s a computer where you can print for free and good wifi in the room
345970,Hotel Mercure Wien City,No Negative, The service was great and the bed was extra comfy We checked in almost at midnight so we had to wait for the front desk clerk who also doubled as the bartender 
345971,Hotel Mercure Wien City, The lift near the kitchen was not functioning some of the times , Receptionist Balasz as very helpful Clean and newly refurbished room Central location 
345972,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Nothing , We we re in Vienna for New Year and after problems in another hotel we booked at short notice and got a room at this Novotel Staff fantastic hotel is q city novotel rooms are top clean and the location is just 10 minutes on foot from St Stefan s Cathedral Great location and handy for our New Year party booking at the Sofitel Sky Bar 
345973,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Noisy the cleaning ladies were very noisy while carrying their stuff down the halls a lot of noise also coming from the street the bathroom has a gliding door which doesn t close properly so you couldn t have your privacy heating was working all the time and had some trouble sleeping because it was too hot, Clean room clean sheets good location near the center helpful staff
345974,Hotel Mercure Wien City, No maps of vienna city provided at reception , The location is very good It s just 5 minutes walk to airport bus at Morzinplatz and Schwedenplatz metro station Ringtram and also tram lines are also very nearby It was a pleasant stay We had no issues at all Our room was big enough There is complimentary coffee and tea in room 
345975,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Does not warrant 4 star rating and is overpriced no restaurant facilities at lunch or dinner We stayed in 2 separate rooms and first was quite small Decor dated, The location is good within 10 minutes walk of all public transport breakfast buffet good Staff were very helpful
345976,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Everything esp the bathroom bath accessories breakfast not so polite polished staff very narrow lift for the entire property , Only part I liked is nearness to Metro station which other hotels around the city centre has also got Other thing is giving USB port in flat screen TV for guests to play their own movies
345977,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Tv was only in German could not switch to English when in Ibiza in the summer Tv was in Spanish but could be switched to English, So close to the city staff helpfull helped us book tickets for a show it was a nice experience
345978,Hotel Mercure Wien City, Didn t take the breakfast as it was a rip off above 20 but there is a really nice bakery right next to the hotel closed on Sundays though where i got a substantial breakfast for 6 , Excellent location very comfy bed
345979,Hotel Mercure Wien City, The room view wasn t particularly inspiring but it is a city location so really to be expected, The location was perfect for our needs and it was very easy to get into Vienna or to join a tourist bus or the tram and subway routes The reception staff were particularly helpful when a friend took ill and had to go to hospital giving us access to the room to clear it out and checking if there was anything that we needed them to do

345983,Hotel Mercure Wien City, We did not find any problem in our two days stay We would love to stay here again and highly recommend it, This hotel has a good location It takes ten minutes to reach central area Best thing I found was good air conditioning as the weather was really warm Rooms were small though but with all facilities The staff at the reception were very cooperative and smiling
