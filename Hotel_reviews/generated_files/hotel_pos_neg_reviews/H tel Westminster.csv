43296,H tel Westminster, Could do with a spruce up to be totally up to date Given it s location however this would definitely take it out of this price range , The relaxed traditional atmosphere was particularly appealing The original feeling of the building was also attractive Very comfortable stay 
43297,H tel Westminster, The Staff very disappointing for a hotel of this quality and price They were either just not interested and off hand in dealing with us or quite unclear wrong in the answers they gave to our questions The exception was the doorman who was great the whole time were were there , Excellent location right in the middle of Paris For Paris the room was quite large and was well fitted out and very clean with a modern full bathroom 
43298,H tel Westminster, I would have appreciated having a continental breakfast included in the price of our room As it was breakfast was too expensive and we ate elsewhere The wall between our room and the next allowed the sound of the guests arriving late next door to wake us up We were relieved when on the last two nights of our stay the room next to ours was vacant , The concierge was wonderfully helpful He did a search on specialty wine stores for us to find the perfect one at which to buy a special gift Very friendly staff and the location was without comparison The air conditioning was especially welcome during the June heat wave and the bed very comfortable Big room with old world appointments The bathroom was huge and luxurious and looked onto a lovely court yard The bedroom window looked onto the Rue de la Paix one of the most celebrated streets in Paris just a short stroll from the Louvre and the Rivoli 
43299,H tel Westminster,No Negative, Staff were lovely at all times I really liked the fact they would proactively call to see if there was anything we needed for example a dinner booking or recommendations I have never experienced that previously and it was an excellent touch that made our experience even more enjoyable My partner also loved the dresser in the bathroom where she could get ready each day 
43300,H tel Westminster, The hotel is very expensive We booked the Deluxe double at extra cost On arrival the desk staff told us our room was a bit outdated and small but we could upgrade for an additional 150 This was disappointing as we d spent a lot of money for a nicer standard of room and to be told on arrival our room was a bit substandard before we d even seen it was a bit upsetting The room was indeed small and quite basic The breakfast was a little disappointing as there wasn t a particularly large selection , The staff were fantastic Really helpful and very friendly The hotel is also in a great location just a couple of minutes walk from the nearest metro line and easily walkable to the Louvre 
43301,H tel Westminster, nothing, This was an overnight prior to a European waterways barge cruise The staff was wonderful expecially the doormen This is the first hotel I have ever stayed in that worked things around to let us check in That is a real perk when you have been flying overnight The last trip we were on was to Spain We offered to book a room the night before everything finally when to a spa 
43302,H tel Westminster, The room was extremely old Not worth the money by any means I had stayed there once before and they didn t try to put me in a nicer room They should not be selling those old rooms , Nothing
43303,H tel Westminster, Room hotel could use a facelift very solid and comfortable but getting a bit shabby Not my favorite location in Paris for a strictly leisure trip just because it s dead at night , Great location for our business needs Close to Metro and good shopping Welcoming staff 
43304,H tel Westminster, The shower over the bath didn t work very well which could easily be sorted Our second stay over the last 10 years in this Hotel and would certainly return, lovely hotel made us very welcomed spoke very good in English and understood completely what ever we asked 
43305,H tel Westminster, Room was very dated aircon really struggled and room service was extortionately expensive 66 for a burger side of veg and a glass of wine , Location was great
43306,H tel Westminster, There is no room in their 64 images that matched ours We had to move furniture around to open our suitcases The room was so small the bed was pushed up against the wall and this 70 year old had to scramble over the end of the bed to get in Although clean the sheet was stained The outlook was over the light well with aircons There was no hairdryer and I had to wait an hour before housekeeping brought one , The foyer promises a lovely 4 star stay Shower was good soap was nice 
43307,H tel Westminster, Only minor issue of a lack of power sockets but that did not detract from our stay, Perfect location staff very professional and helpful The room size was excellent No complaints at all 
43308,H tel Westminster,No Negative, It was in a great central location The Hotel food was pricey but you walk out onto the street and you re within 5 10 minute walk of plenty of cafes and restaurants If you don t fancy taking the metro then all the popular landmarks are within walking distance 
43309,H tel Westminster,No Negative, The staff looked after us very well As it was our anniversary weekend they arranged for a bottle of champagne to be waiting in our room for when we arrived The room was beautifully decorated and very clean and comfortable The location of the hotel was amazing and we walked everywhere without the need for public transport I would absolutely stay at the hotel again and I would recommend it anyone 
43310,H tel Westminster, run down hotel room chipped mirror approximative furniture tiny uncomfortable double bed a shower unable to keep its temperature and walls so thin that you could listen to your neighbour s tv unluckily mine kept his on all night and a totally disorganized staff wake up call at 6am that i never requested and they presented me with a bill which was not mine Not only did it take time to rectify all this but not even an apology , just the location
43311,H tel Westminster, noisy if windows left open at night Huge towel rail which couldn t be turned off made the room very hot hence the windows open , Huge room in fact it was a suite 
43312,H tel Westminster, I don t have any major complaints I would go again , The locations was central although it was a very busy area the room was so quite it was as if you where not even in the city The room and bathroom was spacious and comfortable 
43313,H tel Westminster, Couldn t get a table at 08 20 as it was full came back 20 minutes later and was successful Not a big enough dining area for the number of guests If you want to eat dinner at the hotel I recommend reserving a table as we were unable to walk in full again , Breakfast was good if attending early 
43314,H tel Westminster, The hotel was a little old you can see it on the walls and doors , Beautiful room decor with a great spacious bathroom Nice breakfast with tasty Pastries Great location in the center near everything You can leave your bags after the check out and take them later 
43315,H tel Westminster, The carpet in the room was a bit worn out and old fashioned The lighting worked slightly alternating and required some learning , The location of the hotel is excellent Connections from the airport were good and easy to use The hotel is in a good clean and prestigious area In the vicinity there are bars restaurants shops and stores for every purse Excellently manicured hotel service great and breakfast varied and tasty The room Saint Honore was large and tidy decorated with antique furniture An excellent hard wide bed and comfortable lounge area plus a coffee machine added comfort The view of the small but comfortable courtyard at the French Doors was delightful 
43316,H tel Westminster, Unfortunately our room was located next to the very noisy lift Our bathroom sink took about 5 minutes to drain obviously a problem with the drains could just have been our room The only other negative to a pleasant stay was the cost of drinks in the bar On the first night we had a small beer and a glass of wine after coming in from a great day out 22 Euros Needless to say we didn t use the bar again , Very good location and friendly polite staff who were willing to help with any requests 
43317,H tel Westminster, Nothing Service location and staff perfect , Breakfast best ever had at a hotel Staff couldn t do enough Room and facilities to die for Pure quality 
43318,H tel Westminster, although I had booked a superior double room and paid what I consider to be a lot of money it was an extremely small room and rather tired I was very disappointed Plus the walls were very thin so could hear people talking and moving around above and next to our room as well as someone snoring Terrible , the staff were lovely couldn t do enough The breakfasts were delicious and the location was perfect 
43319,H tel Westminster, Creaking floors and 10 stairs to get to an elevator , Location Staff Value for money Breakfast WiFi TV channels English French American Russian etc Public underground parking in 100 meters approx EUR 40 per day 
43320,H tel Westminster, The room we booked was too old and too small and we upgraded to another renovated one and ended up paying fashion week fair an extra 100euro per night The room was not clean although we informed the receptionist on our way out but when we came back it wasn t cleaned either On our last 2 days our used cups of tea were still on the table and there was no water refill in the mini bar the sink still had our toothpaste traces we called housekeeping and they assured us they will clean up once we leave for dinner and when we came back the room was still the same The beds are not very comfy and they have a heating chauffage in the bathroom that is burning hot and so wronly placed that we both burned our hands and arms The breakfast is very poor in variety and presentation although the breakfast staff were very friendly Apon checking out we told the receptionist about the lack of cleanliness there was no apology he only said he will inform them , The Location is excellent the renovated room was nice 
43321,H tel Westminster, The bedroom decor was very tired Paper coming off wall etc Did not like being charged euros6 for a small bottle of water every day a complimentary one would have been nice , The staff were very friendly food was good the location was excellent 
43322,H tel Westminster, The hotel lobby bar could be bigger and offer broader choice, Excellent hotel Right in the downtown Friendly personnel The hotel with charm and atmosphere
43323,H tel Westminster, Our first room was noisy because of the plumbing but we were moved quickly and without fuss, The staff The second room we had was nice In need of a little redecorating 
43324,H tel Westminster, Nothing , Everything about this hotel is pure class Only enhanced by the friendly helpful staff Room was exquisite as is the attention to detail bed was soooo comfy breakfast is superb
43325,H tel Westminster, On our first night we noticed already that the bed they gave us is quite small for 2 persons I complained and requested to be transferred asap According to them they can not transfer us that same night because its impossible They were insistent that our room has a standard bed for 2 persons To prove my point I went to my parents room and measured it by hand I even took a picture to prove that ours was really smaller In the end they apologised and said that indeed that room we got on our first night had a smaller sized bed Yes we got transferred the following night in a room exactly the same as my parents but the damaged has been done We had back pains and did not sleep well ,No Positive
43326,H tel Westminster, The lift is very small but it is an Art Deco original feature The walls in our bathroom were a little thin as we could hear the man in the next room clearly talking on his telephone Having said that our room was on the front of the hotel and we didn t hear any traffic noise in the main room , Staff very friendly and helpful Reception area beautifully presented Room spacious comfy and very clean The breakfast was extensive and of excellent quality Location really excellent Would certainly stay again 
43327,H tel Westminster,No Negative, Great staff location and breakfast Been a customer for a long time and always great The renovated Signature rooms are excellent Bulgari amenities in bathroom All in all a GREAT hotel for Paris 
43328,H tel Westminster, The room was a bit on the smaller side and the fridge in the room was a bit noisy in the night , Good location short walk to the Lourve Place Vendome is only a few minutes away and the Eiffel Tower is in walking distance Room service was particularly good Nice sauna facilities Staff were incredible Nothing was too difficult for them We got sick during our stay and the staff were amazing and organised for us to see the doctor 
43329,H tel Westminster, Maybe this sounds trivial but all the cups in the hotel room and restaurant were so wide brimmed that any tea or coffee drink was cold within minutes Breakfast was acceptable but I doubt the modest size of the dining area can cope during high season , Location is a 10 with the Opera Metro only 100 yds away The deal I got on a suite because of the Jan low season was so worthwhile way over my budget during the season and wouldn t consider staying here otherwise The reception was friendly and efficient 
43330,H tel Westminster, Breakfast was very expensive 30 per person so we chose to eat at the cute French patisseries instead , The staff were friendly and sorted out some confusion with our booking very quickly The hotel was very cozy and in a great location walking distance to the Louvre Champs Elysees and Musee D Orsay We would definitely stay there again 
43331,H tel Westminster, Bathroom door s lock has to be renewed Shame for technical personnel looks like nobody checking condition during routine inspection All rest things are good,No Positive
43332,H tel Westminster, Impossible to sleep Piping screams tin walls without soundproof and booking com customers get a room with a noisy lift next them even in deluxe room , Location breakfast WiFi and staff
43333,H tel Westminster, At Breakfast next table to us spilled some coffee after they left the staff changed the upper sheet for the table but the lover sheet was left dirty They put new sheet on top of the dirty one Saw new people seated at that table Disrespectful To get to your room you nee to take the elevator to get to it you need to go up a small uncomfortable stairs The elevator doors opens up to the directions of you standing on the stairs Danger of falling backwards on your back Paid for a room with marble floor was put in a room with carpet floor No toothpaste or comb in room , Location was the best Close to Metro Opera Big Bus Tours location Red Blue line and almost next to Opera house Breakfast was great cooked chanterelles with bacon and potato triangles omlet and a lot of fruits and plenty of options for cold dish Reception staff was pleasant and helpful I could buy stamps and leave mail at reception some hotels do not offer this even it is basic service Room had a great sewing kit 
43334,H tel Westminster, Rooms dont have kettle and tea available , Great location Old charm hotel with basic facilities Basic rooms to small for a family Opt for a bigger room But great staff and loved the maintainance of the old hotel charm 
43335,H tel Westminster, The rooms on the first floor are terrible Paper thin walls impossible to get a good nights sleep Noisy , Staff specifically Laura was amazing rooms on the 5th floor spectacular Couldn t have asked for a better location 
43336,H tel Westminster, Non applicable , The room was very comfortable clean and quiet The location was perfect for all that we needed sightseeing and shopping The staff were friendly and helpful I will be back 
43337,H tel Westminster, The Hotel is starting to get a little old but keeps the typical Paris feeling The elevator was the only problem besides the beds there was only one elevator and we had to wait a lot for the elevator to arrive to our floor in the morning very small and bad location of the elevator , Great staff very service minded Classy typical Paris style hotel we did not feel like tourist at all at this hotel It wasn t crowded like many other hotels and it gave us that Paris feeling we hoped for The location couldn t have been better just besides one of Paris nicest places La place de Vendome Quite street outside of the hotel The bed was very comfortable but it was a twin bed that was made as a double bed and we had to push the two beds together sometimes because they slipped apart while we slept making a gap between the two beds The breakfast was good We recommend having a Deluxe room as the standard rooms are small according to some of the guests we met there 
43338,H tel Westminster, Breakfast was underwhelming The Breakfast staff were over stretched and not very helpful I would have expected a much better service and much better food from a hotel of this kind and price Overall Breakfast was very disappointing We knew this was an expensive hotel but that was OK as it was our anniversary and the location suited us However the prices in the bar room service etc were extortionate After two days we stopped eating in the hotel and certainly had our drinks elsewhere 160 Euros for two sandwiches and a bottle of wine , The bed was wonderful The Bar Manager in the Duke bar was fantastic 
43339,H tel Westminster, At 7 euros the espresso at the bar was perhaps a little on the steep side , Genuinely impressive service a beautiful hotel and an excellent room Breakfast was delicious and the location is amazing 
43340,H tel Westminster, The eggs were often cold On the buffet but this was remedied by ordering an omelette , As a first time guest I was warmly welcomed and found the staff engaging and helpful The location was superb and the old world ambience made one feel at home My very comfortable suite made me feel like staying longer The buffet breakfast was in a lovely room with an impressive array of choices
43341,H tel Westminster, Lovely bathroom but shower not up to standard The bed was a bit hard needed a topper to the mattress or a new more comfortable mattress No tea making facility in room , The old fashioned grandeur the size of the suite and good value Location amazing Quiet room on 5th floor 
43342,H tel Westminster, We had to leave wanted to stay forever , Beautiful hotel in an excellent position to explore Paris We received an upgrade to an apartment which was utterly amazing Beautiful bedding toiletries lovely warm room everything was perfect Staff all very helpful and polite nothing was to much trouble Breakfast amazing 
43343,H tel Westminster,No Negative, I liked everything the convenient location on the beautiful rue de la Paix close to everything the elegant interior gourmet breakfast and most of all kindness of people working there 
43344,H tel Westminster, Paid in full for the room before the stay but still charged my card an addtl 200 euros for extras Not had this returned yet and I checked out yesterday , Excellent check in 
43345,H tel Westminster,No Negative, The hotel is situated in an elegant street full of upmarket jewellers and high end shops I booked a suite and upon arrival we were upgraded to an apartment D so elegant and spacious beyond my dreams breakfast was delicious and there were so many items to choose from Staff was impeccable metro Opera was just a few minutes away 
43346,H tel Westminster, Called for room service twice for tea They managed to bring two empty mugs and seemed perplexed by the idea that we were after tea in our mugs at 9 30pm Was ignored at the second time of asking for our tea Bath was dated and stained so stuck to shower , Got a cracking deal Well worth the money for the location which is right in the city center Breakfast was very nice but get there early as they ran out of certain foods around 9 30 Beautiful building however quite dated in places Friendly reception staff Lovely comfy bed and homely feel to the suite 
43347,H tel Westminster, Guest in ROOM 416 were very disturbed till 5 am due to very noisy bar down below Perhaps a warning to guests would have been wrlcomed, As th main guest and head of the Family group I was up graded to a Signature double Th main reason of our stay was my engagement to my Now fianc e So th free upgraded was a great surprise to her and I The staff were excellent breakfast bar r ception Baggagiste
43348,H tel Westminster, Fourth flooor Suite was in need of make over old and worn Kept awake by plumbing and noises from adjacent rooms and street very little sound proofing Pity and was probably worth the star rating 10 years ago but now many others out there are better and less expensive , Good location Room spacious Good breakfast choice 
43349,H tel Westminster,No Negative, The area that the hotel was in It allowed us to be able to walk everywhere we wanted to from the Arc De Triumph to Sacre Coeur and we are OAPs The reception staff were exceptional They went out of their way to solve any problems that we had and Nicholas was a total gem sending me to his own opticians when I had a problem with my glasses A bonus when it was only a couple of minutest away The deluxe superior room was recently refurbished quiet and extremely comfortable The bedding and towels were changed every day The hotel exceeded my expectations and I would certainly recommend it 
43350,H tel Westminster, dated decor breakfast service chaotic and breakfast not very enjoyable Room small and dingy , Good internet connection nice bathroom great location and fab spa area
43351,H tel Westminster, Could have supplied tea and coffee making facilities in the room , The suite we stayed in was perfect The staff were great and the ambiance was also perfect 
43352,H tel Westminster, I got a bigger room but some standard rooms my friends stayed in were very small and no room to open two suitcases even move around It s rather expensive even for a 4 hotel but I guess it s Paris and most such hotels are expensive , The location is fantastic Close to the metro and walking distance to many great places including shops and restaurants The concierge booked us a great restaurant the manager Katharina was very helpful with room arrangements when there were issues The hotel is a bit older but well maintained beautiful flower arrangements everywhere 
43353,H tel Westminster, The bath plug was broken and the bath itself was a little dirty however maintenance and housekeeping showed up almost instantly to fix problems The room was small and old but the city outside is too beautiful to stay inside so wasn t too much of a problem for just one night although longer than a two nights would have been extremely chlaustrophobic , The staff we absolutely perfect they couldnt have done better a credit to the hotel Location is brilliant and the spa facilities were included in the price of our room The breakfast choice is fab the bath tubs are massive and the hotel provides a little Paris map which is very sweet Toiletries provided 
43354,H tel Westminster, I feel we were given the smallest room because we booked with booking com i could almost carry on a conversation with the people next door the walls were so thin and we were opposite the lift no sleep at all No reduction offered, The staff were very helpful and charming The breakfast was very good
43355,H tel Westminster,No Negative, I researched numerous Paris hotels and chose Hotel Westminster because it looked traditional and lovely and was in a good location for us What we received was all that and much more Unexpectedly I needed something translated from German to English and the Concierge found someone in the hotel who helped me immediately and I got help I needed at the small business center off the lobby Also I left some possessions in the room after checking out and I received an email from the hotel before I realized that I had left them The price for on on line offering was at a deep discount so I did not expect to have one of the larger rooms pictured on their website but the bathroom was large which was helpful to us Our room was quiet although near the Place de L Opera I was amazed how many Paris hotels are advertised with photos of stark furnishings bathed in neon colored light If you share my aversion to that version of sleek you might appreciate Westminster as much as we did 
43356,H tel Westminster, The room was tired and needed a refit especially at this price bracket and rating A picture was missing from the wall which showed how dirty the wallpaper was as well as the darker lines where the wallpaper joined The bathroom door and frame had noticeable chips taken out of them and the bathroom sink drained very slowly , Slept well and the hotel is well placed and a classic with good service 
43357,H tel Westminster, For the price and Stars the hotel has you would expect better amenities in the room The pillows where not comfortable The shower did not have a shower curtain or door However it did have a small decorative curtain which was moldy , The location of the hotel is great Walking distance from the Opera bus to go to from the airport and many tourist attractions The staff was very friendly and helpful 
43358,H tel Westminster, The breakfast ends on 10 00 am on weekdays which is way too early I was not made aware of this and ended up missing the breakfast even though I had prepaid for it at the booking The staff at the restaurant made no attempt to compensate for this in any way , We were very impressed with our room and the old world charm of the hotel The location of the hotel nestled between Opera square and Place Vendome is a major plus 
43359,H tel Westminster,No Negative, Beautiful room stripped taffeta drapes that matched the wallpaper chairs upholstered in chenille upholstered armoire with tucked away mini frig comfortable bed with both soft and firm pillows antique writing table with matching nightstands and crystal chandelier hung above Bathroom was trimmed in marble super large and tall shower head with hand held sprayer and another sprayer for the large tub great lighting and also had a window that peered into the courtyard similar to the room When we first walked into the room the screen on the large TV read Welcome Ms my name and the channels were already set to English The concierge and all staff were friendly nice and upmost professional The hotel staff parked took care of my rented vehicle and brought it to the entrance when we departed helping with luggage Buffet breakfast was scrumptious Overall the hotel far exceeded my expectations 
43360,H tel Westminster, Nothing the hotel is perfect, Beautiful hotel beautiful location The hotel is old world charm and adds to the stay in a beautiful city like Paris It makes you feel like you e gone back to an age where service and sophistication were important it is old world service in a beautiful classic French setting Highly highly recommend it 
43361,H tel Westminster, It s old building but with good c p value and great stuff , We like the big space of suit You won t say it s a modern hotel but it has luxury deco room and perfect location 
43362,H tel Westminster, Hotel Bar was rather cluttered and overheated , Breakfast was excellent Convenient location in a very nice part of Paris Lots of cafes and bistros also mini supermarkets Walking distance to the Opera House Galleries Lafayette etc
43363,H tel Westminster, Room was a bit small , Staff were helpful when we checked in and checked out especially Carolina and all the concierge staff And a doorman who always smiled The meal at their restaurant was excellent and to top it all the staff there especially Alain Gerrad made our evening perfect with their hospitality 
43364,H tel Westminster,No Negative, 5th visit here and staff gets even friendlier and more helpful A great value and great location Bed and pillows very comfortable and Large bathrooms and I love the warm and cozy bar and lovely breakfast 
43365,H tel Westminster, I didn t dislike anything but I will say it is quite expensive but that is expected for the service , Our stay was utterly amazing The staff were lovely in particular Nico the consierge We will definitely be returning 
43366,H tel Westminster,No Negative, Hotel Westminster is a lovely old hotel with a classic French style about it The bedroom was welcoming and comfortable with a large bathroom It is perfectly located within walking distance to Jardins Tulliere The Louvre and Place de la Concorde There are a couple of Metro Stations within a few minutes walk but we used the bus a lot Only 2 minutes walk to the stop Extremely friendly staff and we would certainly stay again on another visit to Paris 
43367,H tel Westminster, The lift was a little outdated , The ambiance of the hotel was amazing Furnished beautifully Very friendly staff Best location for shopping very close to st honore and opera Very good breakfast 
43368,H tel Westminster,No Negative, Excellent hotel close to Galerie Lafayette and Vendome Room spacious and comfortable and good breakfast Staff friendly and helpful Would definitely stay there again 
43369,H tel Westminster,No Negative, Our room on the third floor overlooking the courtyard was perfect as we needed to rest as well as doing a lot of sightseeing It was quiet the bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom shower facilities were first class The staff were all extremely efficient helpful and friendly 
43370,H tel Westminster,No Negative, The location is excellent as well as the restaurant The newly refurbished suites are quite agreable with very nice bathrooms generous amenities 
43371,H tel Westminster, I got an excellent deal thanks to Booking The hotel is great but I find it a bit expensive without a deal Small reparations needed and better fitness equipements I understood that they ll begin a major rework to transform it in a 5 star hotel next year , Staff Service was great Good Value for money Excellent location next to the Op ra Quality Breakfast m nu the Honor Suite was spacious 45m awesome view of the inside courtyard The Hamman is really big the sauna OK 
43372,H tel Westminster, Chic but very business like neighborhood no nightlife whatsoever in the surrounding neighborhood Not much amenities and very small , The overall cleanliness of the hotel and the friendliness of the staff 
43373,H tel Westminster, The temperature of the water is continuously changing making it impossible to adjust the right temperature So when you take a shower you freeze or burn in cycles Although I ask the reception they couldn t solve the problem This is not acceptable at this class of a hotel I would also expect an espresso machine and an iron in the room The sports facilities are for show and has a very small space But I think few people care for them , The hotel is at a nice location The staff was very attentive The hotel is in an old building and nicely renovated We stayed in a suite room The decoration was fantastic There were marble chandeliers chimneys old vases english style wallpapers and chairs The bathroom was also spacey looking nice with double wash basins shower and bath tube Although we couldn t dine there the hotel restaurant Caledon and pub Duke s bar are highly recommended All in all it is a nice hotel with a very good ambiance except the water temperature issue 
43374,H tel Westminster, The electrics to the light switches were faulty I was not possible to turn on just one night light The T V relay in English did not work for either of the TV sets , The ambience and comfort of the suite were perfect The morning breakfast was very good 
43375,H tel Westminster, The bathrooms are a bit older I wouldn t say I didn t like it but a more modern bathroom tub shower would have been great, Location size of the room the sauna and fitness room The bar was nice and quiet if you like it that way 
43376,H tel Westminster, The hotel is old and in need of renovation The walls are thin and you can hear every noise from neighboring rooms and hallways Doors being slammed and people talking constantly can be heard The fixtures are old bathrooms are in dire need of update and repair , We liked the location and friendly staff 
43377,H tel Westminster, Hotel is old world and needs major update and renovations Furniture in our suite were from the 70 s and not to standard condition for a suite at 700 x night, Great location to be in Paris
43378,H tel Westminster,No Negative, Hotel Westminster is a reasonably priced stylish hotel right in the centre of Paris very close to L Opera and easily accessible to many of the best of Paris landmark locations There are some fabulous designer shops in the area too even if you only want to dream and window shop
43379,H tel Westminster,No Negative, I come to Paris very often and I have stayed in many hotels by far this is the best hotel I ve stayed at The location is in the heart of the city you cannot go wrong Make sure yo ask for a renovated room Best best stay 
43380,H tel Westminster, Rooms are getting a bit old with clear signs of use TV is not very responsive WiFi not always reliable , Good hotel overall in a great location Excellent staff Good breakfast 
43381,H tel Westminster, The lift is tiny slow and old fashioned The temperature of the shower difficult to regulate as this comes from a central boiler , Traditional old fashioned in a good way Parisian hotel Comfortable elegant and stylish Discretely attentive staff and good breakfasts Great location
43382,H tel Westminster, The smallness of the room The bed almost completely covered the floorspace so using the luggage racks was not really an option , The location was superb and the main reason we stayed there The reception staff and concierge were helpful especially when our key stopped working or we wanted travel guidance Cleaning was efficient and thorough 
43383,H tel Westminster, Hot food at breakfast not palatable the barely warm scrambled egg awful mushrooms in particular, The refurbished bedrooms are more expensive but worth it marbled bathroom was especially luxurious Housekeeping excellent clean towels twice a day fresh linen every day if you so wish 
43384,H tel Westminster, will not be back I spent around 1300 for 5 nights The room wasn t even worth a 3 I really wonder how this hotel can have 4 They still have those old tap in the bathroom with hot and cold water apart takes 10minutes to find right temperature because if the room next to you use water then it gets even worst I asked to change room because of it s condition the answer was we are working on improving the rooms next time we will give you one of those So the room rates is a rip off but then it gets even better at the bar where a beer 33cl cost 12 Finally the fitness room really usefull as i practice everyday I mention everyday because during my stay Sunday to friday the fitness room toilets included haven t been cleaned once really not Once no new toilet paper roll towels that people used mine included were we left them the following day Hygien 0, The staff was really friendly and the bar is beautiful
43385,H tel Westminster, The mushrooms in the breakfast buffet were not quite right That s the only thing , The hotel is lovely It is classic and stylish with modern amenities Not pretentious or stuffy and located within a two minute walk of Palace Garnier and the Opera metro Staff are very warm and helpful everyone was extremely nice Dukes bar is a nice piano bar with a 30 s feel Excellent gin and tonics and a great club sandwich We dined at Le Celadon the restaurant adjoining the hotel This is a superb dining room and definitely worth experiencing Some of the best food I have ever had the pleasure to try Rooms are period in style and very tasteful TV has stations in French German Italian and English plus Saudi and other Arabic stations The bathroom is spacious and very clean The bed was king sized firm but very comfortable We will definitely stay at the Westminster again 
43386,H tel Westminster, Checking in to what could be described as a broom cupboard that hadn t been cleaned but give them their credit they moved it straight away to a much better room no problems, Location
43387,H tel Westminster, Hotel rooms need to be renovered Because room and bathroom conditions quite old , Hotel staff all they are friendly and helpful Mr Nicolas from concierge was excellent 
43388,H tel Westminster, Other people staying at the hotel were rude to the staff , The staff at this hotel were exceptional In all my years of travelling I have never come across reception staff so friendly welcoming and helpful Special thanks to Laura for special hints and tips on places to go We certainly will be back due to the first class accommodation and service we received 
43389,H tel Westminster, Nothing , The Hotel is excellently located for all the sights most being within walking distance The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful Nothing was too much trouble 
43390,H tel Westminster, The bedroom which was advertised as superior was in the roof cramped and with an unpleasant smell A bar charge of 30 for a tomato juice and a gin and tonic , The location The friendly and helpful reception staff

43399,H tel Westminster, The rooms are very basic false sense when you walk into the very lavish entrance hall Shower tempremental hot and cold through whole time Bar is very expensive , The reception of the hotel and the location is excellent Less than half an hour from Eurostar and hotel is a 2 min walk from metro

43411,H tel Westminster, Night receptionist was horrible We were put in an apparently upgraded room only to find 2 twin beds that pulled apart when I sat in the middle I fell Went to complain that we had asked for a double bed And even if twin beds were the only availability I was worried one of us would fall when turning while asleep The beds had wheels that just rolled away The confrontation was horrible The man was rude and insisted they could not do anything about it and that we had arrived late and all rooms were taken I was enraged because when booking with booking com we had indicated that we would arrive late Avoid room 512 unless they have changed the beds After a long argument they apparently found an available alternative room for us The following morning we spoke to the guest relations officer Caroline Hubert who was polite and professional , The location 
43412,H tel Westminster, The nice entrance was a facade the room was expensive It was small the furniture was old The lock on the room door had previously been broken and there was broken wood the bathroom did not have a separate shower but was attached to the bath overall the room was very disappointing and not what we expected from a 4 star hotel The food was very expensive and we did not eat breakfast there for that reason , The hotel was in a good location in central Paris near the Opera house the hotel had a nice entrance it had a little bar with a very nice barman but drinks very expensive The staff were friendly

43424,H tel Westminster, Mix up with allocation of rooms on arrival Restaurant extremely understaffed on Sunday 27th September which led to a shortage of crockery and a lengthy delay for food The senior member of staff in the restaurant was very harassed and snappy with customers , The hotel was ideally located for numerous restaurants bars quality shopping Paris Opera House and transport There is a taxi bay immediately outside the hotel which was very convenient 
43425,H tel Westminster, They failed to tell us that the automated phone wake up system was non functioning which was not apparent when setting it This almost caused us to miss our flight but luckily one of us happened to spontaneously awaken We stayed there twice and both times we were required to wait until after 3pm to occupy our room no attempt on their part to make it ready earlier check out time was 11am The cable TV English stations were non functioning throughout one two day stay , Great location
