137571,L Hotel Pergol se Paris,No Negative, Hotel staff was really nice and helpful My check inn was till 3PM I arrive earlier then expected But the front desk help me to hold my luggage She was really nice to send it upstairs when my room was ready for check inn She gave me a map and guide me where to take the transportation restaurant and more That was a plus without asking 
137572,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Did not like that we could not use it he same key for both rooms in our family apartment The doors do not stay open and lock automatically making checking on the children and communicating between our rooms difficult Elevators are very small and slow , I liked having a separate room for the kids The beds were comfortable The staff was excellent very accommodating Rooms very clean 
137573,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Small elevator as I recall a couple of steps up TO the elevator If the staff hadn t offered to lug my bags up gratis I would have been very unhappy with that arriving at the end of a long travel day , This friendly little hotel is perfectly located on a side street a short walk from the Argentine metro stop Wonderful staff were very helpful with a few unexpected travelling woes dead US phone a bag left in a taxi translating talking to relevant parties on phone for me I m fine face to face but with unfamiliar situations by phone I was travelling with my 17 yr old granddaughter we both really liked it In addition to the easy Metro access it s in a nice neighborhood with a great patisserie around the corner delicious Italian ice at the chocolate shop 2 doors down nearby caf s easy walk to a number of restaurants the Champs Elys es I would absolutely book there again 
137574,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Lift can only fit 4 and is a bit slow The rooms are all odd angles and obviously made to fit around an existing structure Bath in our room had an oddly placed shower head forcing you to stand in the narrowest part of the bathtub where the taps for the bathtub protrude , A very pleasant hotel quite conveniently located for the Palais de Congres convention centre but maybe a little less ideal to see the major tourist sights of Paris There was a nearby Metro and the Arc de Triomphe area was an easy walk The front staff were very happy to call for taxis The front staff were very nice and helpful particularly Ms Dolma Mr Andre and Mr Cyril Wifi was good although you have to validate all devices every day Nearby boucherie boulanger and cafes very good 
137575,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Nothing it really was quite nice, Had two rooms behind one door to make for an apartment Large rooms for Paris Quiet Modern and big sized bathrooms Not far from Metro good restaurants nearby Staff friendly Fridge and kettle in room 
137576,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, The aircon was broken and they refuse to fix or change room for us One of the waiter at reception desk was response slowly with very bad service attitude ,No Positive
137577,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, I was surprised at how tired the room was style and furniture was dated though paint etc was relatively fresh Bathroom very dated and tired Considering the rack rate and positive reviews I did expect something better Ceilings were fairly thin too It sounded to me like someone was opening and closing drawers upstaires constantly from 5am I would say this is probably the poorest of the the 8 or so different hotels I have tried in Paris , A cheap price for a reasonable location 
137578,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Tea bags and coffee are not refilled on the second day Considering everything personally I think it is more like a 3 star instead of 4 but overall it is still a good stay , The location is good and safe 5 mins walking distance to Argentine metro station very close to Arc de Triomphe and Avenue Champs Elysees Also there are quite some cafes and bars around convenient 
137579,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Everything But the staff truly are fantastic , Fantastic Hotel I count ask for more Polite staff and modern clean rooms I look forward to staying again M Johnson
137580,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Pillows are too thick We left the room at 9 30AM and came back to the hotel at 3 45PM When we came back the room wasn t cleaned nor the bathroom , Great location

137582,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, We were very disappointed that after our flight we couldn t check in at 14 00 so we waited up to 15 00 Terrible smell of toilet in the elevator , Location is great All taxi drivers know the hotel

137584,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Is an old building so the rooms desperetly need some renovation as well as a better cleaning It will be also great to renovate the bed linen by having for example a real duvet, Friendly staff Calm 
137585,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, The bed was too hard uncomfortable mattress blanket we couldn t sleep properly , The staff was very friendly and helpful the room was spacious and good value for money Great location and easy to get around 
137586,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Very old and uncomfortably room and bathroom Uncomfortable mattress blanket instead of commonly used white Duvet Not very good isolation on the 6th floor rooftop and no adjustable heating or air conditioning , Excelent location On a calm street 10 mins walking distance from the arc de Triomphe champs Elys es and airport buses Etoile Porte Maillot Very nice and attentive staff Exent detail of having an adroid for guests to use during the stay The android has wifi useful apps inc google maps and free calls for selected countries Guests can carry it around the city and charge it on the room Good value for money 
137587,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Room is a bit cold coz heater is cold at night no toothpaste and not enough shower gel somehow , Supreme room upgraded to deluxe spacious with slanting ceiling it s the best part of it
137588,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, The weather unfortunately did not allow my usual walking trips, Its a wholesome experience on a historic street surrounded by multiple icons that gives you a time travel experience of a lifetime

137591,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, The only minor improvement which could ve been made is the cost of breakfast I know that it is generally a pretty average cost within hotels but we found it much nicer and cheaper to go to the Patisserie across the road each morning for fresh Pain au chocolat and crossaints , Warm and cozy rooms while conditions outside were freezing The staff were very friendly and spoke perfect English Facilities in the room were excellent with a huge TV coffee capsule machine and even your own smartphone which was available to use completely free of charge This handy device allows travelers unlimited internet whilst out and about and provides information and recommendations on hundreds of things to do Paris The best part was the ability to use google maps when we got lost wandering the streets The absolute highlight of the hotel was the location Personally the Arc de Triomphe is my favourite icon of Paris From the hotel you turn right and walk 100m turn right again and straight ahead you ve got a fantastic close up view of the Arc Further a stroll to the Champs Elyeese is less than 5 minutes if you re excited We had a fantastic couple of nights at le pergolese 
137592,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, I asked for roses on bed they put fake flower petals They should mention on their website that the rose petals are not real , Location is good value for money Friendly english speaking front desk Tidy rooms

137595,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Bathroom a little tired in need of some TLC , The hotel position is perfect it you like less crowds opposite side of the Arc de Triumph nice bars and restaurant with great Metro links Bed amazing
137596,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Apart from having somebody bringing your luggage into your room I didn t see any difference with a 3 star hotel It was great to have a kettle in the room but the choice of tea coffee was very reduced either basic black tea or instant coffee not great when you are off caffeine The bathroom was very dated with damaged walls in the shower area I am glad I had a discount as I would have be disappointed to have to pay full price , staff comfortable bed and location
137597,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Nothing, Perfect location Metro station right next to hotel Convinient for city sight seeing Bakery and super market next to hotel The hotel was nice renovated and clean The stuff was polite Thank you for the great stay I recommend this hotel Keep up with good work 
137598,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, blankets not sufficient for a change in weather conditions 4 stars may be bit too fetched but iam not familiar with paris standards so that is not solid statement, location is fantastic 
137599,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, charged 19eur for buffet breakfast even in the reservation was stated 9eur in general hotel interior looks a bit dated but that is what you often get in 3 4star hotels in the centre of Paris, Perfect location in the walking distance of porte maillot and arch de triomphe room was silent despite the close location of a big street also room size was sufficient 
137600,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, I am not impressed with the breakfast I was working so wanted to eat before I went out but at 9 for the formule express when the coffee is so awful and the croissants are in short supply is not great At 19 the buffet breakfast was beyond the pale And the WiFi was poor to abysmal , The staff were extra helpful and the room was big by Parisian standards They had also given us a free upgrade which was a great surprise

137603,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Value for money neutral purely as Brexit made it over 200 more expensive than when I originally booked it , 2 rooms connecting with one primary lockable entrance to both rooms was great for my teenage daughters to stay together with us knowing they were safe Location was great just a short walk to the Arc de Triomphe
137604,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, The closest train stations didn t really get me anywhere I wanted to go so I had to connect Not a big deal but a waste of time I d rather stay closer to a train stop that has lots of options ,No Positive

137610,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Breakfast is too expensive almost 20 euros per person , The hotel s location is excellent near Arc du Triomphe and Champs Elys es There s a metro station 2 minutes away which is also very nice as well as all sorts of places to eat or have a coffee All in all it s a good value for the money It s a nice clean comfortable place The room was quiet tastefully decorated and with a good size for a couple The wi fi worked perfectly for both of us 
137611,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Not like a 4 star hotel Lobby is shabby looking Shower is leaky Refrigerator was warm Breakfast is way overpriced Must not want a lot of takers , There was an attempt at being like a high end hotel Close to the Arc Soft bed Even a c

137618,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, First night i arrived in the evening and even i booked and i asked to have a room with a big bed the person who was at the reception in night shift gave me a room with to single beds connected it was not comfy at all not very kind from the guy Of course ithe hotel could be full but it wasn t the case because i stimulated a booking and the hotel still have available rooms The next day the girls all of them were very kind and helpful and they immediately changed for me the room Thank you girls Other thing for a 4 stars hotel Nothing was offered in the room no water and no coffee I had to pay one capsule of nespresso used in the room I found this very cheap , The location and also the team in day shift The Asian and the two French girls 
137619,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Rooms very small and not representing 4 star status Comparatively expensive and not value for money The hotel forcefully charged 25 euro per day for Child although our child is never been a crib sleeper and it was compulsory to hire which was not stated while booking and the most important the room service didn t make up over room and on demand they said the hotel will charge you for making up the room in France its is like this , NOTHING ONLY TENSION

137622,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, The air conditioning in the room was very ineffective and the room was very stuffy The breakfast was very overpriced for what was offered The hot buffet was tiny It was not possible to order something There was a very limited selection of snacks for room service and no meal as such , Nice room with comfortable bed and spacious ensuite Staff were very friendly and helpful Very good location 
137623,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, A bit pricey LATE room service is not worth the expense most items of the menu were not available microwaved canned food small quantities very average quality So i would recommend to check the time if you need to use room service so that you can benefit their external cattering service not tested and avoid using the late room service as much as possible , Great location short walking distance to Porte Maillot and Place de l Etoile Easy to go everywhere including to airports count about 1 hour from and to airports Room larger than average for Paris Spotless cleanliness Comfortable bed Comfortable slippers Instant coffee tea available Choice between two breakfast options full buffet breakfast including fresh warm crepes and fresh fruit juice not an extensive choice but everything of very good quality or express continental cheaper and available in room if you wish Internet was stable 
137624,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Room on the 6th which in itself is OK but standing up in the bathroom for a good shower was impossible because of the low roof Next time will ask for a room on lower floor , Nice hotel very good spot Not too expensive Good choice for a stay in Paris 
137625,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, We had requested a check out of 2pm that way finish the marathon walk back shower taxi to airport One of us made it back on time but had to vacate and check out for 2 pm The other one of us had a difficult day on the marathon and didn t make it back to 2 20 pm Taxi was booked for 3pm so there was plenty of time for a shower Having requested a shower the charge was 30 euro Somewhat excessive particularly when it was back in the room we had vacated and they hadn t even started nor looked to be starting to clean it We intend going back to Paris next year to compete in Marathon again Would consider this hotel if there was perhaps some flexilbility with showering after the event , Very Comfortable room very handy to Champs Elysee We were there for the Paris Marathon Location was ideal for both the start and the finish 
137626,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, The room needs to be updated The decor is a little outdated The amenities in the bathroom were lacking considering the price of the room , The location was ideal for my needs The bed was large and comfy 
137627,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, There was a problem with the heating and initially my room was very hot The staff was reasonably quick to fix it though , The hotel is very confortable and the rooms are large for Paris Coffee and tea is conveniently provided Good selection of international news papers 
137628,L Hotel Pergol se Paris,No Negative, Hotel was good for value we didn t eat in the hotel Metro station near by Room were clean had a bath and shower combined We stayed in a standard room so the picture didn t look like the ones advertised Probably would stay again for the price we got it View was of a shared alley way not to pleasant but we didn t spend time in the room
137629,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, bathrooms are definately not at 4 standards old and faulty Room was smelling like smoke when checked in , internet connection works well good location 
137630,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, The Hotel does not have a lot of common space at reception and the bar is more of a quiet space to have an evening drink after a long day exploring if you are looking for a lively on site venue this is not it however there are plenty of cafes restaurants and other venues within 1 min from the door step of the hotel so this should not be considered a problem , The reception staff especially Evelyn who made evening meal reservations for us on our first night there were very helpful and friendly Breakfast was very nice The hotel is located 5 min walk from the Arc D Triomphe and start of the Champs Elysees and the metro station Argentine is practically outside If you are flying Ryanair to Beauvais this is a perfect location as the bus to the airport is 5 min walk from the Hotel 
137631,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, The hotel is clean and cared for but I think it got its 4 stars a while ago and some areas such as the bathrooms could do with up dating and where the carpets have been replaced on the stairs you can see the edges of the carpet rather than them being finished off I had a problem when checking in due to my credit card having been replaced 1 month before While a resolution was found it meant I had to have a refund then pay again for the room This led to E40 unnecessary bank charges as my passport was evidence I was the same person as the credit card This all became far too much of an issue which was a shame as it impacted my view of the hotel That said I would definitely go back when I go to Paris next year, Super location close to Arc De Triomphe and 5 min easy walk to metro on lines which give very good links throughout the City Also some nice bakeries and shops around Room was a very good size and well cleaned If the mini bar had worked I would have said it had everything I needed The staff were friendly and helpful while dealing with every day matters When a problem arose the manager did not deal with it that well and the receptionist did not seem to know what to do Once the problem was dealt with the receptionist returned to friendly and polite The manager was OK ish
137632,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, 1 expensive for us but everything was great , 1 staff were very friendly 2 convenient to visit main museums 3 nice bakery store is closed to the hotel 4 safe area
137633,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, The rooms are poorly designed the elevator is too small Also the bathrooms are very unpleasant , The location of the property is impressive near one of the most famous attractions in Paris
137634,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Lights in room were faulty and the air con was too hot and did not work when trying to turn it down, Perfect Location tasty breakfast and incredibly nice staff
137635,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Staff specially the receptionist Miss Dolma is amazing and really professional in being rude and providing assistance to its customer the property is rather very much into making money other than putting customer s satisfaction as their priority for assistance I did call boooking com 24 7 hotline but there is no one to assist during night your call be go on waiting for next one hour my main concern has been with booking com then the property directly let me tell you I have been very very active booking com customer but am really disappointed with them ,No Positive
137636,L Hotel Pergol se Paris,No Negative, Very nice big and comfortable room a home away from home in the best Paris area just next to l Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees Avenue The fantastic staff made our stay even more enjoyable A place to remember and come again

137640,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, The hotel is beyond the zenith of its time The room we had would need some renovation works particularly in the bath room the tiles are starting to become lose The corridors are very narrow and at the time we stayed at the hotel the lift required some repair At arrival we found on a wood covered wall an imprint of what appeared to be the freshly creamed bottom of a previous guest Although we requested to have it cleaned this didn t happen , Very friendly staff the hotel was located close to Metro exit Argentine 2 minutes walk to Arc d Triomphe We had a welcome bar with some coffee and biscuits on arrival later we retrieved some sweets with our key which was nice The room was overall clean At this price the hotel was very good 
137641,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, breakfast choice is very nice but expensive 18 eur and I was not informed by teh receptionist about the express breakfast option which is a set of muesli juice croissants etc for 9 eur This would have been perfect for me as I didn t eat much anyway after paying 18 eur , everything was nice
137642,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, It was really hot in the room and I could not find a way to turn the AC on Room could do with a good refresh, Good price Very comortable bed Good breakfast Quick wifi conection Nice TV in the room

137644,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, The hotel looks very worn and tired am unclear how it managed a 4 star rating It is also very noisy in the rooms at night due to traffic whizzing up and down the main road that is close by I was on the top floor 6th there is no sound proofing This is a functional hotel no more Good location for work close by with a super boulangerie around the corner Great staff For the rest pretty dreadful for the money, The staff were super helpful ordering taxis organising for a late check out iron Very professional
137645,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, The breakfast was good but a bit expensive , This hotel is well located for anyone coming from Beauvais Airport as the bus terminal is only 3 or 4 mins walk away and its only a few mins walk to the Arc De Triomphe The room is big and clean and has a safe the staff were friendly 
137646,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, The room was quite small and ordinary the bathroom had seen its best days , Excellent breakfast Great and tasty selection of french delicacies The hotel is conveniently located close to Porte Maillot Bois de Boulogne and the Congress center The quality of the bed was good All in all the room was quiet providing a good night s sleep There are some very good restaurants in the same and neighbouring streets like the Italian resto in rue Malakoff and Bistro Obourpif almost next door 
137647,L Hotel Pergol se Paris, Everything at this hotel is in disrepair in need of restoration 3 star at most no bathrobe dirty towels street noise not a good deal at all , Location The big bed
