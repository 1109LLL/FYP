185705,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, First room offered didn t have a bath as per our booking It was next to the entrance and very noisy both from traffic and from the receptionist talking on the phone The second was up 2 flights of stairs but there are no lifts in the building Breakfast was great but there was the danger of being run over while crossing a busy road getting to it There is no restaurant or bar on the premises Fire safety was great galvanised sprinkler pipes run throughout the building suspended from the ceiling in full view In a 4 star hotel I would expect to see only the nozzles placed discreetly through the ceiling Two of the spindles on the stairs to our room were broken presenting a safety hazard to small children , This visit was to celebrate our wedding anniversary The staff laid out a rose petal love heart on our bed for the occasion The room was not as we booked and when we asked for one as per booking we were upgraded to a club room Our bags were carried up for us as there are no lifts Breakfast was great with a good choice of menu items and the staff in the restaurant were very polite and helpful 
185706,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Everything is Ok I will recommend this hotel to my friends It s in a quite neighborhood Very good location , The location is prime The room is comfortable but the bathroom is too small maybe because we have big bathroom in our country 
185707,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, There was no lift and my room was at the very top floor The fact that there was no lift was not clear when I was making the booking Also I was told at the time of booking that my card would not be charged prior to my arrival but when I arrived at the hotel it had already been charged This was an inconvenience Also when I made the reservation it stated that breakfast was not included so I made other arrangements whilst when I arrived at the hotel I was told by the staff that breakfast was included For me that was the third inconsistency that I would have preferred not to encounter I told the staff that they needed to ensure Booking was aware of these but they told me that I had to take this up with Booking myself , The location was excellent The room was tiny but clean 
185708,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, The shower was excellent but took a little bit of working out Not really a negative though , Great breakfast choice and glad it was included in the price otherwise it is quite expensive The staff were excellent throughout We had booked to stay in the Shaftesbury Suites but were upgraded to the sister Marble Arch Hotel Montcalm just up the road Room was on the lower ground floor and was the quietest room we have ever stayed in in London Would definitely consider staying again 
185709,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, The only problem is the lack of a lift but there is a porter on hand to help carry your luggage up , The receptionist noted that my birthday was coming up at the weekend When I went to breakfast next morning full English was very good I was presented with pancakes with Happy Birthday written in chocolate which was totally unexpected I can t fault the level of customer service 
185710,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Small room Not inherently a problem and likely to be expected in pricey crowded London , Shaftesbury Suites is a very short walk from Marble Arch and Hyde Park It s in an absolutely lovely West End neighborhood with lots of amenities and a 15 minute tube ride to the Square Mile heart of London downtown The rooms are nice if small The staff is friendly and very helpful 
185711,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Unfortunately although the food at breakfast was good service was a bit muddled i e we had to wait a long time for the tea and then we had to ask for cups , Staff very pleasant and helpful and excellent location 
185712,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch,No Negative, The staff is genuinely nice and kind I felt welcome and in general it was a lovely experience I enjoyed my time in London and surroundings Be careful and book immediately a larger room instead of the single room since the rooms are not very spacious 
185713,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch,No Negative, Efficient service from Ana when system had doubled booked a lot of rooms She organised taxi transport to sister hotel and a complimentary room upgrade
185714,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Breakfast took too long to be prepared waited more than 15 mins one of the waitress she was pregnant to specify who she is was miserable no smile no tact approach customer with no smile was a burden to do the extra mile to please also has to change hotel to use hotel facilities after a nice sauna and swim one has to cross the road to go to ones room Breakfast is too expensive for what we have consumed When ones pays a package as expensive as we did breakfast should be free without any charge , Easy access to my business meetings clean hotel comfortable great shower fruits in room etc
185715,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, No elevator breakfast is soo limited staff has a very large gap of communication to the extent that they asked me 3 times for payment of rooms Lack in pipes of toilets resulted in a floor full of water day and night , Location room spaces
185716,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Had to go few doors down for breakfast arrived room had to change as fan outside constant noise very loud you could not read sleep or hear tv was changed to smaller room less facilities no bath so very dissapointed as 4 day stay i think could have made sure room ok or moved To similar staff came check was noisy did best they could , Good location 
185717,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Nothing, Massive room great breakfast no lift but only on 3rd floor 54 steps added to my Fitbit Staff are very helpful and the room had proper windows That opened 
185718,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Bedding for a baby cot There was a baby box but no pillow or proper bedding for child Otherwise everything was great , Location is just few munites from Marble Arch You can walk to shopping street easily Free upgrade to a club room and the room was clean and had almost everything in it including microwave The staffs were very nice and friendly as well 
185719,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, This not a four star hotel at all the room is normal there no elevator the room are not sound proof the shower was leaking for a very very long time after using it and many other things Overall this not a four star hotel and doesn t worth the value When a I visit the city I found out many hotels around the property with the same value or very letter more but it s very much better than Shaftesbury suites, The staff were good and some of them were helpful
185720,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Small room Hidden entrance Went to the address on booking and notice hotel entrance was actually 1 block away The lock on our door was not functioning well got locked out for awhile after a long shopping day Breakfast Staffs were not helpful at all We asked for two sunny side up eggs and wait 20 mins still not ready We need to catch the flight so we left without the breakfast We asked two staffs if our food is ready neither of them care Poor expreince, Location
185721,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, I didn t get the two extra hours of late check out for being a genius member , The staff was really friendly The location was awesome just a minute or 2 from oxford street and the marble arch Breakfast was really good and great wifi connection I would definately book again 
185722,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Breakfast taken at sister hotel as it s a small boutique hotel was a little noisy on staircase as other guests coming and going outside door , Comfy bed great location Free upgrade was a bonus 
185723,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch,No Negative, Fresh fruit and complimentary water in the bedroom a short walk to Hyde park for a run plus a powerful shower made this hotel stay perfect for overcoming jet lag The staff were very friendly and helpful and the location is convenient for business restaurants site seeing and shopping the hotel is a short walk from Oxford Street 
185724,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, I found check in was different to others having to go to the sister hotel to checkin then back again to room , Location of hotel was great and the room was spacious We used this hotel because of the price and was not let down
185725,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Room was too small and expectations were nothing like the pictures , The location was amazing if you are planning on shopping in Central London The room was clean but so small Also Croissants were amazing D
185726,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, The prices for simple snacks such as chocolate bars and peanuts that were 6 each , Room bed and facilities were great Slept wonderfully nice and quiet in a quaint town style house 
185727,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, I recall the hotel information saying there was no lift only 3 floors when said done but the stairs are tricky if you do not have full mobility and that should be a little more prominent However the staff did help with our luggage without being asked and that was a great help Also breakfast is taken at a sister property approx 100 yards up the street which needs to be highlighted we were lucky in that it was cold but clear when it s raining it could be problematic Are umbrellas provided in that circumstance may be a nice touch , Good location for Marble Arch and the variety of public transport links to get around the sites and the West End 
185728,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Pity the hotel doesn t have a lift , The room was very spacious and the shower very comfortable and nicely warm The breakfast was very good especially the freshly baked croissants The staff were very helpful
185729,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch,No Negative, Fantastic service from every single member of staff they were all lovely and friendly and attentive to our every need The breakfast was delicious and the complimentary spa was just what we needed at the end of our shopping trip Definitely stay here again thank you 
185730,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Very small so even a double room couldn t have two seat places The stairs from downstairs were heavy The hotel is definitly to be recomended but ask for a room on the ground floor , Fantastic location and a modern room very good equiped The staff was fantastic 
185731,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, anyone going up or down the stairs the noise was very loud into our room because of the old building structure Breakfast was served in a sister hotel a 2 minutes walk away so wasnt the best option in the freezing morning , spacious room good location great staff
185732,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, The breakfast area could be better and the space available utilized better The actual breakfast selection considering the star rating of this property was poor Staff were helpful and tried to please , We were upgraded to the property at 31 Great Cumberland Place Room was excellent and bed very comfy Location is excellent Staff at reception were very efficient 
185733,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, They were having some staffing problems at breakfast inexperienced staff , Great location comfortable rooms very clean all is there what you d need We had a street view room but the street is so quiet that we slept with the window wide open Breakfast is very good a buffet an order of choice from the menu 
185734,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Breakfast is served at their sister hotel about 1 min down the road Room safe broken power plug seems yo have been removed , Small and compact but clean and sufficient 
185735,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, The worst room we ve ever stayed in 271 a night for an attic room on the 6th floor with no lift This wasn t a suite it was a broom cupboard Central London with only single glazed windows therefore traffic noise kept us awake throughout the night Very disappointing and misrepresented by the image and details on website Requested earlier check in which hadn t been communicated ,No Positive
185736,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Breakfast room in different hotel Not a problem in it self but staff here was a bit stressed out not enough tables so we had to wait to be seated for breakfast , Good location room was good size friendly staff 
185737,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, how they can rate it as a 4 star hotel no gym no bar a tiny reception and no restaurant and the rate is very high in compare with other real 4 stars hotel , the stuff
185738,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, With valid booking they did not have any room so that upgraded Us to Montcalm 31 great cumberland street which is not 5 stars but 2 stars max Room907 with window to internal corridor only noisy and you cannot open the door as it is blocked by the bed Room 904 you cannot see 1 3 of the tv from the bed as it isbehind the wall so why such a big tv Room 906 the ventilator in the bathroon did not work all 4 days so it was difficult and uncomfortable for use In none of the 3 rooms safes worked for 2 days and all of them were removeable as these were not connected to anything Finally they repaired two of them but then batteries finished in both of them and had to be repaired again problem was that we were waiting for our computers for more than 3 hours as the pre prepared push buttons on the phone did not work but there was no info that you should push 0 instead and you do not expect that as it worked in the third room room 906 So Montcalm is very bad experience They reported to have problems with our credit card but the bank confirmed in writing that they even did not try as there is not any evidence in the bank, Apples at the reception and Czech and Slovak receptionists
185739,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, No one mentioned you had to walk up the road for Breakfast , very nice room mentioned it was our Anniversary and got a complimentary bottle of wine Swan towels on the bed nice little touch

185747,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Tiniest of rooms I had booked a single room but didn t expect it to be so small and cramped Expected better even in London for 200 plus , Good breakfast but had to go to the sister hotel along the street for it Free wi if 
185748,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, The photos on Booking com were misleading We wanted a room with a living area sofa etc so I choose the Deluxe room which in the pictures showed this So paid and checked in then taken to a much smaller room and was told it was a Deluxe room it is the Club rooms that have the Sofas etc , Rooms were spotless modern and to a high standard 
185749,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, The staff didn t seem to know what they were doing got the room keys muddled up both in the evening and the next day , Rooms were clean and comfortable good location have stayed in better hotels in London however when we booked this this hotel came up as one of the most reasonable in terms of price The room was very quiet as this hotel is off the main street

185760,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Although we had checked the day before and everything was OK When we arrived Saturday we were told the rooms were double booked and the receptionist was uninterested in our problem The next 9 approx couples that arrived were all told the same The Manager wanted to ship us to a hotel the other side of London Only the fact they had debited my card the day before got them to put us in a sister hotel down the road The room was tiny By the time all this was sorted we missed the first 90mins of our concert I wouldn t be surprised if our original rooms were given to a wedding party at their neighbouring hotel , Not a lot See next comment

185765,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, They put us in a different hotel without the facilities we had booked and expected Never got beyond reception so cannot review Shaftsbury Suites They moved us without giving us an option a supposed upgrade We had booked a club room with a kitchenette as we wanted to do picnics so seemed the perfect solution for our needs The room we were given in different hotel was basic and fridge didn t even work When we told them we weren t happy with accommodation and wanted room in hotel we had booked they had already filled with other people and we were stuck with what we got , The location was good as we were there for events in Hyde Park 
185766,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Bigger rooms Suite is a bit far fetched Our room was more like a small double room , Location right next to Marble Arch Oxford Street Edgeware Road

185772,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, The full English breakfast was average not the best we ve had in a hotel of this calibre but there was a nice selection of Continental items , The hotel is in a good location close to Marble Arch and Hyde Park The room we had was bigger than normal with a lovely very comfortable king size bed We did have to go to their sister hotel further down the street for breakfast but this wasn t an issue as it was a nice stroll 
185773,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Searched for romantic hotels on Booking com but didn t find the hotel as romantic as on the photos Also there was no information about the separate entrance , The breakfast
185774,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, The short walk to breakfast Not really a problem in good weather , The location was very close to Marble Arch making it an ideal spot to view much of what London has to offer The breakfast was plentiful shame you had to go to a different site to have it

185777,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, The breakfast was poor It was bad not only in selection but also in the quality Plus I had to walk 10 doors down to get breakfast but that isn t much of a problem problem was the lack of space as well , Only the location 
185778,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, just be aware that the hotel has no lift and you have to go to the sister hotel if you are having breakfast, bed very comfortable room very clean great location staff very good and breakfast very good
185779,Shaftesbury Suites London Marble Arch, Didn t state that breakfast is at sister hotel up the road but it s only 50yds and on the same side so not a big deal , Very large comfortable bed smart modern bathroom with huge bath sitting area facilities to make a snack
