277091,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Cleanliness will have to improve , Very good breakfast fresh orange juice and nice coffee 29th was my bday the hotel surprised me with a bottle of cava That really made me feel happy 
277092,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Reception charged 4 nights for parking instead of 2 and when we noticed the mistake the lady wasn t even sorry for this An apology would be appreciated , Excellent price performance ratio for Barcelona 
277093,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Not a lot erm no actually there was nothing we didn t like , It s just a really up to date hotel friendly staff towels bedding cleaning happened every day it was just a pleasure to be there 
277094,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, I found a chewing gum in the window shades That is really disgusting and disappointing Almost 200 a night just to find an old chewing gum in the room I couldn t look at it anymore i could not believe that room service did not noticed it I have also noticed that the room lacks soom privacy it tall buildings next to it it is easy to see through the big windows unless you put the blackout all the way down Also had to wait 1 hour for room cleaning I have also found a roll of duct tape under the bed Really This hotel has all it takes to be an amazing hotel but it fails in the smallest details , Good location and fresh and new design and style 
277095,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Remaining hair in the bath tub ruined everything , Not in the very center but just 5 min walking distance to the subway and 10 min to most attractions New building with large windows nice room No 1 we liked is the delicious apples at the reception The room was clean except one problem 
277096,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Poor location need to take the train to go anywhere as there is nothing around Staff could be friendlier Pool a bit unusable as in the middle of the bar area , Rooms spacious and comfortable Close to a metro line Rooftop bar with nice view 
277097,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, I didn t like the fact we wasn t made aware of maintenance work going on in the rooms opposite ours which had me awake on my very first morning early However they made up for it by upgrading our room to an executive suite for the rest of our stay , The hotel was AMAZING staff were super friendly and very helpful and the location for me was just perfect 
277098,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Staff was a bit rude Pool is very small Beds were two separate beds moved together and the middle hurted back we had chosen one big bed from the options while making the booking , Good breakfast 
277099,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The staff could have been a bit friendlier the bed wasn t that comfortable and parts of the room looked a bit tired and in need of fixing telephone wire broken mould round the bath broken blind etc , Modern hotel loved the rooftop pool and cleaners did a great job of the room everyday 5 minute walk to the Metro and tram which was extremely easy to use and navigate Overall very good value for money really enjoyed our time in Barcelona 
277100,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, There were problems with the room keys on the 9th floor which was a minor inconvenience, The staff accommodated our request for twin beds and were helpful when taxis and metro went on strike Location was a few metro stops from historic center and in between major sites sagrada familia and park guell accessible by bus 
277101,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, TV did not work small table lamp was broken and even the sharp pieces of bulb were inside hanging The hotel staff is annoying for checking so many times the room We opened the door and let it be open for them to not knock so much This is one of the hotels where you feel that after paying a lot of money nobody cares , The hotel is right next to shopping center Rooftop area is cool 
277102,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, I hated that the cleaning staff walked in without knocking they did it every day woke me up one day interrupted a bath another day b That was really awful , The staff was excellent friendly helpful informative 
277103,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Room was scruffy tatty and dated Nothing like pictures online air con didn t work bathroom light didn t work maides staff where walking in room without even knocking on the door first bed is like laying on a concrete slab Blood and stains all over the carpet in the room ,No Positive
277104,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, A few very small complaints After checking in and getting into the room twice a staff member tried to enter the room and the knock on the door was so quick you had no chance to shout anything out One knock and the door was open Then of course they were all very apologetic after they realised someone was already in Not ideal when you are getting changed in your room after a flight , Standard 4 star hotel in Barcelona friendly staff members Nice roof terrace and bar even though the pool is tiny Great location on the Diagonal for Primavera festival 
277105,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Looks run down I stayed at Silken in 2011 and having returned 6 years later i was disappointed in the maintenance of the building our rooms and hallways looked tired and run down Room service ended at 11pm we landed at midnight and slept hungry as no places to eat, Good location
277106,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, I paid more to have a room with a nice view but I got a room on the 1st floor with a terrible view on the Novotel hotel The receptionists were not very helpfull when I had a problem to contact our friends next door by phone finally I gave up TV only spanish channels room tidy but with no wow effect , I really like the location of the hotel the turistic bus stop was just next to the hotel The area is nice and safety 
277107,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Could definitely do with updating the televisions at the hotel Watch out for street crime Far too many pickpockets and opportunist thieves in Barcelona Such a shame , Good hotel Location is OK but there s not really any good bars restaurants nearby New shopping mall opening across the road which might change this Good links to main tourist areas Overall very happy with our Barcelona weekend Lovely atmosphere in the evenings 
277108,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, No privacy in shower Weird fabric sliding door that offered no privacy when sharing a room with a friend Opaque glass would be better Staff slow in replenishing breakfast food Beds a bit uncomfortable , Upgraded on arrival Extra space and seating area was good Good selection of food at breakfast 
277109,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Don t bother getting the breakfast if you re staying on the weekend We went at different times on both the Saturday and Sunday and both days juice glasses and food ran out without being refilled or checked They also ran out of tables at one point During the week breakfast was fine and kept on top of We were quoted a taxi price of 35 Euros to get from the hotel back to the airport by the staff member who booked our taxi when infact it was 50 just for having three pieces of luggage There weren t as many sun loungers as we thought so we couldn t relax on the roof Not very many traditional food places to eat nearby , View from the roof was really nice We got upgraded for free and had a view of the cathedral which was incredible however I dread to think what a smaller room would have been like for the money Close to the metro station which we found very easy to use and the cheapest method of transport Close to a very good modern art museum which was free on the Sunday 
277110,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Housekeeping was too diligent changing towels and replacing soap daily Cold ventilation in the restaurant bar area Pool far smaller then expected Location bit off the centre , The room was great and offered a nice view The breakfast was good and rich Well accessible though by tourist bus and metro 
277111,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Roof top bar was closed whilst we was there but wasn t informed before hand as that was the selling point for us on booking the hotel Extreme noise on the windowsills when it rained kept us awake as very loud sounds like a silly complaint but was extremely noisy, Rooms in hotel very modern and clean nice location and staff really helpfull Breakfast excellent Fab hotel
277112,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Wanted a room facing Sagrada Familia sadly that wasn t possible Bathroom was small , One of the best showers ever Staff were very friendly and helpful Especially Alan at reception 
277113,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Internet connection is awful Bathroom is a joke too small and you have no privacy Nice view but they charge you more for skyscraper view for a single cucumber like building this ain t worth a coin, Nice view but they charge you more for skyscraper view for a single cucumber like building this ain t worth a coin
277114,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Breakfast is bit expensive for 18 euro per person you can find pretty decent breakfast nearby The room was bit cold but the kind staff provided extra blanket , Location is great the view from the room was fantastic Near the hotel you can find metro train bus and tram stations Try the roof top terrace and the amazing panorama of Barcelona Staff was very kind and helpful The room was cosy the glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom give an extra fascinating touch 
277115,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, poor ventilation in bathroom no complimentary bottled water superior room that not facing tore agbar didn t have the expected view, great location classy design very clean friendly staff
277116,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, We stayed in March and room was a bit cold , It was modern and beautiful hotel with big rooms and good facilities The breakfast was very rich and the staff were friendly and helpful Hotel is near metro station and shopping center 
277117,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Bit of a shame the pool area on the roof only opens in May when the weather was lovely in April Will definitely go back during summer months next time , The room was lovely and very clean Staff were really helpful too Really close to the tube station too which can take you everywhere with 10 trips for 10 
277118,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Nothing , It was honestly the most beautiful and luxurious hotel we have ever stayed in we would like to thank all the staff as they were so helpful and even upgraded us to a suite free of charge The rooms were absolutely beautiful
277119,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The glass walls in the bathroom but it wouldnt put me off staying again, Jesus on reception was really friendly helpful Beautiful aroma in the reception The room was lovely with quirky decor in the hall 
277120,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Very smal TV in the room It would be nice also to have at least 1 Russian channel like www 1tv com hotels on tv for example , Modern design of hotel nice restaurant and food The service is on very high level We were also very impressed to get support from Rusian receiptionist Olga She is quite helpful and very polite Cleaning staff is very good Everybody is very friendly We would definitely come back to this hotel again
277121,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Would have been nice if the rooftop bar was open but not sure if that s only used for functions , The beds were extra comfy the shower was powerful could see Sagrada Familia from the room beautiful view of the city from the rooftop and we were upgraded to a suite 
277122,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, My friend and I staggered out showers as there was a clear glass wall but it was a dream stay other than that, Beds were larger than normal in Spain and the rooftop is a dream Wonderful views of the Barcelona skyline Super handy to access just get the metro line 1 to Glories and it s behind the gherkin Got a free upgrade too 
277123,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Problem with noise environment you can hear almost everything The menu of restaurant is not very various Some of furniture and room environment need improvements , Very comfortable beds Metro Glories 4 stops to Pl Catalunya trams and buses Close to Glories Centre Good wifi Very tasty restaurant try steak beef 
277124,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The room was a bit cold and we could not warm it , The staff were very helpful breakfast was so rich very modern hotel Near metro station and shopping center 
277125,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The Pool was too small for so much People But we didnt use it We dont have any other things we didnt like , The bed was Really big and comfortable We had an awesome view from The Panorama windows in Our Room The view on The Rooftop at The evening was amazing Across The Street is a Shoppingcenter with some Shops for clothing Food and Restaurants Bus Tram and underground Train Are just around The corner At The Hotel Reception we Booked Tickets for The sightseeing and a church The Hotel was Really Great and we would book it definitly again 
277126,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The beds could be a bit more comfy , Amazing location close to public transport and walking distance to Sagrada Familia very nice and helpful staff good quality breakfast very clean hotel window blinds if you enjoy sleeping in a dark room local shops around and a new shopping centre nice and quiet area appeared to be safe too 
277127,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, No privacy from toilet Can see through if someone showers Not suitable for double occupancy No tissue paper in the room Pillows too soft Mattress too soft Wall too thin because I could hear my neighbors talking , Nice croissant Like the black out blinds 
277128,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, No tea or coffee in room only one small bottle of water between two and the clear glass cubicle is less desirable whe sharing a room with family shower constantly flooded the bathroom floor, Nice rooms good location great shower
277129,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The bed is not good is keep mooving and you need something there for humidity is very dry into the room Even if we can open the air conditioner is not enough , The staff and food was great but the bed the room so many sounds from i don t know were we couldn t sleep at all in three nights i will never come back to stay here 
277130,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona,No Negative, Rooms were exceptionally clean and the views from the roof top are amazing Only 10 minutes away from the centre on the metro which is 2 a trip Would defiantly recommend for people who want a nice hotel just outside the centre 
277131,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Devil is in the details I think that responsible person should paid a bit more attention to details on the condition of the details in the rooms Some scratches on the walls or furniture or the toilet door which is very difficult to close but more difficult to open room 905 Or not so clean upholstery of some chairs in the lobby Those small not SO important things for the first sight are changing very good first impression , Very good location nice modern design very quiet clean 10 minutes walking distance from Sagrada de Familia and if you like walking so you may go everywhere by pie We were going to Rambla and back just enjoying the weather and city sights Good parking place Very pleasant and nice stuff 
277132,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Nothing , Staff were absolutely incredible could not have helped us more Great location minutes walk from glories station upgraded us to a suite for free Views were unreal if the city from our room and the rooftop views are breath taking We will certainly be returning 
277133,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Everything fine as usual If I may say just one thing beds were not the best comfort but anyway totally ok , I am a frequent business traveler It was my second time here and I think that it was a great choice Nice building Convenient location Great staff Cool rooms with super view I was lucky enough to see Sagrada Familia from my window Terrace is always magnifique even if it was raining the most of the time Great value for money Among the best in town I ll be back 
277134,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, We found significant signs of usage and deterioration TV was not working properly The innerspring mattress was painful and not applicable to people with back problems Breakfast buffet was good but coffee was awful We tried to call the front desk for some questions It was not possible and we ended up in a call center , Stylisch and modern Hotel good connections via Metro Tram and Bus We booked a suite with reasonable space and great view 
277135,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Bathroom has transparent glass walls think twice before you share the room with a partner who isn t your spouse , Modern clean comfortable peaceful close to public transportation 
277136,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona,No Negative, Usually I m placing a regular positiv or not opinions This time this hotel for sure deserves to get 11 out of 10 points Perfect staff kind and professional Clean all over Iron to my room within 1min Taxi ordered day before to the airport already waiting for me downstairs Invoice this is the best part for the 1st time without any remarks all details applies properly at first time Bravo And thank you 
277137,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Nothing, Very modern hotel and in close proximity to public transportation tram metro and bus Great location and lots of variety for breakfast Love this place 
277138,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, My Room was in need of some TLC The Blind on the window had been repaired Floor tiles had moved a bit to expose floor beneath Wood furniture was quite badly scratched and wires were exposed in certain areas of the room, Good location for town and CCIB Very slick front to hotel Reasonable breakfast and great shower 
277139,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Requested room facing Torre Agbar but didn t get it even though booked in August and it was for the third time stayed with Silken apart from this all was perfect , Good location near metro fantastic hotel decor good staff nice food Glories shopping centre cross the road which has different restaurants Carrefour supermarket cinemas
277140,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, No 24 hour room service , Good location if you need to be in Glories area Nice understated stylishness for the rooms and lobby areas Breakfast was good and dinner was okay as well 
277141,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The facilities are so cheap I really was shocked T the quality of everything in the hotel plus the staff could afford to put a smile on their faces while dealing with people they weren t rude or anything they just Do Not Smile AT ALL it makes a lot of difference just saying , The location
277142,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, While the hotel was lovely it lacked a kettle in the room which I found slightly odd for a hotel The other downside was the breakfast Whilst the booking states breakfast included this was actually only the hotel providing 3 towards the cost of your breakfast and the only thing this covered fully was a fruit salad everything else on the breakfast menu was either 4 or 5 if I remember correctly , Room was very nice big and clean The hotel itself is in a prime location with the tour bus route picking up from across the street there s a new shopping centre village in the process of being built but has gone quite a few finished units with plenty of places to eat There s also a big carrefour in this shopping village which is ideal for buying the odd bits and bobs you need if you ve forgotten anything The metro which is very very easy to use is only a short walk from the hotel too and makes for easy and quick access to las ramblas etc 
277143,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, If you don t book breakfast as part of your room rate it is an expensive 18 euros there are good local places nearby where you can get breakfast for 6 euros ,No Positive
277144,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, There was reconstruction on the Street some roads were closed Therefore taxi from airport had to drive in a long way Room was relativelty small It was expensive than its real value Neither close to congress center nor to city center However tram station was very close Metro station is 5 min walk ,No Positive
277145,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Small pool bathroom shower bath see through Not good if you are with family or a friend Only good for couples , Comfortable bed automatic blinds
277146,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, While the rooftop area was amazing there were a few occasions that it was occupied by private functions which made it slightly less accessible As hotel customers we were still able to use the area during these times but it was very busy and noisy , Excellent service at the hotel friendly staff and beautiful rooms to match a great location within walking distance from the main attractions and beach The rooftop pool and bar were excellent a great place to spend the day relaxing and amazing views with sun on the roof for most of the day Exactly what we wanted from a city centre hotel 
277147,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona,No Negative, The hotel was well positioned for our visit to see our friends in Poblenou The parking was difficult to find suggest giving information and directions during booking Our room was upgraded to a club suite which was great Unfortunately the shower and bath both leaked when using Otherwise a very pleasant stay Great view from the rooftop pool bar 
277148,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Pool was small and location a bit outside the center but taxi is cheap and bus stops and metro close to hotel , Breakfast was superb Nice rooms and trendy lobby 
277149,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The fact that the rooftop terrace bar pool are not always accessible to guests on 2 of the 3 evenings we were there we could not use it in the evening because of private events , The staff were knowledgeable and friendly The views from the higher floors were good Easy access for the Tour Bus Metro station and the Glories shopping restaurants
277150,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The price is slightly high when comparing with another hotel The Internet access was quite slow , It was comfortable to connect the metro Easy to access the tram and subways In front of the hotel was closed to the nice department store such as Zara shop and Carful 
277151,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The personnel was so rude Especially the guy who is called Martin at reception was terrible The room was not clean the pool on the roof is like a joke The bed and the pillows were so bad that we couldnt even have a good night sleep Even the wifi connection was not working properly Trust me this hotel only counts on its location but nothing else You can find thousands different hotels in Barcelona that are close to metro stations as this poor hotel , Nothing 
277152,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, nothing, Fabulous breakfast and the first class attention of the staff Great location minutes from the beach and the transport to the city centre was done in a few minutes All in all could not be better 
277153,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Pool was Dirty room was Dirty only 1 towel in room but i was with my daughter in the room Upgrade to junior room when i booked i wanted separated beds employees not really friendly taxis in this City is Long waiting times , The Pool on top of the Hotel location is ok not too far from City center 
277154,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The staff move very slow U ask for a drink and it takes about 20mins to make a simple drink not a complex cocktail a shot and mixer I found that shocking Also they didn t provide us with the two beds we requested on our booking months before arriving We asked them to change but refused and became quite rude and advised its just a request Not acceptable for 4 grown to share beds at a hotel with this star rating breakfast was not included in the cost of this booking we paid 1150 for 2 rooms , the rooftop was kool
277155,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Small rooftop pool , The smell in the hotel was very nice The room very clean Good position right next to Glories metro station Good luggage service Very good breakfast with fresh fruits and variety for special diets like no sugar or no gluten Everything very professional 
277156,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The shower was hard to use as the whole bathroom kept getting wet the breakfast was not included and the mattresses were a bit hard , the location was good as it was well linked up for public transport and the beach 
277157,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The pool it is the size of a hot tub One of the main reasons we chose this hotel is the pool especially for the time of year we were there It was tiny tiny can only fit a few people standing up And it s strange because the roof top is big lots of wasted space Soundproofing We could hear people next door when they went to pee And with electric curtains in front of windows that makes a lot of noise you could hear all the people living around you when they took them up and down no matter what time of day or night And drink people talking normal voice in hallway was also easy to hear Bed I m 192 but normally not a problem Here I would sleep with part of legs outside since bed so short And it was very very hard For me that was ok but my wife hated it Breakfast Generally good but no vegetables Only tomatoes it s so strange not to be able to eat vegetables for breakfast But pastry with sugar on they had lots of English other then the reception not many understood it Tv shouldn t matter much on holiday I know but other then some spanish and German channels not much to watch Was one English if but stopped working I mentioned it and got told they couldn t fix they got tv signals from outside company I could talk to them That just made med speechless Wifi I have never had such bad wifi in my life It almost never worked especially in room And so slow Like with the tv they told me I could call the internet company myself to fix I m a computer engineer with 15 years dealing with networks I know when the problem is unit or Infrastructure , Staff in reception was nice and friendly Location is nice Close to metro and tram Breakfast minus almost no vegetables 
277158,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Nothing in particular that we didn t dislike , Room was very good with a modern facilities and a comfortable bed Close to transport and to suburban shopping centre eating facilities 
277159,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, didn t like the glass walls in Bathroom not private enough Bed too hard Rooftop pool too small , Very clean and modern Fantastic views from rooftop terrace 
277160,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, That you could see into the bathroom and could not get a private shower This was not ideal with a group of girls going away who were not comfortable with this , The terrace area was fantastic with great views of the city and was so quiet up there The staff were very friendly especially Rishad 
277161,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Lack of advance warning of rooftop pool area s use for a ticketed event on the Sunday Bass pounding through the ceiling and no access to the pool area from 1 30pm 9pm , Breakfast was delicious and staff were friendly Rooms very clean and comfortable 
277162,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The roof top bar was the best part of the hotel you could see across Barcelona it was a nice place to sit in the day and evening , The room was amazing loads of room and very clean The only downside was one of the plugs was coming loose from the wall but in all it was a pleasant stay 
277163,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The customer service was not to a 4 star standard During our stay we had two leaks in the bathroom and this was dealt with poorly by staff at the hotel They attempted to brush it off on both occasions and didn t take my complaint seriously We also found someone s clothing in our room The restaurant is also over priced and the food is not especially good , The overall design of the hotel was good Great views from roof and houskeeping services were very good 
277164,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The room was clean but falling apart my beside table was broken as was 2 cupboard doors The feature wall behind the bed head was made of sheet metal and was not attached the wall properly so every movement on the bed would make a loud noise on the wall The TV was very small and had a terrible signal on all channels, Very well known place easy for the taxi drivers room service pool and rooftop bar
277165,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, What tipped me to stay here was the pool 11 yr old boy Unfortunately the pool s a bit smaller than expected if it wasn t so cold I d call it a huge hot tub and closes pretty early 7pm or 8pm There s not much in the vicinity restaurants etc and it s not really convenient for walking to the sights , Very interesting and stylish hotel at times form trumps function not my preference but still very cool very Barcelona The staff were friendly and professional and the room was nice and clean The roof bar pool area is spectacular Public transportation is convenient Probably a bit better suited to the business traveller Price is fair 
277166,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, the hotel had 12 irons with over what i must assume to be over 800 rooms life malfunctions resolting in 15 20 min wait Delays no sense of privacy in rooms with glass bathrooms and a see through slider one pillow supplied,No Positive
277167,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, We didn t like the glass bathroom The toilet door didn t close properly you can hear everything in the room No privacy in toilet and bathroom ,No Positive
277168,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The whole point of me choosing to pay the extra for this hotel was for the rooftop pool area Unfortunately it was hired out for events and we weren t allowed to use it unless we bought tickets A small refund or compensation wouldn t of gone a miss, Pleasant hotel
277169,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The swimming pool was laughably small I ve seen bigger baths Rooms rather pokey No peep hole in door security risk When we arrived 3 pieces of electrical fittings were broken but fixed immediately when we alerted reception Carpet in corridor was cheap thin and dirty Glass door walls around bathroom are downright dangerous we walked into them several times each day far too trendy for an area that needs to be functional Room had not been properly dusted Grouting in bathroom tiles was dirty, Breakfast was good Location ws good
277170,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Really uncomfortable bed seriously really really bad sleep The bathroom smelt awful and the water smelt of sewage The carpets and fittings were stained and shabby The staff were dismissive and unfriendly Noisy corridors and you can hear the automated blinds in neighbouring rooms The terrace was over crowded the swimming pool is tiny and the bar tapas was not very good quality Even the hairdryer was crap , Not much
277171,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Shower leaked onto the floor, Great location for the Primavera festival and close to Metro and Tram Places to eat nearby Lovely roof bar and pool Felt very classy Got upgraded to a superior room
277172,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The weather That of course is not the fault of the hotel It seems every time we go to Barcelona It rains and for that reason the rooftop bar which we were looking forward to enjoying was not open Well I guess will have to take another chance and go back again , Our corner suite with a view of the Agbar building Just as promised Very comfortable and a shower to die for 
277173,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The airco didn t work and at the time there were works outside the hotel so whole the room was shaking with the ground works but that s just bad luck of course But far away from the center maybe but metro station at the entrance so very well connected , Was nice to receive an upgrade The suite was nicely equipped although the airco didn t do it after our evening activity the room was like an oven Also the tubes of the bathroom were not guiding the water away so taking a shower was like a pool not to speak of the hottub Personnel was really nice and accommodating and the breakfast was yummy but very expensive 18 per person 
277174,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, I would like to inform all the future guests whom will be staying in the same hotel that my mum s bag was stolen in the reception while she was doing the check out The bag was right next to her and the receptionist was trying to distrust her by telling her that she ordered coffee to the room Logically the receptionist are right in front of her so if anyone passed by or took her bag they would have seen it or at least the security whom observing everyone who is entering and exiting the hotel main gate However the manager also was not very helpful and did not want to open the cameras and see if it was someone in the hotel or not he said he would have done it only with police report he didn t even try to call them for her as the case did not matter to him this much The bag was brand name of Burberry with iPhone6s Versace sunglasses and ferragamo wallet with good number of money with all the credit cards and IDs I would like to understand if this is not the hotel responsibility then who does ,No Positive
277175,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Unable to buy a coffee in the evenings in the hotel Confirmation for late check out not available till the day even though emailed in advance , A lovely modern hotel with a quick lift The staff were friendly 2 mins to metro Glorias which is 4 stops away from La Rambla Catalunya this is reflected in the price 
277176,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Pool could have been warmer Twin beds pushed so close together not everyone who travels together is a couple , The cafe next door to the hotel not associated with the hotel for an authentic Spanish start to the day Hotel was clean and safe 
277177,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Bed was hard location for a pre cruise is to remote from the port, Clean modern rooms large by Euro standards The breakfast buffet was amazing Hands down one of the best I ve ever seen anywhere for variety and quality 
277178,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, location was not very central however metro is right around the cornor, The Staff were so accommodating we were a large group and they made dinner reservations for us and would always make a transport arrangements The hotel staff were 5 star all the way nothing was too much for them 
277179,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, There was no complimentary tea coffee kettle in the room which I thought would have been standard for any hotel The beds were very hard and were only provided with one pillow each The tv worked but was very grainy so ended up turning it off anyway The blinds are automatic and you can open and close them by a switch next to the bed but unfortunately the noise of other people s blinds opening and closing was very loud and woke us up every morning , The rooms are very minimal but clean and comfy for a 3 night stay 
277180,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The housekeeper opened the door at 8am Just like that I guess to check if were in I didn t understand that , I did late check in and allowed me to do late check out 2pm That made a difference The receptionist working at night was of great help 
277181,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Room attendants walked in twice without knocking or anything My wife and I were on our honeymoon so obviously not ideal Otherwise highly recommended ,No Positive
277182,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The beds are quite firm so if you don t like that it could be an issue , The hotel is absolutely lovely staff were friendly and helpful perfect area 
277183,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Bathroom tower was used and wet but hung in the bathroom which was very uncomfortable Water bottle in the fridge was opened and 3 4 of it gone Cleanliness and housekeeping wasn t so keen on checking the fridge and also replacing the towels , Hotel decoration and design is very nice and modern I had a nice view towards a tower and there is a water kettle in the room for tea and coffee which was nice Staff were friendly
277184,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Staff weren t interested We had booked a suite as a celebration for my husband s 30th and I d asked if they could arrange something special in advance offering to pay of course but as a surprise nothing was done The rooftop terrace which was a major selling point in the hotel was closed this should have been made clear at the point of booking as we would have changed location Instead there was a note stuck inside the lift Very impersonal and not a four star experience , Nice modern building very central
277185,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Location is a bit far away from the centre and the beach However it s just 2 4 stops from centre and beach port by subway We walked there from the centre and it took less than half an hour , Breakfast was perfect with variety of eggs sausages cheese hams croissants cakes fruits etc They had champagne as well Room was big clean and comfortable with an interesting bathroom with glass walls Staff was friendly and helpful We didn t try swimming pool or spa We d stay again 
277186,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, WiFi was VERY POOR Couldn t handle streaming at all The TV was a bit small not a big issue as you don t really go on holiday to watch TV Pool was shut for maintenance during our stay unavoidable but ultimately a bit disappointing , The staff were REALLY friendly and helpful The room was nice and modern with floor to ceiling windows Everything felt comfortable and easy to navigate Although we didn t eat in the restaurant we heard other guests saying great things about it Location was good for exploring all corners of the city as it was fairly close to La Sagrada Familia so quite central but a bit far from the gothic district el born etc if you plan on walking everywhere we had inline skates Also very close to a large shopping centre and bus rail stations As others have mentioned smelt really nice too 
277187,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, We had booked the hotel for 3 nights but only stayed for one We could not sleep almost all night because of the loud noise that is apparently caused by the the rain It really sounds more like somebody is banging pots and pans together We were offered ear plugs for rest of the stay but booked another hotel instead ,No Positive
277188,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Unappealing dining and bar facilities we did not eat any meals in the hotel and the one drink was expensive and not up to usual Spanish generosity standards The odd bathroom arrangements with glass division between bed area and bathroom the toilet was separate , Good location excellent secure parking Lots of restaurants and bars and breakfast places within walking distance Helpful staff 
277189,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Wifi doesn t work at all breakfast very basic bed was awful and uncomfortable it has pillows glued to the head board we had to get a spare quilt out and use that as a extra pillow No ironing board or iron Could hear through the walls of other people coughing Tele was very small one English Channel No bedside draws Air con didn t work it was SO hot Window wouldn t stay open and was next to a building site so was too loud open No apple juice or English sausages at breakfast or Nutella just small things , Nice shower very modern Friendly staff Toothbrush and toothpaste provided but only one when they re is two people staying Right by a metro station and market and tram Zara McDonald s pull and bear literally over the road Blind is on a switch which is pretty cool Maids came everyday 
277190,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The location is great as you are right next to a metro station however it would have been nice to have been more central Also I requested an ironing board on the first night of our stay but they took it away on the second day when I still needed it I found this quite odd as I have never had this when staying at a different hotel Hardly the worst thing in the world to happen though , They upgraded our room I thought that was mega 
277191,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Old equipment broken lamps in room blinking not repaired damaged lamp near bed repaired after my intervention old furniture shower construcion in bathroom was incorrect water dripping everywhere on the floor Furnishing like from old 3 hotel Very noisy curtains mechanism could be heared at night from the neighbours , Panoramic windows with 2 curtains fully glass window between bathroom and room Generally clean Not very bad kingsize bed 
277192,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, ongoing construction work directly in front of the hotel March 2016 interior needs to be replaced soon Tipp skip the Hotel breakfast for 18 and visit one of the coffee shop locations around the corner, nice location subway and tram directly at the hotel 2 big shopping Mall within 10 minutes
277193,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, No coffee or milk in the room , We decided to pay for the suite Definitely worth it as it was amazing Location was excellent would def recommend using the metro one station was 100 yards from the station which was handy Would definitely stay there again 
277194,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The view obviously out of your control but our view was scaffholding would ve been nicer to maybe be higher or facing a different way either the sheets or shower gel gave me and my honey really dry skin no coffee in the room only tea bar on the roof would ve been nice in the evening even in the spring a few finishes in the room e g curtains were ripped a panel in the bathroom was hanging off and the wardrobe had panels loose , bed was lovely staff were helpful especially Lika on the bar room was luxurios shower and bath great was close to metro
277195,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The price for the breakfast is too high for a 4 stars hotel 18 euros It should be included in the room price The food variety is very low The heat was not very high there were almost 20 23 degrees in the room even if we put the air conditional to 35 degrees nonstop , The position of the Hotel perfect It s very near to the metro station and to the sea aprox 15 minutes walk Also very near to some good restaurants to eat your breakfast The room was daily cleaned and we ve received sweets That was very nice and friendly

277201,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The hairdryer was difficult to use but at least there was one Lighting in the room wasn t great which made getting ready a bit difficult but nothing major View of a building site from the room and associated noise from this but this isn t the hotels fault , Great location to hop onto the metro Staff were accommodating and quick to respond when we asked for an extra pillow there is only one each Very clean and tidy hotel Toiletries of all kinds provided Quick check in and check out process 
277202,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Too hard to communicate with the housekeeping and the operator they only speak spanish there cleaning level is poor to normal Please improve this side It is really hard to ask from them what we need The blue lightning in the floor between the rooms were awful, The receptionist were excellent they speak English The smell of the place beautiful Rishad best employee ever There is one shopping mall near to this facility 
277203,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Pay attention in the food it must be fresh terrible Caesar salad the bread desserts baked in the same day thinking in 4 hotel Food 2 poor breakfast, Location 
277204,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, in 2016 a suite should have a bluetooth soundsystem and not a CD player who listens to CDs this days Busy area construction work outside but soundproof windows got that coverd Rooftop pool is a size of a bathtub but its was closed for public anyway , We had a suite for Valentines day weekend its was big and comfortable Cool place nice design and view having the Torre Agbar right outside I always recommend my firends to stay in the area between Marina and Glories Breakfast was the best Iv had in Bcn and I have stayd at 7 other hotels in that area

277206,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Booked a suite with spa bath and found this not working after 2 of 6 day stay told it could not be remedied Offered similar suite on lower floor which denied me from any discount as I did not want to move The toaster in the breakfast room required a piece of bread to go through it 3 times before being lightly toasted , Lovely suite with great view Huge comfortable bed with linen changed frequently Very good buffet breakfast included with good choice of cooked and continental Would certainly stay here again Very modern and wonderful location close to trams buses and underground 
277207,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The wifi tends to get disconnected from time to time The staff were very friendly and helpful but they d open the entrance door without asking sometimes The only window without a curtain was weirdly enough the bathroom window We had to turn off the lights when using it at night , The big windows gave a very nice view of Barcelona

277223,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The internet was extremely poor and annoying most the time it did not work in the room and we had to go to the lobby There was no water coffee tea water boiler in the room You may expect that a 4 star hotel leaves a water boiler and coffee in the room , location was great View of the room was good Staff were friendly

277236,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Internet connection was slow and through kubi The rooftop bar was closed most of the time The images were taken from good angles in reality the hotel is less impressive , The location is great close to the metro Price value ratio is fair 
277237,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The first room we were given was a twin on floor 3 when we had specifically requested a double room on a higher floor The room also smelt very strongly of faeces as soon as we walked in but the staff were quick to apologise and give us a new room The pool would have been nice to use but it is TINY Much smaller than it looks on photos , Rooftop bar was lovely of an evening especially with the DJ and his choice of music The location was great for getting around by public transport and staff were helpful and friendly

277244,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, I was very disappointed and regretted I did not booked for other hotel as my second choice were Marriot hotel by the sea The actual hotel room was unfortunately far different from what were being shown in the picture In real in my personal opinion the room is a 2 star hotel and the amenities were pouring And the cleanliness of the room was poor Oily service dust in the corner Everyday after having a shower the water came out and got wet everywhere Please be noted I have already pay for a more premium room the space is bigger and have a sitting area I took my parents for holiday to Spain as it was their 45 years anniversary the quality of the hotel brings down the whole experience Very disappointed Will not recommended to anyone Rather due to the central location I would have chosen Novotel which is next door and in a much better condition , The only thing I like was the staff were very friendly and helpful at the reception and some staff in the restaurant serving breakfast 
277245,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, The bed was too hard The pool area at the top was closed for 2 days because of a party but we chose this hotel because it had a pool area and I wanted to enjoy the sun during the day so we were really unhappy with that and thought we deserved a discount since no one let us know the pool would be closed for 2 days we found out when we got to the top The staff could have told us when we checked in Also the meal replacement for the hot food was not good we sometimes had to wait when it was finished for them to cook more eggs , The bathroom was nice and the view Everything about the room was nice except the bed and the tv was small and old with no hdmi The breakfast was good and had a lot of chose The staff was nice 
277246,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, If I book and pay for the hotel with the pool and terrazza at the rooftop I am going to use it And finding out that it is not available because of the private party there is quite disappointing Also I was not able to check in from 11 00 till 15 00m because there system was not working Wow And the view from the window to the construction works in the exciting at all , Location is good only if you care about quick getting to the beach 15 min walk 
277247,The Gates Diagonal Barcelona, Party on the roof That was terrible We stayed in the room on the 7th floor have 2 more floors above if i m not mistaken and during the weekend nights were sleepless Sound proof is awful you will hear all the noisy drunk neighbors walking through the corridor and located next to you room , I liked the staff even though some of them were too slowly others were super professional Helpful nice staff Location is great u can reach Sagrada Familia beaches Historical center easily Loved to walk during the stay Brekfasts were great Veriety of choces cereals eggs jamon sausages cheese fruits vegies juice pastry coffe even vine lots of food I have more likes than dislikes
