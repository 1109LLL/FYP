231863,Hotel Cafe Royal, Nothing, Everything it doesn t get much better in a city Beautiful building in a great location with high quality furnishings and the breakfast top notch
231864,Hotel Cafe Royal, fishy smell in the lobby usually in lunch time, staff was so kind with us i love everything there start of decoration clean classy and perfect place in London 
231865,Hotel Cafe Royal, The room is very modern The lights were all touch based and a little confusing to use The bathroom s water closet and shower were very small I preferred taking a shower in the spa on the first floor , The hotel had a great location It was clean and the staff was very courteous We had a great included breakfast each morning On our last morning we had to leave prior to the restaurant opening and room service was included for breakfast The spa pool and steam room was amazing 
231866,Hotel Cafe Royal, I found all the wood panelling in the hallways overpowering and whilst we deliberately booked a room with Portland stone finish we were upgraded to what was essentially a smaller attic room again with the over powering wood panelling and slopes to one wall because of the roof Got moved to what was supposed to be not so good a room but in actual fact was a much nicer one with Portland stone type finishes The first one was smaller and wasted a lot of space with the hallway and bathroom The second one struck just the right balance in terms of layout I also dislike service charge being added automatically and it was 12 5 , Breakfast was good Didn t care for the first room we were offered but the second we were allocated was first class Concierge staff and porters were most helpful The food was good but expensive 
231867,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, An absolutely exceptional hotel with the most professional staff that we have encountered anywhere in the world An absolute pleasure to stay in this excellent hotel 
231868,Hotel Cafe Royal, Our morning paper was forgotten which was not a big deal Staff were overall attentive at times waking us earlier than expected to check if we would like our room cleaned , The rooms are beautiful they think of everything Room services are impeccable including getting the blinds closed for you in the evening before you come back leaving little gifts and preparing the bathroom 
231869,Hotel Cafe Royal, Weird service charges only a couple of quid why It wasn t a problem really but weird , Staff very good We especially enjoyed what I took to be the head waiter big guy with a beard in the green room Took a lot of care and knew how to be friendly without sitting down and chatting Everyone was good though 
231870,Hotel Cafe Royal, I thought I have obtained Genius status and so I was expecting that I could do an early check in but in the end I could only checked in at 3pm Also it must have been the bed that I had the worst 3 nights sleep in London I had better sleep in The Wellesley where I was before travelling to Cafe Royal I didn t like the pastries and cappucino at breakfast too The cappucino at Harrods tasted better The pastries were not fluffy Though I have chosen to stay at Cafe Royal again after just 6 months since my last visit it s really the locality that brought me back Poor value for money though , The location
231871,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, Room size is perfect and spacious Bathroom and room are so clean Staff was so nice and helpful Felt like home away from home Great experience 
231872,Hotel Cafe Royal, The staff were too accommodating in that they were always there asking you if you wanted anything I felt like I needed some time and space to relax , The hotel facilities staff etc were amazing The manager at breakfast was very accommodating as I was unwell

231874,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, Great location The staff were extremely helpful The decor is stunning Nice to stay at a traditional hotel with a modern twist marble bath tv in the mirror etc The spa was also beautiful 
231875,Hotel Cafe Royal, I had requested with two written notes on my bed and in the bathroom that my bed linen and towels NOT be changed during my stay personal water saving concerns I noticed this was respected with the bed linen but not with the towels , The ultimate location And very attentionate staff 
231876,Hotel Cafe Royal, Hard to find fault without sounding nit picking Bear in mind the location you can t really compare this with many other hotels , Classic luxury hotel in the heart of London delivers as expected Great service food drink etc Expensive but what did you expect
231877,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, The hotel design comfort and facilites were the best I have experienced anywhere in my travels around the World The staff were the extremely helpful and courteous and the whole stay was a wonderful experience I highly recommend this hotel 
231878,Hotel Cafe Royal, One disappointment was the restaurant location They have a fabulous grill room but only use this for afternoon tea Where we had dinner felt like a lobby , The room and bed was huge and finished to a very high standard The pool and spa in the basement is a million miles away from central london Every little luxurious detail has been thought of in the rooms from remote controlled blinds to bluetooth music devices a tv in the mirrior in the bathroom etc high recommend it 
231879,Hotel Cafe Royal, Better lighting in the room would have been nice , I liked this hotel very much The room was pleasant comfortable and well equipped Everything in working order The staff was polite friendly and helpful I would definitely stay there again on a next trip to London 
231880,Hotel Cafe Royal, Nothing to dislike If you have to dislike something you can reach the desk 24 24 h and they solve every problem or you own butler depends on room category , Perfect location in the center of london Perfect service Modern style in old time athmosphere Insonoration You hear nothing from outside 
231881,Hotel Cafe Royal, Some miscommunication between staff e g Missing wake up calls not booking restaurant reservations properly Not huge issues but for a hotel of this class it is unexpecred to say the least Made a mediocre attempt to fix the issue with a brush off approach , friendly staff historical building great location
231882,Hotel Cafe Royal, NOTHING could have been better maybe the drinks could have been cheaper , The staff were very kind and courtious the room we had was brilliant and we enjoy ed our stay immensely Also it has the advantage of very close to all the sites and the west end
231883,Hotel Cafe Royal, No dressing table in bedroom no towel rail over bath The Library bar was not open drinks in Green Bar and mini bar far too expensive The lighting in the bedroom was too complicated , The bed was very comfortable the bathroom was well maintained with towels and toiletries

231888,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, Very comfortable outstanding staff so attentive in every way very central ideal location for public transport and walking to central London and theatres Liked having a private bathroom not open plan Wonderful breakfast 
231889,Hotel Cafe Royal, Generally we did not think the service was as good as it should have been for the money we paid The bags and rooms were mixed up It seems no efforts were made to address the special requests for room requirements made on the booking Breakfast service on the first morning was slow and the greeting on the second morning was not very hospitable Upon checkout over 60 of random service charges had been added to the bill even though we had not used anything that cost additional money emphasis on getting money out of the guests rather than ensuring a good service Generally a nice hotel but over priced and service not very professional , Location was ideal beds were very comfortable
231890,Hotel Cafe Royal, Pillows were a little too soft for my taste Though they did all they can to help and resolve issues the concierge staff can improve their abilities for securing reservations to popular venues and restaurants , Location is amazing right at Piccadilly Circus Every member of staff is very friendly and helpful The general atmosphere in the hotel is very luxurious
231891,Hotel Cafe Royal, Very low pressure in the shower The advertise a shower and separate bath tub although it s a 2 in 1 you stand next to the bath tub and shower You can t bath and shower at the same time Rooms much smaller than portrait in photos , Very friendly staff awesome location 
231892,Hotel Cafe Royal, Nothing , I booked this holiday for my kids so they could see a show Reports back were very good Although the surroundings are great the best feature is the staff who are busy but never too busy Thanks for looking after my family 
231893,Hotel Cafe Royal, The 6th floor Junior Suite was disturbing for me due to the timber on all the walls including the ceiling with a small window I requested a change of rooms the staff were obliging room was lighter had windows however the room that was allocated was much smaller although in the same category , Location Over all Facilities Service Staff

231896,Hotel Cafe Royal, The room was good lots of luxury touches yet it felt like a prison cell because of the block wall look very cold and clinical, The staff were excellent Very attentive and supportive 
231897,Hotel Cafe Royal, Need better signage to the gym spa TV channels were limited We didn t use the butler because we didn t know what they did , Beds were so comfortable Great room for our needs Caf Royal caf was excellent Bar too The concierge service was amazing Every place they recommended was perfect Christmas decorations were beautiful 
231898,Hotel Cafe Royal, Really didn t like that during holiday period the swimmimg pool was hardly accessible for children Also he lighting in the room is just too complex and very hard to operate Z, Breakfast was very good although cooked English breakfast too sweet 
231899,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, Five star hotel five star service five star comfort five star location what s not to llove No request was too much trouble and the service from every member of staff was a delight 
231900,Hotel Cafe Royal, I loved staying however I guess with the hotel being ao central in London the prices were sky high Valur for money in Manchester what I paid would have got me a suite rather than a standard room My only quibble , Such a wonderful hotel D i was apprehensive about how the rooms would feel look after a few images on the internet made them look a bit bare however they were warm comforting and luxurious Gorgeous hotel 
231901,Hotel Cafe Royal, Plus sockets in the room were few and far between and none in proximity to a mirror for hair straighteners, The staff were incredible and treated us like royalty Could not recommend it more highly
231902,Hotel Cafe Royal, Nothing negative to state , We return to this hotel several times a year and the welcome we receive the service we get and the courtesy is how a top hotel should be 
231903,Hotel Cafe Royal, Turn down service arrived at 10 30 PM on Saturday when our daughter were sound asleep , First time at Cafe Royal but surely not the last The whole family 15 13 and 7 had a wonderful weekend 
231904,Hotel Cafe Royal, Pillow and duvet I don t like down duvets Lighting was far too clever for older folk A switch will be ok The staff were ALL excellent The Manager for our Sunday lunch for my Husbands 70th was great 8 of us Food outstanding Lunch Monday excellent too staff very well trained it shows very much We met the chef too a nice young man Luckily I d booked The Bodyguard Les Mis my husbands 2 favourites and so handy for the hotel , Bacon streaky but didn t look nice black pudding the best ever Ham delicious 
231905,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, We loved everything Perfect staff Perfect room Perfect pool Perfect breakfast and we tried almost everything on the menu We celebrated our 10th anniversary I mentioned it and were greeted with cake and champagne so so nice I will be coming again and recommend to everyone and I am a hard woman to please 
231906,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, My stay at the Cafe Royale was amazing I felt that I was being pampered at all time The only thing that was not to my liking were the pillow too soft Otherwise everything was as perfect as could be Staff were helpful And they never tire of looking after one s needs
231907,Hotel Cafe Royal, Wi Fi could be improved but it s good location, Great value for money Bigger suites and rooms than usual in London even for LHW hotels Great staff very helpful with all my specific needs transportation converters reservations spa gym facilities
231908,Hotel Cafe Royal, They have an issue with their showers It can become a slippery wet and dangerous mess The window blinds fell out of the ceiling and onto my arm Some of the staff seemed new and or needed training Perhaps a recruiter whom picks people who belong in hospitality Received no compensation for many shortcomings over the course of the stay ,No Positive
231909,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, Fantastic hotel with a lovely mixture of classical and ultra modern decor The staff are amazing nothing is too much trouble Breakfast was superb We can t wait to go back 
231910,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, The Cafe Royal is a very fine hotel in a fantastic location The staff are extremely attentive courteous and helpful and we greatly enjoyed the time we spent there 
231911,Hotel Cafe Royal, The room wasn t exactly what I ve expected it was dark and all the hi tech details looked a bit worn In the in room dining menu there was a cigarette paper probably a souvenir from previous guests In room curry was a big disappointment Jacuzzi and the pool facilities could look cleaner , The staff was very nice and helpful All the services requested were provided quickly and professionally 
231912,Hotel Cafe Royal, What I didn t like and this is the only thing is the lighting is not good at all the room was very dark the lighting is very tiny lines only and all though there was lightning in the cupboards but still could not see the my clothes well Request from the external light but not helped out In future i will requst room with bigger windows maybe it will help , The location is perfect Staff and the service are excellent They treat the gusts like royals The area around the hotel is full of life day and night yoy will never get bored at all specially if you like walking
231913,Hotel Cafe Royal, nothing, Let me start off saying that we had extremely helpful staff and great room Everything in this hotel is relatively new and luxurious The staff was so nice and attentive which my wife really appreciated with the kids and the stroller they even got them Peppa pig markers the first night and left them on their bed with a balloon when they knew my daughter loved that cartoon The location could not be any better everyday we were within walking distance of the best shopping and nightlife London has to offer No question i will be coming here again 
231914,Hotel Cafe Royal, Nothing first class service, Everything we had a junior suite it was amazing staff extremely friendly couldn t do enough for you Breakfast was fabulous very clean hotel attention to detail first class would highly recommend and we have already booked to return Hotel is central
231915,Hotel Cafe Royal, Some people mentioned the size of the windows I can see how in a normal size room that might affect your enjoyment , Loved everything We got upgraded and the staff was just wonderful Beautifully designed hotel and suite luxe but not chintzy which is hard to find All the right touches Amazing spa 
231916,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, I liked everything about the hotel but the sofa beds werent so comfy and we didnt have an iron in the room although on the website it says all rooms have and iron and ironing table When you ask the room service people to bring something up you meed to ask twice or three times Reception staff would ask for deposit but when you check out they wont give the deposit nack until you ask them She also didnt want to return the deposit because she said you had breakfast with 5 person but i didnt She was thinking for another excuse and she said again oh ya you had breakfast more than a limit But nowhere on the hotel webside mention that there is a limit for breakfast 
231917,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, Amazing facility and design the first hotel which provides sleep spray any newspaper and warm floor Spa and swimming pool is great quite and cozy Breakfast is the best during our stay 
231918,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, When you stay at the Caf Royal you will expect first of all a high class hotel service The hotel staff is an enrichment for this five star hotel they are extremly friendly and willing to satisfy every wish from you The room I had was very clean and neat Although the Caf Royal is located on the busy Regent Street and a stone s throw away from Piccadilly Circus I didn t hear any noise in the room I can highly recommend a visit to their Akasha Spa Nice pool and a variety of Spa treatments If you are looking for a very fine dine seafood restaurant I can recommend Scott s restaurant on the 20th Mount Street I will definitely stay again at the Caf Royal when I am back in London 
231919,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, Fantastic hotel Nice spacious room and extra compliment for the location of the safe Smart The bathroom was amazing and practical not to mention the hairdryer Small details that I as a guest appreciate and feel that you have thought a little extra Free wifi is also modern thinking for us people of today I hope to come back 
231920,Hotel Cafe Royal, Had to wait to check in Poor cleaning of light in room Difficult key system Difficult to switch of all light get complete darkness Noisy at night , Awesome location Friendly staff nice resto bar 
231921,Hotel Cafe Royal, Cannot think of nething i did not like Frankly, Perfect Location of the hotel Courteous staff Always alert and ready to serve u Extremely comfy room
231922,Hotel Cafe Royal, The only negative feedback I have about this otherwise superb hotel is that they could not arrange for an iron and ironing board I was offered a complimentary pressing of my shirt which was greatly appreciated but this took about an hour to arrange for I was lucky that I was not pressed for time Still it was a most enjoyable experience , Everything was more or less perfect a very nice luxury hotel I did not use any of the SPA facilities so I can t comment on these 
231923,Hotel Cafe Royal, Would love if it were cheaper , Loved it all Exactly as expected a beautifully decorated clean spacious luxurious hotel with great service Spa pool was quiet and tranquil for a light swim Warm enough Location right in Picadilly was perfect Stayed one night as a treat away from kids 
231924,Hotel Cafe Royal, We paid for a 3 bed room and unfortunatley was given a roll out bed that was not fit for even a child It took quite a bit of discussion to get it fixed and even then i was provided with another roll out bed albeit with a better mattress The room was advertised as 3 beds but the 3rd only temporary Not great when spending a lot on accommodation as a treat at the end of a great trip Was disappointing It also advertised a rooftop terrace however this was only available to the penthouse apartment , The position of the hotel was great In walking distance of many great sites and the heart of Londons shopping and theatre districts It was clean and modern Staff were very friendly 
231925,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, The staff at the reception were very friendly during the check in the butler was very friendly and helpful and the room service staff were very helpful The design of the rooms and the hotel is nice the location is good as well
231926,Hotel Cafe Royal, Food is bit on the bland side as its as per European taste buds But very fresh Mattreses need to be a bit more plumpy like hotels, Beautiful hotel exceptionally clean Amazingly courteous polite and efficient staff Huge rooms Right in the shopping district Loved it 
231927,Hotel Cafe Royal, Some room basics for a five star hotel weren t included such as a kettle or dental kit When we requested a kettle the first one they brought didn t work Housekeeping didn t come the first day despite putting our cleaning truest light on We had to call them specially after we had gone out for the day , Location and pool were great 
231928,Hotel Cafe Royal, nothing, nothing was to much trouble from all the staff it was our 30th wedding anniversary and we had a lovely bottle of champagne waiting for us in our room 
231929,Hotel Cafe Royal, Returned from dinner late and upon opening the room door noticed a puddle had formed from the AC dripping from above Needed to move to another room Packed up everything and the daughter and thought they would upgrade is for our remaining night for the inconvenience No luck , In general great what you would expect from a 5 star boutique hotel in London 
231930,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, The service was second to none Tea time was the best experience but all was simply great Yes the croissants were super and extra flaky Thanks for making our stay perfect 
231931,Hotel Cafe Royal, We had asked for early check in but not just we didn t get early check in we got the rooms later than the usualy check in time we waited in the loby for several hours and they didn t even offer us a drink, Location
231932,Hotel Cafe Royal, NOTHING I just wished we could stay there FOREVER , Everything is LUXURY at its best The hotel lobby the room the staff You truly get what you pay for The location is priceless too Right in the heart of Regent street just a few steps away from Theaters Shops and restaurants We love Cafe Royal and we are sure to come back 
231933,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, The location was excellent The stuff were polite and carful The hotel building combined the old fashion as well as the modern decoration and new facility Really worth a try
231934,Hotel Cafe Royal, The loss of water and electricity , The staff and security was beyond superior The rooms were excellent too My only negative remark was the facility lost power and water for more than 12 hours which was very inconvenient obviously The location is in the middle of everything 
231935,Hotel Cafe Royal, Not given the room I requested Had to wait 2 hours to get into my room Charged for someone else s breakfast after checkout Unacceptable from a hotel of this quality , Fantastic location and room are wonderful Free access to spa 
231936,Hotel Cafe Royal, Some staff on the front desk not help Look down their noses is the right expression Luckily I take paperwork as didn t believe my booking , The look of the hotel was clean the room fantastic and the staff on the hole wonderful The doormen in air street in particular 
231937,Hotel Cafe Royal, The housekeeping who cleaning the rooms are not to the expected standard Really they need improvement , Location and some of the staff were very friendly 
231938,Hotel Cafe Royal, They asked for deposit and got authorized for more Can not know why and how I understand it gonna be returned but why , Location House keeping Cafe
231939,Hotel Cafe Royal, Rate late turndown service busy bathroom every indications signs written so tiny in the dark area including lifts , Location Gym and the size of room in comparison with other London hotels Staff very helpful and friendly
231940,Hotel Cafe Royal, Nothing I can think of , Everything Great room comfortable bed and pillows fantastic view of Picadilly Circus There was nothing we didn t like Even if you don t stay there you should book an afternoon tea in the Oscar Wilde bar if you have the opportunity 
231941,Hotel Cafe Royal, the food is so so the reception people are not professional not trained to be work in five star hotel one of the reception lady she se yes about something and after few second she say no and then yes maybe n 5 times she keep changing her word and the hotel lighting is dark the check out teaks so long because they add extra charge for something that i haven t used, the concierge people the bed the bathroom
231942,Hotel Cafe Royal, Our grand junior suite was right next to the lift which kept me awake at night as quite loud The roll in bed was very uncomfortable , Friendly approachable staff who couldn t do enough for you Fabulous hotel in a great location Loved the gym and spa facilities
231943,Hotel Cafe Royal, No plugs near the mirrors and no mirror above the desk in the bedroom made it difficult to style hair , Location was perfect The bed was comfy staff very friendly and breakfast great All very good 
231944,Hotel Cafe Royal, Check in staff not terribly helpful Housekeeping staff needs to be reminded to bring face towels shower caps no bath tub despite big bathroom bed appeared over used , Location concierge services prompt and polite hi tech yet retaining the sense of classy 19 century European hotels 
231945,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, Excellent and well run hotel Would recommend to any well discerning Middle Eastern travelling with family Even after checking out they provided a room to pray salaat which was very nice of the hotel 
231946,Hotel Cafe Royal, Very few staff at restaurants and cafe we had to wait too long for service very Anoying waste of time We had to go out for meals, Location interiors beds promptness for requested items and amenities food reasonable prices for London
231947,Hotel Cafe Royal, the rooms feel like either prison cells the stone wall version or the inside of a coffin the wooden version we tried both seems they have gone for some version of minimalist art however leaves the rooms feeling cold ,No Positive
231948,Hotel Cafe Royal, We got stuck in an elevator for 5 min but all worked out well in the end they were most accommodating free bottle of champagne for our adventure , Beautiful hotel centrally located The Rooms appear to be soundproofed as my GF did well and she is a very very light sleeper Everything was as expected in a luxury property You get what you pay for still holds true Only disappointment was I did not reserve early enough for tea in Oscar Wilde room so they could not acomadate our time But my failure to plan is not their issue I would recommend the property highly
231949,Hotel Cafe Royal, Nothing to dislike about Hotel Cafe Royal first class from start to finish , Everything was perfect Afternoon Tea in the Oscar Wilde Bar was lovely far too much to eat though our cakes that we couldn t quite manage to eat were packed up into a box and posh bag for us to take away excellent customer service 
231950,Hotel Cafe Royal, thought the room felt a bit oppressive and a little too stylistic for my liking , enjoyed the location and the style of the hotel the staff were very helpful and the food was great
231951,Hotel Cafe Royal, Nothing , The hotel has a really lively vibe to it Very different to some of the other rather stuffy hotels in the city the breakfast in the hotel is a great start of the day 
231952,Hotel Cafe Royal, Excellent hotel staff but main restaurant service at dinner was slightly off during our visit , Very well executed restauration and modernization Tasteful design integrates modern with the grand 
231953,Hotel Cafe Royal, Breakfast that is inclusive in the package is not serve automatically and not being explain if what is included and what is with additional charges we waited an hour for the main course to be served in the club lounge , Very accessible location hotel is grand luxurious with professional staffs to meet every travellers needs 
231954,Hotel Cafe Royal, The room had a couple of dinks that hadn t been rectified yet a chipped door to the wardrobe and a stained marble coffee table There was a tiny weenie bit of noise from outside but given you re onto of Piccadilly Circus I was expecting a lot lot more , Our room for fairly spectacular in a contemporary style but the bathroom was the scene stealer functionally beautiful in marble We loved the huge comfy bed and my 3yo was given his own kid sized dressing gown and slippers at turndown We used the Club which was a nice down to earth place for a night cap There was a wedding going on and yet it didn t feel they had taken over in fact barely saw them The between room soundproofing is excellent not a peep The breakfast was delicious and the staff were incredibly friendly with my son asking him directly what he wanted for breakfast and talking about his teddy This is the type of thing that makes me want to come back to a property 
231955,Hotel Cafe Royal, There was nothing we didn t like, The staff were fantastic made our stay really special Next time we are in London we will definitely be back again Superb all round
231956,Hotel Cafe Royal, No clear distinction of the hotel on the street If you re not familiar with the streets buildings of London you could easily walk past the hotel and not take notice of it Walls floors and room doors are not sound proof I would ve much rather been disturbed by the noise in the streets than from guest neighbors and hotel staff Easily hear housekeeping and other staff talking walking Frustrating For a five star hotel one would expect sound proof doors at least Though the hotel is relatively new the eclectic themed rooms are way outdated most of the room features such as lighting A C and curtains are controlled electronically and sometimes they didn t work properly , I always stay at the Four Seasons hotel on Park Lane but decided to change this time and I was not disappointed for the most part The hotel s theme I noticed was a hybrid of Armani hotel Milan and The Doler Grand Zurich Classic yet eclectic The staff were friendly and very professional Facilities were good gym pool O mazing food Ten Room restaurant in room dining 
231957,Hotel Cafe Royal, The lighting console in the bedroom too complicated, The size of our room it was enormous with a separate dressing room big enough for a bed for our young son So he slept soundly whilst we watched tv in our room Also liked the complimentary teddy bear free movie and popcorn for our son 
231958,Hotel Cafe Royal, we felt the staff although very polite and most helpful were a bit to formal, We liked the architect it and history of the hotel the cleanliness and general attention to detail were exemplory We only had one meal but were more than satisfied with the quality and service
231959,Hotel Cafe Royal, Hidden extra charges The fact that the complimentary lounge charged for everything except the use of the lounge , The staff were very helpful and friendly The room was very comfortable and spacious The little extras such as fruit and bottle of wine in the room were very welcome 
231960,Hotel Cafe Royal, The over minimalistic decor somewhat carceral in the rooms decorator should pay attention to the building s history Japanese minimalistic style would probably be OK elsewhere The Club Lounge supposed to offer quietness is just above the atrium lobby very noisy The absence of buffet breakfast The non vaccuumed corridor from elevator to room , The location The spa The staff The bed quality 
231961,Hotel Cafe Royal, Lighting controls were overly complex Very minor issue though compared to the positives , The hotel is in a great location the staff are friendly and helpful The bedroom and bathroom were excellent with all the facilities you need 
231962,Hotel Cafe Royal, Not much No artwork on the walls of the room made it seem a little minimal and lacking in character and whilst the bed was very large I didn t find the mattress completely comfortable but am used to a Tempur and always struggle with anything else , Friendly and helpful staff Large room with lot s of technology Breakfast of high quality if quite expensive Great location but no noise from outside even on the 2nd floor
231963,Hotel Cafe Royal, Although there were many adjustment switches for the lights it was not possible to control different lamps separately Also the switch for the light for the bathroom was inside the bathroom making it difficult to turn the light on at night, Spa hi tech
231964,Hotel Cafe Royal, Their could have been a better parking facility for guests When you arrive at the Cafe Royal Hotel the road is exstremly narrow so other vehicles have to pass by mounting the kerb , The bath tub was amazing very relaxing Me and my girlfriend both enjoyed the spa together such polite staff throughout the hotel 
231965,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, For 2 days we really felt like a princess prince form a fairy tail or beauty and the beast Entering the hotel Tasha really made us feel at home She gave us a very warm welcome professional and to the point The room was luxurious with eye for detail The spa excellent and the breakfast what can is say just delicious Concierge James was extremely helpful map guides great choice in booking restaurant for us and even leaving entering the hotel was a nice experience because of bellboy Jerome In my opinion the room is important but it s the service that makes the real difference In this hotel everybody loves their job and it reflects on fairy tail service they provide Many thanks to make us feel like royalty Mrs Mr Dilissen
231966,Hotel Cafe Royal, On our first day we were looking quite normal met a receptionist whom asked us if we have a booking we said yes and then she said in this hotel That seemed a bit condescending but apart from it it was beautiful , Loved the bed and the tranquility of the spa
231967,Hotel Cafe Royal, during the check out I found in my bill 13 extra for each breakfast I ordered even the receptionist told me about it before signing my bill I think this is not acceptable way of getting tip further what they are doing with walking customer whom they come for breakfast only do they tell them as well , Hospitality and warm welcoming from everybody 
231968,Hotel Cafe Royal, Nothing to dislike with every hotel in London the mini bars are over the top expensive just avoid them , From the moment we walked in the hotel the staff were very helpful excellent service room lovely and very quiet cocktail bar great Have stayed in a few 4 5 star hotels in London and this is one of my favourites not cheap but well worth it 
231969,Hotel Cafe Royal, It all start with the reception desk basically nobody smiles The general state of mind is to continuously explain why you can get this or that The problem are all yours and you are bothering them Then you get to your room where many things are out of services including the shower that gives either burning hot water or ice cold noway to find a midway The BF is simply absurd you either have a la carte choice next to the reception or a la carte choice in the caf There they would server food first and then 15min later toast that goes with it The idea that they could come together is apparently not yet on there agenda The kids had a very small access window to the swimming pool more or else 1 hour in the morning and one in the afternoon But keep in mind they aren t really welcome in this place and you get the message very clearly from the staff When you see staff anyway in the corridors they wait for your to say Hello otherwise they just stare at you The food is very medium level for this kind of hotel The concierge is totally lost you can ask for your car or anything he always has to check what Good question But the bottom line is that you have to wait no way to get something in a reasonable time Very very disappointing stay way too expensive for the service TO BE AVOIDED , The hotel location and the architecture are fantastic 
231970,Hotel Cafe Royal, We would have preferred a room with a vew of Regent Street , Excellent location lovely room and fantastic staff Breakfast extra 25 per person was well worth the spend as this set up us for the day of seeing all the tourist spots Loved our stay at The Cafe Royal and will definitely stay there again Beautiful hotel in a great location right near Picadilly Circus 
231971,Hotel Cafe Royal, Nothing everything was perfect , We loved the modern high quality conversion of a traditional building Thoroughly enjoyed the luxury of a late checkout which gave us time to enjoy the lovely pool 
231972,Hotel Cafe Royal, The free wifi was a disappointment to have a free wifi that is VERY slow VERY was useless I cloud t watch shows any websites with images video would take ages to load The bed and pillows were not that comfortable I hated the pillows the soft one was too soft and the firm one was too firm T T We requested to stay on the 2nd floor when we booked which was the biggest mistake to have big windows but we got regular size window which you cannot open or close cause it has a key so every time I had to call for that which was annoying Plus the room was right above the bar which meant too much disturbance and frustration to hear noises which surprisingly no one could knew where is it from the cleanliness for me was below average for 5 stars hotel , The staff were very helpful friendly and respectful They would immediately help with any request I loved that 
231973,Hotel Cafe Royal, A very minor disappointment was that the room only had a shower albeit a very good one and a bath would have been very nice I had expected a bath for the price of the room but after looking at the room descriptions after returning it was clear that the room I booked only had a shower I just didn t see that at the time of booking , Staff service was the best I ve experienced in a UK hotel As soon as we arrived we were made to feel very special and nothing was too much trouble The room was immaculately clean and the hotel interior was stunning The breakfast food was very nice and we had the opportunity to enjoy food in the club late afternoon and rooms service one evening 
231974,Hotel Cafe Royal, Service was a little slow and prices of drinks were silly in comparison with other 5 star properties we have stayed in, The quality of the property and style of the rooms
231975,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, Bed was very comfy staff very accommodating It was my GF s birthday and they even delivered a cake to the room great touch Breakfast was very filling and the quality of food was very high Great little gin bar which we visited each night Really rate the place 
231976,Hotel Cafe Royal, Service can be hit and miss Check in staff was great reception staff yes it s different was oblivious to the fact I was a hotel guest and some restaurant staff for afternoon tea just left us to it , The room was superb and comfortable Bathroom is great what a shower and the overall design of the place is truly wonderful 
231977,Hotel Cafe Royal, Honestly there wasn t a thing to dislike, From the moment of arrival at this beautiful historic hotel until we checked out we were made to feel very special everything met up to our expectations and more The rooms were incredible high tec stunning marble bathrooms and soundproof windows with a view of Regents street 
231978,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, Amazing service Gave us an upgrade on our first ever stay with them The rooms were so gorgeous The best part was the bathrooms though spectacular architecture 
231979,Hotel Cafe Royal, The lighting in room could be more flexible and brighter , The location is excellent and love the historical background of this hotel Staffs are lovely 
231980,Hotel Cafe Royal, I have requested through booking com to have twin beds in one of the rooms we booked but it wasn t given to us until NEXT day However the polite reception employees tried resolving it , The friendly staff and how they made everything easy
231981,Hotel Cafe Royal, Breakfast would have been better suited to a buffet style as opposed to al acarte, The staff were extremely efficient they have a fantastic eye for detail and even remembered my sons name after one intro
231982,Hotel Cafe Royal, Club privliges paid for club closed but we were offered to be allowed in to the bar on new years eve for 50 GBP per person and on top of paying 1200 GBP a night with no breakfast for a room with windows that looked like they had last been washed during WWII well gosh what more could I say than hmmm, Like real estate location location etc
231983,Hotel Cafe Royal, We had bad incident at the spa as my friend therapist were just awful and rude to her for the 80 minutes session Didn t get an apology when I raised the issue but we weren t charge for her service Didn t feel the room was cleaned properly on daily bases wish it was cleaned more throughly Booked a driver to Hampshire and they quoted me for 180 for the ride not mentioning it was per hour and then at checkout i was charged 500 something Even thou i thought i would only pay 180 I paid 360 for driving us there and back for the hotel wish the staff were more specific Lastly the beds for us were a definite problem it just felt so uncomfortable even thou the room was great I wish the bed were just as luxuries t , we had the grand superior room with two single beds the room space is amazing we had it at the second floor which was fantastic we had wide windows which is always a plus The room for me was absolutely amazing more beautiful than the connaught room and the beaumont However the cleaning and the bed mattress were a problem 
231984,Hotel Cafe Royal, The price but its right in the middle of London and couldn t have been much better , There s very little about this hotel that I didn t like Its gorgeous 
231985,Hotel Cafe Royal, they charge for printing documents over 10 pages 1st time this happens to us in a hotel of that level, location room is very comfirtable clean very good service
231986,Hotel Cafe Royal, The only criticism was that our room was a little on the warm , The attention to detail was excellent the staff were very happy to help in anyway they could that s a real tribute to the staff training and senior management 
231987,Hotel Cafe Royal, Nothing , Avery thing best hotel in London felt like a VIP The room was equipped with cutting edge technology I loved the idea of the lift Soo cool One thing is it s a bit expensive but it worth it 
231988,Hotel Cafe Royal, Lighting was too complex in bedroom Shouldn t need an engineering degree to work it out , Location is great nice design and style inside Enjoyable atmosphere in the Cafe for breakfast although expensive Comfortable bed and nice bathroom 
231989,Hotel Cafe Royal, Please be careful with hotel concierge staff I bought opera tickets through them but they over charged me over 50 on purpose without telling me the details ,No Positive
231990,Hotel Cafe Royal, awful breakfast no variety at all You need to wait almost half an hour to get a decent piece of food even though there are only a few more people at the restaurant Worst breakfast experience in London ever The front desk staff s English pronunciation is bad There are far more elegant and luxurious hotels nearby for this value room toilet is too small, Excellent location clean and good rooms
231991,Hotel Cafe Royal, The pictures of the room I selected in booking com is a bit misleading especially in this hotel as rooms does vary from floor to floor , Everything was ok during the stay 
231992,Hotel Cafe Royal, some things didn t work in the room such as cartains didn t close properly TV not enough music chanels Water pressure in the shower low, Location and service
231993,Hotel Cafe Royal,No Negative, moment walked the rough the door the staff were attentive The level of device was world class I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who expects the best of everything I like the ocsar wilde bar afternoon tea and it s my favorite place in the hotel and It is known and famous since 1865 
231994,Hotel Cafe Royal, Low security in regards to Elevators cards check , 1 Excellent Location 2 Excellent staff 3 Excellent Room facility Bathroom design etc 4 Great WiFi 5 Great spa Gym
231995,Hotel Cafe Royal, The sign to the spa is very discreet the operator didn t give good instruction to the direction to the spa Despite this the swimming pool is worth visiting given it is in Central London It s not easy to find a clean and high standard pool in Central London hotels The decor of the room is good but make you feel like staying inside the box coz it s all mounted by wooden panel inculding the roof , The staff are all well mannered except the chauffer that drove us to the airport He was kind of rude when he saw my child left the empty doggie bag in the car he impatiently asked her to remove it when we were leaving the car upon arrival to the airport I supposed he could clean up the little garbage as we had loads of baggages to carry I didn t expect to pay GBP110 for this kind of service 
231996,Hotel Cafe Royal, Nothing negative about this hotel , Everything Location was brilliant Literally 100 metres from Piccadilly Circus Service was outstanding by all staff members Loved the underfloor heating in the luxurious bathroom not to mention the secret TV hidden in the vanity mirror Beautiful decor throughout entire hotel
