329543,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, Room was too small for the price thank God I booked the terrace otherwise you keep bumping into each other , Excellent location very close to the Metro Friendly staff clean 
329544,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC,No Negative, Great stay Comfortable clean and well situated it was our first time visiting Barcelona the hotel is an easy walk to the things you want to do Would definitely stay here again 
329545,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, Reception staff can only understand English when they want to If you go with a problem they decide they don t understand you The man on reception is extremely rude and seems to dislike women The staff put you off right away I wouldn t recommend this hotel to anyone , Good location 
329546,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, The terrace room was not great Too cramped for 2 pax and no privacy with a toilet with a glass door Terrace a bit of a waste , Location was amazing staff were friendly 
329547,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, When we first arrived to the hotel by car I hurried to the reception to get the directions to the parking while my husband was waiting for me in the car They handed me a paper with a map drawn on it and on which the names of streets were barely showing The lady who was at the reception asked me to wait until her colleagues finishes with the clients so that he can explain to me how to get there since it was my first time in Barcelona When I asked the guy for further directions he laughed sarcastically and said just follow the map as if I was stupid to ask him this question I think he was the manager for that evening When we wanted to check in and they couldnt find Lebanon on their system the lady helping me asked him so he also sarcastically commented in italian and started laughing The next day we needed more towels so I called the reception and the same guy answered saying he doesnt have anyone to bring us towels but if need be he can give us a towel if we come to reception which I find to be a little bit unprofessional I mean he could have at least asked a colleague but anyway I was not impressed at all with the staff however the bed was comfy , The bed was comfy that s all 
329548,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, The hotel has some small signs of wear and tear Water pipe in our room was leaking a bit but was fixed in 1 day We were staying on the top floor so there were some signs of moisture caused damage on the ceiling All that said I recommed this place , I think the location was superb in Barcelona Between Pla a de Catalunya and Pla a d Espanya Great and very tasty breakfast Very nice staff 
329549,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, Their snack menu was limited in time choices Small pool , Around a 10 min walk to La Rambla a fantastic place to walk around Very clean Room is very big and spacious Friendly staff and reception Has a free to use business center computers a printer 
329550,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, The bar was inefficient with only one person covering room service and Bar Breakfast was overpriced at 17 euros per person the breakfast in a cafe a short walk away was 6 euro s per person , The Beds were comfortable shower room smelled of drains generally clean staff were pleasant but inexperienced didn t know the name of the restaurant next door and were not exceedingly helpful 
329551,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, Lifts remain out of order most of th time and only one was working, Staff was pleasant and friendly location was verygood and excess to shopping area metro bus was easy hotel was neat and clean
329552,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, Perhaps the lift frequency in the mornings when the maids were swinging into action, Have stayed in 5 star hotels worldwide and also in Barcelona This little gem came as a complete surprise The staff looked as if they were enjoying every moment of their work Politness smiles and great service The hotel have found the key to great customer pleasure and satisfaction Compliments Can t wait to stay there again in the future
329553,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, The buffet breakfast had a good variety of options However the restaurant staff couldn t make my eggs as I liked even after several attempts by the chef I requested my fried eggs to be well done but even after 3 attempts they were still very burnt and runny in the middle , Staff were very friendly and helpful Hotel was very clean throughout Beach is bit far to walk but is roughly 5 mins in taxi 
329554,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC,No Negative, The staff were extremely lovely the room and the bathroom was so clean the air conditioning was just what we needed after a long hot day The pool and outside area was really nice annnnnd as a lover of sushi they partnered with a sushi takeaway as a to service Will definitely come back and recommend
329555,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, I noticed that payment was taken from my account upon booking I believe this is for verification purposes and the payment was then refunded a lower amount due to exchange rates This effectively causes the bank to apply fees for non a non UK transaction Upon final payment another set of fees are applicable for another non UK transaction I have not come across this before but certainly something this is not desirable , Location is excellent and within 50 steps of the Urgell Metro station and 10 15 min walk to Las Ramblas This is a straightforward and un complicated Hotel ideal for business trips Facilities are adequate breakfast was up to standards and really affordable 
329556,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, Pool is a bit too small for my taste It s more like a exercise pool or jacuzzi Buildings surrounding the pool area are not pleasant to look at , Location and friendly staff 
329557,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, Nothing at all, Great location excellent quality interior very friendly staff super comfortable bed Id book at this hotel every time i go to barcelona
329558,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, They were doing work to a wall in the corridor opposite our room at the time of the stay so it was a bit of a tight squeeze It was no problem though, The buffet breakfast each morning was well worth the extra Location was great near to 2 Metro stops and staff were super friendly 
329559,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, I felt the room s bathroom window was not covered enough felt a bit exposed When I went to the guest s kitchen it was a bit disorganized , I liked the price the staff 24 7 reception desk availability toiletries and towels included well functioning air conditioner and tv availability of yoga classes on certain days 
329560,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, The bathroom condition is not that good The towel rack got a bit rust and the size was too small It was also inconvenient that the bathroom and the toilet were separated into 2 spaces by wall , Every staff was really nice and kind with happy smile English fluency was really good Some of staffs gave us map with explanation about the neighborhood There were welcoming drinks but we didn t take them Room cleaning service is good as well 
329561,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, Nothing, Very nicely located not to far away from the busy areas but just enough to get a good nights sleep Rooms were cleaned every day and the reception staff were very helpful with any questions about the city 
329562,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, I arrived really needing wifi and both check in and wifi were down for the entire 24 hours I was later compensated by the Management but it was a real downer and I wasted a lot of time trying to find a wifi location The reception simply said nothing we can do It s down instead of trying to link up with a next door cafe in what could have been a win win situation Not a good idea to try to replicate Vueling plane decor in a hotel Grey and yellow for a bedroom I think not , Hotel was willing to accept a package that arrived by courrier before my arrival and I am grateful Bed and shower were good Close to the Aerobus stop a block away Great pastry shop next door 
329563,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, Tiny pool short staffed at night and the bathroom area doesn t offer much privacy As is common now the bathroom area is an open space with the toilet and shower closed off excellent shower with rain and normal shower heads , As hotel prices in BCN have skyrocketed for the summer this hotel is good value especially for the location We had a twin room which was quite roomy for 2 twin beds a desk 2 chairs a huge walk in shower and even a little balcony all great The pool was VERY tiny and a bit disappointing but with the beach not far it was acceptable The location is perfect walking distance to all my top neighbourhoods I m a frequent visitor Ramblas Eixample El Born and even not that long a walk to the beach if you re inclined to take the scenic route about 45 minutes Many many restaurants and bars very near by to fit all budgets The staff was friendly and helpful although some of the hotel policies seem to cut corners perhaps emblematic of Vueling itself no bell staff from about 9pm to 9am so if you need anything like towels or an iron you have to go fetch it We didn t try the restaurant or bar with so many fantastic places in BCN to check out 
329564,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, There was only one sink outside the toilet shower area for washing hands the same sink was used for making tea washing glasses etc which we didn t think was appropriate , The hotel is very modern bright We slept in a front room noise was very minimal maybe just morning traffic The hotel itself was very quiet no banging doors noise from lifts etc allowing for a good nights sleep The staff were really lovely helpful if you needed advice on anything at all 
329565,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC,No Negative, Location close to major city attractions and the hotel is a modern clean hotel with good wifi and a wonderful shower Good breakfast till 11 00AM during the week and 11 30AM during the weekend
329566,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, Just would have loved access to a jug for tea coffee but the area has lots of cafes which means that you don t have to travel far for breakfast , Staff were very friendly and helpful Fair sized room for the price Conveniently located near a metro stop for using public transport The air transport theme was neat 
329567,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, All good really but the room furniture is getting to feel a bit used, Staff very helpful we were allowed to rest in the pool area although we had checked out much earlier taxis very efficiently booked for me breakfast excellent hotel quiet and well located and we loved our private terrace

329572,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, If you store your room key close to cell phone it doesn t work anymore and you have to reset it at reception One night the internet was not working late in the evening till next morning Normally internet works fine and easy acces with simple wifi code , Nice hotel very friendly staff Helpful and flexible Especially liked the bed large enough soft and the perfect shower 
329573,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, Pricey hotel for size but in centre of Barcelona and the week of Barcelona Open Tennis , Good location near Metro near cafes restaurants 24 hr parking nearby a clever concept hotel inside of aircraft A small hotel but has everything we needed Good toiletries in the bathroom Great shower Lovely fruit platter on our return to our room on second day

329578,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, A pick pocket stole lots of money from my partners deep front jean pocket when on the street in Barcelona This was obviously no fault of the Hotel but a warning for everyone not to carry much money on you and only in inside pockets , Everything seemed new and modern decor inside Staff were great especially the bell boy Wonderful shower and extremely comfortable bed No noise from Street Many cafe s and restaurants close by with amazing food Easy to walk to lots of tourist spots including La Sagrada Familia and La Rambla Taxi s buses and Metro a few steps out front door Great value for money

329614,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, Swimming pool is very small and overlooked from every angle , The property is central so easy to access many of the popular tourist destinations The gym was an added bonus small but it has enough for a really good workout Metro literally outside 
329615,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, Staff can do better in every aspect especially knowledge info about Barcelona , location is awesome Convenient to every resort but quiet hidden in gran via 1 2 min to metro station urgell 
329616,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, The first room we had was for three people The room was so small there was no space for putting our things or moving around Getting ready was also a challenge We requested a larger room and was given one the next day This room was larger and better for 3 people , The breakfast was outstanding Great coffee

329618,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, The pool size pictures on the web are misleading I do not consider that to be a pool Important to know that it is a very small pool The television connection was bad for some channels like Disney It was not working or breaking up Toilet paper was not refilled after first cleaning visit The lack of light in the family suite The window was more like a light opening except no light came in So it felt like a basement room , The location is really good and the breakfast was delicious with some Spanish specialties like the fuet the cheese and grilled vegetables was great The room size for family was very good Kids didn t complain about the sofa bed

329621,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, I suggest carpeting the hallways Pergo floors are good but are not the best sound absorption materials for a hotel facility , This is one of the most friendly stuff I have experienced in many years of traveling Excellent customer care and professionalism Great convinient location 
329622,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, At the front desk you can find great staff like the young lady that checked me in and staff that doesn t even recognize you as a client they could probably use more communication as well there isn t many info about the hotel s services like the pool restaurant bar or gym in the rooms you can t find that info either As the hotel was having some maintenance done there were some awkward moments like the fire alarm shooting at 7am and having to wait to get inside the hotel because they were fixing the front door in the middle of the day However this are details The overall experience was great and I would definetely go back , Great location and welcoming The rooms look amazing and are truly comfortable The housekeeping service was great

329636,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC,No Negative, close to the center good sized room helpful staff quiet eventhough on the main street but that could be due to the fact that my room was facing the oposite side on the way to the airport line 
329637,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, The door of the toilett is made of glass and doesn t close completely That s something you must deal with , The main road in front of the street is really noisy but the windows shut very well so with clodes windows noise is not a problem

329655,Hotel Vueling Bcn by HC, Unfortunately we left som bread in the open So we had a little visitor during the night but the bottom of my shoe fixed him I heard that the building was for many years occupied by squatters completely blown out when renovated and it has been an extremely long and hot summer Wife not too pleased though , Very new and modern hotel Being in a very expensive city every m2 is accounted or however we got an upgrade due to the fact that we payed about 920 euros parking and taxes include for 3 nights being a little rusty on booking com my own bl d y fault We did get an upgrade to a great room though on the intiative of the hotel staff spacious for Barcelona and with great beds We had requested a room towards the very busy Gran Via street on the third floor and with the doors to the small balcony closed it was completely silent Good and silent but complicated A C Parking in a nice garage with securitypersonell located in the same block 20 euros 24 hours The pool area is towards the back on the ground floor Small but clean and overall nice pool area with sunbeds and towels open till 21 Small but adequate bike crosstrainer walkingband and some weights gym in the basement Everything but the room was very cramped like in a plan but nice Nice soft flooring without the regular dirty walltowall carpeting Professional und not unfriendly staff I remember the catalans in general being quite rude but this time I was overall pleasantly surprised Buses 50 straight to Camp Nou and metro right outside To your left there is a very nice but very busy bakery cum caf called Escriba We opted for another one go right and next crossing over Gran Via it s called 555 2 women owns runs it opened 9 months ago Excellent coffe bread etc Great and fast sevice Avoid the bar restaurant called Guito across the Gran Via from the hotel It has blue signs and awful awful service After waiting 10 min for the menu the waiter when asked about somehing on the menu said How should I know I am not a chef We upped and left I would say if you can get this hotel for 125 150 euros a night incl taxes its a bargain
