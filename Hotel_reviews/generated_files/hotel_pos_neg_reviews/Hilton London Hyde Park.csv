42641,Hilton London Hyde Park, The hotel is old and drab and not what you would expect of a Hilton property The rooms are also small less than 20 square metres with the terrible bathrooms that you can only find in London The breakfasts were good but nothing varied in the week I was there , The location is excellent next to a tube and bus station so you can be in central London in 10 minutes Plenty of eating places around the corner The staff were friendly and helpful 
42642,Hilton London Hyde Park, Room temperature was to hot on arrival then was very cold through the evening had to keep playing around with it Would be better to have a dress table above seat and seat area rather than the tv as my partner found it hard to get change , The staff were very friendly all weekend 
42643,Hilton London Hyde Park, Some of the rooms contain a bit old furniture the bed wasn t very comfortable The bathroom also seemed to be a bit old , The location of the hotel is great 2 minutes from Queensway underground station and few minutes walk from Baseway underground station Few minutes from the hotel you have a large variety of shops supermarkets cafes and restaurants which are open until midnight 
42644,Hilton London Hyde Park, Bed was a little too hard but that s just own personal preference , The layout of the room was clean and was walking distance to near by tube stations 
42645,Hilton London Hyde Park, The room was not clean There was some rubbish in the drawer and floor was really dirty Wifi also didn t work throughout the day This otel is not like other Hiltons , Only location 
42646,Hilton London Hyde Park,No Negative, Location is closed to both Queensway next to hotel and Bayswater tube stations 5 minute walk and very convenient in getting around the city There are many options for great places to eat Chinese American Italian Mediterranean Indian as well as convenient stores like Tesco and Sainsbury There is a strip of souvenir shops that s really a good bargain compared to tourist spots 
42647,Hilton London Hyde Park, Mostly the very very bad customer service, Noisy and the shower tap fell off plugs didnt work Other tenants were noisy but i could hear them so clearly so the room had no insulation When i complained i was fobbed off Next day not even an apology or offer for compensation from the miserable front counter staff Terrible Never stay at hilton group again absolute crap and expensive
42648,Hilton London Hyde Park, The fact the hotel has taken an extra 50 pound on top of the price of are room for reasons incase we eat in the hotel or had room service I told them I wasn t n they still taken it Am waiting for it to be put back to my account Should state this on the booking site , Was right by the train station so easy to get about 
42649,Hilton London Hyde Park, Toilet looked like it hadn t been bleached for 6months Not my usual experience of a hilton hotel Took me 45 minutes to contact the reception desk and when finally through to request 2 rooms side by side the agent hung up on me Upon arrival the booking i had on my email clearly said 2 rooms but on arrival they only had one room ready so the other room was on a different corridor after requesting side by side rooms Wouldn t book a hilton again after this ,No Positive
42650,Hilton London Hyde Park, Extremely dates and basic rooms nothing like on the website Was a strong smell of cigarettes in the room Juts didn t feel like a treat more like a burden, Good location
42651,Hilton London Hyde Park,No Negative, Friendly staff and very accommodating upgraded our room for my husbands Birthday no extra charge Birthday message and chocolates given as well Breakfast good location great
42652,Hilton London Hyde Park, Not very clean It s overpriced as it wasn t at the same level of quality like other Hilton hotels No wi fi in the rooms The carpet needs to be changed There were wheels at our bed , It was just ok The location was great 
42653,Hilton London Hyde Park, The tv kept loosing signal and there was a crackling sound coming from behind It didn t sound very safe at all The bathroom was really small The door to the room let in an awful lot of light during the night we had to use costs and scarfs to block out the light corridor lights should at least be dimmed during the night , The rooms were regularly cleaned and well kept No marks on bedding 
42654,Hilton London Hyde Park, Decor very dated Chips in the bath grout in the tiles all brown and stained A mans shaving hairs all under the taps Stains all over the carpet Bedding doesn t actually fit the bed and the quilt hangs out of the sheets Travel lodge and premier inn are a lot cleaner than this hotel Won t be booking this hotel in the future as we were very disappointed with the quality Was not what I expected when booking The Hilton ,No Positive
42655,Hilton London Hyde Park, The accessible room we were put into first not requested was pretty drab The sink was tiny and very low The next room we were put in was nicer but the photos do not accurately represent either of the rooms we stayed in , The location was great Close to Notting Hill Hyde Park Holland Park good shopping near several well connected tube stations Also when I rang about being dissatisfied with the room we were offered a different room the next night right away Aubaine downstairs is pleasant 
42656,Hilton London Hyde Park, The breakfast could have had a few more choices as well as choice of tea not ready brewed earl gray But still Very nice breakfast The complimentary products in bathroom were not up to scratch so do bring your own , Stayed in King size room with a view over Hyde Park and LOVED it Very friendly and serviceminded staff Wonderful breakfast although a tad bit smaller than we were used to it had both English and continental breakfast 
42657,Hilton London Hyde Park, The room I was given was nothing like the light and spacious single advertised it was very dark and the sound proofing was terrible My room was prepaid but due to a family emergency I had to leave one day early I have appealed twice in writing to the manager for either a refund or credit note but have not even had the courtesy of a reply , Close to the tube 
42658,Hilton London Hyde Park, The staff were not friendly rooms furniture is not that good and the room view There was a fire in one of the shops in the same hotel building and everyone was safe but hotel staff didn t interact with us regarding this incident, Location and the resturent
42659,Hilton London Hyde Park, It got very cold in our rooms at night and the heater in our room never worked Despite asking for help no member of staff came along to assist us We stayed for a period of two nights and 3 days Our shower only had hot water to bathe with on the first day and it was ice cold for the next two No help was provided once again You would expect better customer service than this from a Hilton brand , Only the location was an advantage at this property 
42660,Hilton London Hyde Park, Small drab room with poor London plumbing Good but monotonous breakfasts Lacking the facilities that you would expect of a Hilton Hotel Cheap for London GBP 104 but expensive when compared to overseas properties , Located next to Queensway Station and a bus stop into central London Easy to get anywhere in London 
42661,Hilton London Hyde Park, Being made to wait in the foyer for half an hour for our room to be prepared The cleanliness tide mark round the sink The size of the room for the money paid wasn t a pleasant stay really , The breakfast
42662,Hilton London Hyde Park, Horrendous meal serve warm red wine food if poor standard cold draft throughout meal A very special night completely ruined House keeping such a low standard room hardly touched even dirty coffee cups left items left on floor no fresh towels or refill of tea coffee Stains on carpet and filthy shower Happy to forward photos on as this page won t except them ,No Positive
42663,Hilton London Hyde Park, No complimentary water in a room renovation of properties is required, Bathrobes and slippers comfort bed tea and coffee maker set free wifi good breakfast good location
42664,Hilton London Hyde Park, I was surprised to have to pay a deposit as as far as I know this was not mentioned on the site I booked the room on It was fine on this occasion as I had a credit card with me but it would have been a substantial chunk of our spending money otherwise , Friendly staff and in a great place We were able to leave our bags at the hotel during the day after check out with no problems too which made our day much easier We got this room reduced with a deal online so we felt it was great value for money 
42665,Hilton London Hyde Park, The rooms need updated for Hilton you expect the cleanest rooms and modern We had chewing gum in our bin We have stayed in hiltons around the world and this unfortunately did not Compare, Upgraded to a beautiful suite on the last day for a reduced price
42666,Hilton London Hyde Park,No Negative, The hotel was welcoming and check in very efficient Our room was clean and reasonably spacious It was also good to be able to look right over Hyde Park 
42667,Hilton London Hyde Park, Concierge they need more men as it was awkward to have women in high heels lifting heavy suitcases , The hotel was located right by Queensway underground station The Ac in the room was faulty the day we checked in we complained and our room was changed immediately to a bigger one Free upgrade and we remained there till we left 
42668,Hilton London Hyde Park, The room faced into other rooms I booked for park views However we arrived 2 hours before check in and were given the first available room so we only waited 20 minutes for the room , Location to tube and carparking 
42669,Hilton London Hyde Park, Breakfast Spread could have been much better Rooms were small especially taken with Queen Bed , Best part is the location of the property Bang Opposite Hyde Park and right above the Queensway Tube Station Notting Hill Orchard Street all within walking distance 
42670,Hilton London Hyde Park,No Negative, Everyone was so pleasant happy and helpful the hotel was so comfortable and very clean and it was round the corner from the tube station so easy to go anywhere in London 
42671,Hilton London Hyde Park,No Negative, Hotel is directly across the street from Hyde Park The tube was literally 20 steps away Staff were welcoming and helpful with our questions Rooms were clean and spacious
42672,Hilton London Hyde Park, I don t mind buffet breakfast but having stayed at other Hilton hotels i much prefer hot fresh tea and coffee served to the table Having hot flasks of water on the end of the buffet tables was naff People open the flasks to pour the water and forget to fasten them then the water goes cold It may be expected in the Travel Lodge to mess about with water flasks to get your own drink but not the Hilton This could be improved , Breakfast was good room was nice and the bed extra comfy Bathroom small but practical I like the Hilton chain if something is not right they will get it sorted right away 
42673,Hilton London Hyde Park, Didn t like that I had to pay 100 deposit as wasn t aware of this We were entitled to free wifi however when clicking on it it was asking us to pay This wasn t explained very well it was only after speaking to a second member of staff she said the payment will be cancelled from our bill , Croissants and pan au chocolates were amazing The room was modern and had everything you needed however on the very small side 
42674,Hilton London Hyde Park, Bed could have been softer , Location was ideal to getting out and about London The staff was wonderful They attended to our needs with a smile Breakfast was the best Couldn t have asked for a better place to start and end our day 
42675,Hilton London Hyde Park, The hotel has very poor security because there is no CCTV camera at the corridors Our carry on luggages zips are broken and the hotel couldn t provide neither satisfiable nor reasonable investigation for us , Location
42676,Hilton London Hyde Park, The bed was uncomfortable there wasn t a view the light fuse tripped leaving us in the dark for a while no towel rail the building was tired looking , The location was lovely staff were very friendly 
42677,Hilton London Hyde Park, Was at the front of the Hotel and you could hear the traffic through the night so if you want quiet go for a bedroom at the rear of the hotel , The bedroom was light and airy
42678,Hilton London Hyde Park, Very little added extra luxury considering it is a Hilton hotel Have stayed in Hilton before and the added extras made all the difference nothing like that with this hotel , The breakfast was lovely fresh and tasty The staff at breakfast were friendly and helpful 
42679,Hilton London Hyde Park, Just some stains on the carpet that shows the room is not well kept Other than that any problem we had with the room was addressed immediately internet was a bit slow you have to be a hilton member to get a free wifi access , This is our second stay at the same hotel within a year The location is great just across kensington garden and bayswater has a lot of eateries that opens late The hotel is also next to queensway station few stops away from city centre We got to check in earlier with a bit of top up The staff were helpful 
42680,Hilton London Hyde Park, The food of breakfast is the same everyday Not much choises and feel boring on the food after 2 days stay , The location is very convenience to reach tube restaurants and shopping outlets 
42681,Hilton London Hyde Park, It didn t mention anywhere in the booking that this room was in the basement and there were no windows which I thought was misleading to be fair though it really wasn t a problem and didn t ruin our experience , Family room was extremely spacious and comfortable but the bath was the icing on the cake it was huge Although the hotel is right next door to the tube didn t really hear any noise so well soundproofed Everyone on reception were lovely and very helpful Stayed at many hotels in London this one is definitely my favourite 
42682,Hilton London Hyde Park, The size of the room in this Hilton was small We had together our first room changed as we were unhappy with the cleanliness , The location was very good right beside the underground and opposite Hyde Park 
42683,Hilton London Hyde Park, Road outside very noisy all night Cars rode over a loose manhole cover that kept me awake Probably a listed building so can t have double glazing but double glazed secondary would be a huge help , Bed comfortable Bathroom clean and nicely done if a little small shower could be more powerful Great location to the tube 
42684,Hilton London Hyde Park, Booking romantic night for a couple with breakfast should be obvious that breakfast for two is required and not just for one person Apart of extra cost it was a disappointment, The room was prepared as romantic turndown it was really nice
42685,Hilton London Hyde Park, Housekeeper didn t clean well the room and toilet Housekeeper s hair was on the toilet and tissue was wet with water, The reception staff were nice
42686,Hilton London Hyde Park, Seems all rooms didn t work well for me the 1st one room 506 the heater didn t work the second one 509 was very small the last one 319 was something wrong with the electricity it went off the whole room in the night so I had to bring my baby out from the room , The care and helpful Gabriel he found us a room with a better heater after a very cold night in room 506 
42687,Hilton London Hyde Park, the woman who checked us out was rude and cold with poor communication skills, The woman who checked me in was lovely she was nice enough to give us a free upgrade 
42688,Hilton London Hyde Park, I was asked for a 50 pound refundable deposit which still has not been debited back the my account which it was debited from , Location of hotel was perfect located next to tube station for easy access to city centre Will reccommend and book for our next city break 
42689,Hilton London Hyde Park,No Negative, Staff is excellent Location is excellent Breakfast is excellent Interior and external design is excellent Rooms are so comfort Room sight was to Hyde Park What else Price versus all said is excellent

42691,Hilton London Hyde Park, Room were quite small but adequate , Fantastic location Right across the road from Hyde Park close to 2 tube stations Bayswater and Queensway We were upgraded for free as we were on honeymoon 
42692,Hilton London Hyde Park, No wifi at that price really poor a bill under door For room service and a phone call to come own from my room to pay never in my life has that happ wasn t impressed we won t be back at was expensive but quite unprofessional , Location

42694,Hilton London Hyde Park, VIEW Room 224 scaffolding from one window and weeds in pots accompanied by drain pipes from the other however we lived with this as it was shortest days of the year and dark most of the time so not much to see anyway but would like to have known beforehand , Location staff cleanliness facilities in the room We were there for access to most things LONDON in this area but in particular Winter Wonderland which was fantastic as was it s security cleanliness and presentation Well done London 
42695,Hilton London Hyde Park, You had to pay an extra deposit when you got to the hotel Even though you got this back it I wasn t informed about it till I get there , How friendly and helpful the staff were Also the location as it was only a 20 minute walk to winter wonderland and Queensway tube station was literally a 20 second walk so Oxford street and shopping was easily assessable 
42696,Hilton London Hyde Park, our room wasn t ready until 3 45, Location for our visit was perfect train station next door Our room was excellent view over park Bathroom very clean Only thing that could have improved room was a little more tea milk A Christmas tree in reception bar would have been nice to see
42697,Hilton London Hyde Park, No biscuits on the tea tray Breakfast was fair thought the dining area could have done with a polish generally the hotel was adequate perhaps a little faded Staff were polite and courteous,No Positive
42698,Hilton London Hyde Park, We were upgraded to a king room and it wasn t the biggest so wander what the standard doubles were like , The location was brilliant right on the central line into centre of London and on Hyde park for winter wonderland Restaurant downstairs was very nice too 
42699,Hilton London Hyde Park, The staff don t good and don t answer you when you call for help and no enough water and no restroom facilities and when you ask him for any thing they told you you are not member in hilton club, The place of hotel
42700,Hilton London Hyde Park, Staff where unattentive unhelpful and unfriendly Considering I d just come from the Dorchester I was expecting some kind of Christmas theme as I was visiting around the holiday period There was not a Christmas tree insight Unfortunately the temperature of the room was uncontrollable Not value for money , The room was small clean and adequate with an amazing view

42702,Hilton London Hyde Park, Do not be confused This is a Hilton But it does not look like a Hilton Old building need to be renovated , Next to the Queensway tube station Clean 
42703,Hilton London Hyde Park, I found the room to be very dark due to lack of natural light and the general lighting I found the overall finish to the decor and bathroom to be very poor It wasn t what I expected for the money I was charged , I liked the restaurant and the breakfast was good I found the room service very good too 
42704,Hilton London Hyde Park, the room we were put in was so noisy we could not sleep the main large air pipe was out side the room window which only had second glazing sounded like jumbo jet the breakfast was freezing cold the hot plate you could put your hand on it freezing cold the bread slices were rock hard only 2 slices out of 10 were ok the toaster was so slow to toast the staff give no instructions on coffee etc you at to work it out yourselves e g self service no cutlery on table or available at to borrow my wife s teaspoon asked staff i got ignored the signs on appliances were unreadable especially hot a cold colour code was the smallest spec the shower control handles had no signs at all was trying to find which tap did what for 5 mins the coffee machine instructions were so small we at to take a picture on the phone to enlarge to read the heating control did not respond we were freezing , the Hilton receptionist were excellent and tried to resolve the situation the room was changed to a quiet room the location was excellent

42708,Hilton London Hyde Park, The beds were uncomfortable and so wet the pillows therefore we had to ask for more Also the lamp didn t work and the access to the shower wasn t good therefore injuring my heel and causing it to bleed quite badly when trying to get in the bath , The location to Queensway tube station was perfect and also to Kensington palace 
42709,Hilton London Hyde Park,No Negative, Very convenient location in a close proximity to Queensway and Bayswater tube stations Very helpful staff I was staying for 7 nights and my 1st room had a rather bleak view into the inner yard I ve asked at the reception to be moved into a room with the park view and the next day I was given a room with a great view of Hyde park 
42710,Hilton London Hyde Park, The smell of the room, Alejandra Torres the Italian COlombian receptionist was very professional and welcoming I travelled from Paris early in the morning I was exhausted but she was very quick and extremely accurate to make me feel at home

42716,Hilton London Hyde Park, The price for the Breakfast was moderately expensive given that a similar Breakfast can be had at a nearby Cafe for less than half the price At the next Renovation Consideration should be made to upgrade the street facing rooms to a Quieter window package As is there is lots of noise from the Busy Street even late at night with cars and big trucks driving by , Liked the Location nearby the Underground station Good proximity to Hyde park far enough away from the Major Attractions to be away from the large Tourists Crowds

42723,Hilton London Hyde Park, Staff attentiveness Calls to reception or front desk are never picked up Have to go down and talk to the staff personally to ask simple things because phones are not answered Also we requested for a taxi for 5 30pm in the afternoon to the airport The staff called us and woke us up from sleep at 5 15am in the morning to tell us taxi has arrived He then apologized of course But mistakes like these can be avoided , Amazing Location Will come back here definitely just for the location It is just next to the tube With a bus stop so close Hyde Park is just opposite And rows of restaurants and shops just around the corner 
42724,Hilton London Hyde Park, The lobby is a bit small when you imagine Hilton but considering its central London it can be waived , Location in terms of food and travel convenience as in close proximity of Queensway and Bayswater tube station

42729,Hilton London Hyde Park, The milk in the room had gone off It didn t make for a good cup of tea At breakfast couldn t find any cups or spoons Didn t like the tea out of the flask It would be better just to supply tea bags and hot water , The loication of the hotel was good The room and bathroom were spacious 
42730,Hilton London Hyde Park, just one staff was rude and forgot that i came to check in She left and never attended us wifi is only provided for HHonors members You can register when you arrived there , The location is right infront of the entrance of diana princess of wales playground my son goes there every day Queensway station is just next to the hotel bus service no 94 infront of the hotel goes to oxford street and the opposite station goes to sheperd bush bus 70 goes to south kensington Really convenient

42735,Hilton London Hyde Park, The staff are great But they are probably understaffed hence it takes a while , The location was amazing Right around the corner from our favourite lobster noodles restaurant and right next to the Queensway tube station Unbeatable convenience Awesome room with view of park is a huge bonus 
42736,Hilton London Hyde Park, There was works going on inside the building which resulted in noise and messiness The room and bathroom were too small for price I paid queen size room also the rooms were dated and definitely need some work the cleanliness in the rooms waster done to its best as my rooms was never hovered while I stayed there , The bed was comfy And staff were helpful
42737,Hilton London Hyde Park, Because of the work going on there was a mess at the entrance and very cramped The bathroom was very small and very little space to walk around in the room , Location was great 
42738,Hilton London Hyde Park, If you are claustrophobic and travelling solo ask for a bigger room than the usual single one eg Room No 602 Kind of small Moreover the reconstruction works which take place on the ground floor makes the hotel s entrance really dull and completely uninteresting Nevertheless and based on the pictures of the future renovation it is going to be a really nice place , It is literally adjacent to the underground station Central Line which makes it really easy to commute to wherever you want around London
42739,Hilton London Hyde Park, Room could have been a little bigger Shower was awful not powerful at all quite difficult to wash your hair , Loved the d cor in restaurant and bar Breakfast was lovely and food in restaurant really good Staff also very efficient

42769,Hilton London Hyde Park, At check in they demand a GBP50 deposit which they reserve on your credit debet card Why they do that is a mystery to me I suppose it is for minibar use and people not paying for it My room did not even have a minibar What they don t tell you is that you won t have the money released at check out after later calling the hotel it turns out this takes at least 5 days and they blame the bank for that This is absolutely ridiculous Another thing is that the bathtub was full of hairs which is disgusting and towels have black spots and haris on them They were also old worn out Luckily there were enough towels so I could use the best one There is no coffee tea station at the breakfast buffet instead somebody walks around with a coffee pot The coffee clearly had been standing al long time and tasted horrible For the price I had to pay for one night it is a robbery I will never ever come back and would never recommend this to anybody I know , The location is allright because it is near the larger parks
