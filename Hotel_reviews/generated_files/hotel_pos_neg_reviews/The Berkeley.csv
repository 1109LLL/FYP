512545,The Berkeley, We only had one night and would have loved to stay longer , The Berkeley is the most wonderful place to stay in London The staff especially the doormen always give us the best welcome 
512546,The Berkeley, The roof garden is a little bijoux Head up early if the sun breaks through , It s not like London Things work Staff are professional It s clean It s spacious The food is excellent You get looked after It s genius 
512547,The Berkeley, Check in was delayed by 3 5 hrs after complaining twice the duty manager sorted it and then made a big effort to try to make our stay perfect sadly the initial issues did leave their mark A shame as everything else was amazing, Restaurant staff were excellent
512548,The Berkeley,No Negative, The very warm and friendly staff who made anything possible with a smile The afternoon tea was amazing a true once in your life experience That we will remember and talk about for a long time 
512549,The Berkeley, Unfortunately we were disturbed by some renovation works occurring in the room above us however we received a 50 discount as a gesture of the hotels appreciation and understanding of our experience being compromised , The restaurant was excellent in the lobby area and the breads and pastries were authentic in the way they tasted etc We also got an upgrade as a returning gues which was very much appreciated too Location of the property is superb we always get a room facing the Church 
512550,The Berkeley, Price is rather high but it is value for money The hotel is rebuilding and sometimes the sound of a pneumatic hammer is disturbing at 8 o clock AM in the weekend , Great facilities Perfect staff and delicious breakfast Music in the bar a bit too loud to our liking 
512551,The Berkeley, Awful level of attentiveness of reception staff Clearly did not want to check us in when we arrived Not friendly all rather snooty Felt most unwelcome , Good food in room service
512552,The Berkeley, The room was on last floor very small and air conditioning not working I did book a de lux room overlooking the park as I did every time not the one they gave me ,No Positive
512553,The Berkeley, The bar could be larger as seating was a bit limited or a bit brighter with perhaps softer music, The staff were very friendly and a great location for London shopping
512554,The Berkeley, The loud decoration in the lobby Too many tables in the dining outlets So crowded , The efficiency of the concierge and the location The pool area should be made more comfortable by place some round tables for guests to have breakfast and lunch 
512555,The Berkeley, My room was on the 6th floor at the end of the corridor and I was told it was a quiet room however this was defiantly not true It was next to the service area for the 6th floor with clattering and banging from the service area and the swinging door right next to my bed headboard meant I was woken up from 6 am If you are given one of these rooms ask to be moved immediately what is annoying is that these issues could easily be solved with better sound proofing anyway as for me I ll be back staying at the Bulgari hotel next time I m in London I would have stayed their but they were full , The room and staff were nice
512556,The Berkeley, Nothing a fine standard for all fie star hotels to aspire too, The staff had the best balance of friendliness and service that I have ever experienced plus the food was sublime even in the bar 
512557,The Berkeley, For this kind of price and a 5 star hotel really a big disappointment 1 the shower in our room was 1 50m high and situated in our bath after asking for a normal shower because I m 2 meter and couldn t shower The staff said that s your problem but if you want to pay more we can give you a room with a walk in shower 2 The two rooms we saw were both very dated 3 No one was taking care of the entrance or was taking the entrance serious We had to arrange our luggage ourself and even the taxi s we arranged ourself after two times no help with the taxi s we decided to use our uber app from that moment which suddenly suddenly wasn t appreciated by the doormen It was an unpleasant surprise especially because we came back after two years because we liked the hotel our first stay very much and had our first anniversary there ,No Positive
512558,The Berkeley, Service is lacklustre Was told they would send a cappuccino when I checked in but it never arrived Had to ask twice for a plastic bag for my washing , Not much Gym area okay 
512559,The Berkeley,No Negative, We chose this hotel as we were eating at Marcus Wareing s restaurant that evening Therefore the location was excellent The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the room was very comfortable 
512560,The Berkeley, First what Made me very unhappy is that there is renovation going on and this should have been somehow informed by hotel or by booking web site or at least have discounted rate Breakfast overpriced although good quality No nespresso machine or tea in room not big deal but for such price could be included Hotel not bad but definately overpriced If you are expecting something cool and super luxury it is not it and will not make any difference if you choose a good 4 star hotel but way cheaper Be careful when booking they will charge you extra taxes on everything room price food etc which will make your total bill look surprising i guess it is common around some London hotels and restaurants my bill per day became 450 gbp with breakfast for 2persons instead of 295 booked So If you don t care about money go for some higher price hotels like four seasons Dorchester or Jumeirah as there you feels real 5 star , Really a perfect location to start tour walk around tour Spa zone really nice Comfortable bed and room in general Service and staff better then other 5star hotels 
512561,The Berkeley, The place was a building site This was not made obvious before booking There seemed to be building works going on all over the hotel including painting and decorating Should have attracted a discount as substantially interfered with enjoyment of the place , Good Egyptian sheets on bed
512562,The Berkeley, Very expensive Especially breakfast way too many people next to swimming pool and too many children , Very stylish hotel Has its unique personal style excellent personnel Very high quality however has unique personality not just a standard 5 hotel
512563,The Berkeley,No Negative, The hotel is quiet but feels very luxurious yet close to everything i loved the rooms are up to date very nice decor and comfortable beds could sleep there forever the staff very friendly and cheerful its my new favorite hotel in London
512564,The Berkeley, Whilst I had a generous upgrade I d have preferred more light view The attic studios are spacious but small windows , Location is fabulous for running in Hyde Park shopping catching up with friends Loved the personal touch and upgrades when the staff knew it was my birthday thank you so much I m an efficient female solo traveller so I like the nice comfortable feminine touches but I also don t want to be over whelmed with staff over attending me and the team here knew the fine balance of great efficient service to suit my needs within a day of my stay 
512565,The Berkeley, It s an amazing Boutique Hotel, Waleed The Manager is amazing always makes my stay memorable And the stuff is always amazing Each everyone of them 
512566,The Berkeley, The room wasn t the same as that depicted in the photos on the website the decor did seem older but still very clean and nice just not quite as contemporary , The best breakfast of any hotel I have ever stayed in All food lunch and afternoon tea were both incredibly good although expensive but that s to be expected The staff were all very friendly especially those at reception 
512567,The Berkeley, I got a quiet room it looked like a prison Got a different room size is super but it was very old all the way from elevator to the room Connection doors were too noisy , Free friendly and helpful staff may be best I ever seen in Eourpe And I know that they are not faking it 
512568,The Berkeley, It s one of our favourtie place to stay in London and we have stayed there before but on this trip they had constructions from 10am 6pm and the breakfast area windows were all covered i would not have stayed there if i knew and there was no mention on the site that they had the construction we were very disappointed this time They should have been transparent,No Positive
512569,The Berkeley, Location goes through a major refit so The Blue Bar was closed entrance was a little bit weird didn t tell before, Room and bath were nice but overpriced
512570,The Berkeley, Obviously we would have preferred that there had been no refurbishment but the staff bent over backwards to accommodate us We were well taken care of , The rooms were perfect and quiet even with some hotel refurbishment going on Beds were heavenly and the bathrooms were luxurious I also loved the gym and the pool and the breakfast in Koffman s was sublime A real oasis from the hustle and bustle It was my best hotel stay in London and I have stayed at The Dorchester and The Savoy Quiet elegant understated and perfect 
512571,The Berkeley, The constructions around these days no coffee tools in the room I had , Size of the room Gym equipment swimming pool great location friendly staff pleased services and internet speed
512572,The Berkeley, Unfortunately there were refurbishments ongoing but this couldn t be helped and the staff compensated for this slight inconvenience , The staff were incredibly helpful the service exceptional and the room was perfect 
512573,The Berkeley, I stayed there for 5 nights and the TV was not working for 3 nights Staff responsed fast for my call once they fixed that night it was not working again in the morning this fixing kept repeating for 3 night until the very last night it was being fixed , Excellent breakfast friendly staff
512574,The Berkeley,No Negative, Excellent location for fine shopping Efficient friendly staff especially helpful doormen Comfortable rooms and good bathrooms First rate breakfast 
512575,The Berkeley, I wish I stayed longer , Everything One of the best hotels I ve ever seen I love the room design the professional polite staff excellent services The food was super delicious like it is home made Cozy welcoming atmosphere 
512576,The Berkeley, The front of the hotel is being renovated inside and out We were NOT aware of this and would not have booked our stay if we had been There is no main bar lounge etc It is very noisy inside and outside the hotel between 10 and 5 each day According to a sign the works will finish in June 2016 , Excellent service from first contact with the front door staff to check in and throughout our stay Dinner at Pierre Koffmans Highly recommended 
512577,The Berkeley,No Negative, Comfortable beds lovely decor helpful staff delicious in room menu with impeccable presentation Great area for antique heads and close to Harrods food hall and Hyde Park 
512578,The Berkeley,No Negative, The hotel is in a perfect location in the centre of it all Most of all though the staff treat you as you are the most special people visiting and I can imagine that they do this for all guests 
512579,The Berkeley,No Negative, I booked the Berkeley for my son and his partner and they were hugely impressed We are so glad because the Berkeley is one of our favourite spots in the world 
512580,The Berkeley, rooms smelled of tobacco we had 2 rooms badly behaved children playing Tig at breakfast and another watching a film on his ipad really loudly but staff seemed too afraid to ask parents to control their children hence every normally behaved child was staring at them and adults were irritated SHOULD HAVE SOME GROUNDRULES FOR DINING ROOM for the benefit of other paying customers, swimming pool with retractable roof rooms very comfortable staff very pleasant
