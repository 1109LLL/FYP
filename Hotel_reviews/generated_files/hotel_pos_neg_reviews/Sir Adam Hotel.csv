393810,Sir Adam Hotel, Noisy doors and plumbing no direct access to lobby from parking not so clean bathroom Airco control panel hidden behind furniture and difficult to adjust, great location across Central Train station
393811,Sir Adam Hotel, Everything was lovely, Everything was Superb Definitely liked the atmosphere view and warm welcome Loved the room especially the record player and great music collection
393812,Sir Adam Hotel, The restaurant has burgers mainly would appreciate a bit more choices especially for diner The bathroom is actually in the room except toilet and shower so it is not so practical not to wake up the other person , nice decoration nice view very modern hotel Nice staff I appreciated the fruits and pastries available at the reception 
393813,Sir Adam Hotel,No Negative, Was a boom Wanted to stay here sone year ago bot was not opened yet We stayed one night and after we took another 2 nights we are still here Great value for the money a really nice hotel We come in Amsterdam like 3 times a year and from now on we will surely stay only here Beautiful design of the room the music the view and of course The Butcher as a breakfast restaurant Awesomeeee 
393814,Sir Adam Hotel, The loudness of the air conditining system Water from the shower was driping into the room , The view on the city centre paid extra The design of the hotel was surprising Almost no noise from the outside 
393815,Sir Adam Hotel, Should have had free access to the rooftop attraction breakfast was a bit disorganised rooms weren t the biggest, Traveling across on the free ferry was great fun hotel was cool lots of arcade games and table tennis
393816,Sir Adam Hotel, They didn t check me in the type of room I booked and they said it s same room and it s not They charge double in the credit card and they charge me for things I didn t take from mini bar , Breakfast is good AC very noise small room over pricing 
393817,Sir Adam Hotel, They charge me double on my credit cards and they said they will returns it but until now they didn t 950 on they check out they charge for things I didn t take it from the min bar , Location and hotel entrance 
393818,Sir Adam Hotel, Nothing really quite bang for the buck , Where can I start counting the pro s really Fabulous decoration good location delicious burger place at the ground floor butcher record player in the room helpful staff 70 s disco style elevators and fluffy bed Finding this place was a coincidence but I can definitely recommend it to any music lover 
393819,Sir Adam Hotel, Necessity to pay to benefit from the view Expansive parking Uggly view from the room Common areas are really noisy, Nice brunch Beautifull design Nice welcome by personnel
393820,Sir Adam Hotel, Entrance to the hotel was hard to fondness but it wasn t fun The building it self has a lot fe activities but nobody told me about them until I checked out It could have been better if the staff presented while checking in Aesthetics were taken into consideration over function in general like there is no hangers near the shower , Although the service is slow the food would erase that thought totally The ambiance isn t a typical 4 star hotel and the quality is even better than most 5 stars hotels Everybody understands and speak English very well location is perfect Next to the ferry free where the central bus train subway station Amazing view to Amsterdam a and the River Sound proof guest rooms Nice elevator which will get you to your floor in no time You don t need to bring everything with you as the room Ian equipped with music player guitar rob you can buy anything you like in your bedroom the bed is extremely comfy super clean I m over sensitive about hygiene food is a must try 
393821,Sir Adam Hotel, The weekend was very hot the aircon was working overtime and very very noisy The staff were amazing very helpful and friendly but communication was lacking Book breakfast here and it will be a better deal we went down for breakfast the first day sorry you are not down for breakfast Ok so can we order and charge to our room they called reception and they said no breakfast included That is not what we were asking If this hotel gets a few communication problems sorted this place will be first class This was our 6th hotel stop in a 14 stay around Europe holiday The places that communicate well and what they say is done for you are the best , The room was very funky ultra modern a must for music lovers
393822,Sir Adam Hotel, Minor critism but the pillows were too big and therefore uncomfortable , It was a quirky modern hotel the themed lifts were fun It was clean and the location was fabulous 
393823,Sir Adam Hotel, Food in Butchers bar was okay not great, Bed superbly comfy The bar and club are very noisy but couldn t really hear it in my room with my ear plugs so I was very happy very early check out good taxi ordering very good Food in Butchers bar was okay not great
393824,Sir Adam Hotel, Downside It got very dusty very fast The bed side tables shelves and other surfaces always seemed dusty during our 4 night stay even after house keeping or maybe it just accumulated soon after due to the ventilation not sure why , Amazing bed and pillows Cute welcome as it was our honeymoon The room was tiny but tastefully decorated and super comfy plus a nice TV and record player Overall it s a trendy and chic hotel carefully designed for the young at heart 
393825,Sir Adam Hotel,No Negative, The extra blanket on the bed was the softest dreamiest blanket I have ever know Also the welcoming card was lovely just the whole theme was incredibly fun 
393826,Sir Adam Hotel, Nothing this is a great place to have fun , The decor was elegant yet cool the elevators with the disco ball was just great The prosecco at arrival without a formal check in desk was great Many small and quirky touches but the LP player in the room was just an outstanding idea The linen decor and overall experience was great 
393827,Sir Adam Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is designed with care and passion Everything is very modern and rooms are clean The staff is very friendly Located directly opposite to the main station it is very central and with the ferry operating very frequently 24 7 the city center is reachable within 10 minutes Rental bikes are available at the front desk 
393828,Sir Adam Hotel, Can be a bit noisy on weekends through live music from the bar downstairs, Staff is super friendly and very service oriented Top location Rooms having great view 
393829,Sir Adam Hotel, The host lady at the lookout restaurant is not polite at all There is room for improvement for the staff there I also didn t like that although we were hotel guests we had to pay an extra of 18 Euros to go to the roof of the hotel while the swings are also charged for an extra of 5 euros , Fantastic location The hotel s ambience and music concept are amazing 
393830,Sir Adam Hotel, I was charged extra for the luxuy gift when we claimed that we took nothing from the room The luxury gift was addressed to toiletries They were all secured in the bathroom with their own inbuilt system 76 00 was charged above the room charges wothout informing me Not happy , The room was awesome I loved it 
393831,Sir Adam Hotel, The air conditioning conked out halfway through the night and started to make a terrible grinding noise so we had to switch it off The breakfast selection is a little odd for a Brit I mean the pastries are delicious and I also had 2 scrambled eggs with pancetta but for 21 each it s a bit pricey I didn t fancy vine leaves and courgettes really , I loved the view from the room and the facilities were very good You can stream from your phone to the TV there s a record player and some vinyl to listen to Illy coffee pods and a machine are provided The general area is lovely very vibrant but not too hectic Very easy to get to as there s a free 24 7 ferry from Central Station The staff are great really helpful The rooms are interesting it s basically like being in a large poured concrete cage with floor to ceiling windows even in the shower The bed was comfortable I informed the staff we were on a trip to celebrate our anniversary and they covered the bed in plastic rose petals and wrote us a note which I thought was very sweet 
393832,Sir Adam Hotel, Had a little trouble while checking in due to a large number of guests But in general all was ok Would definitely stay again in this Hotel , The BED I don t remember the last time when I have slept so well It is literally a heaven bed The view from my window was definitely a bonus to the perfect bed The room ambiance would make you want to stay more Plus you have amazing toiletries the shampoo shower gel etc made by one of the local brands the only thing hotel might want to reconsider it is their price when people ask to purchase those it is unbelievably high even for its quality 
393833,Sir Adam Hotel, Service at breakfast tended to be a bit erratic great one day tardy the next, Some of the rooms have fantastic views over the IJ river I asked for this in my special requests and got a room with a view when I checked in 
393834,Sir Adam Hotel, Restaurant service was slow and food quality not that great maybe they were having an off day the room service only offered burger type food which put me off But the hotel itself is fabulous and you can reach all the central amsterdam restaurants easily there s construction going on next door and my room faced straight onto construction workers and machinery doing their stuff woke me up on a bank holiday day so ask for a room away from all that , Front office staff were fantastic as is the design of the hotel Big pictures of Bowie and Dylan on the walls greet you as you walk in The 1 minute ferry ride to Central station was brilliant 
393835,Sir Adam Hotel, Black colored walls are scary not cool Expensive as all accommodations in Amsterdam , Design hotel if you like pop culture Many ultra cool details such as turntable gramophones with LP in your room my room had an electric guitar as decoration Good breakfast
393836,Sir Adam Hotel, The bar staff should pay a lot more attention to guests around the bar They seemed quite involved with each other while letting guests wait for their drinks , The room was absolutely awesome It is decorated from a music artistic perspective With cool art and objects in the room There even is an entire selection of vinyl from which you can pick your favourites to play in your room The room itself had a great view over the Amsterdam IJ river Just the view alone is worth it Furthermore it is also worthy to note that this hotel is situated just across the river from Central Station You can take the 24 7 365 days a year free ferry which only takes 2 minutes into the center of Amsterdam 
393837,Sir Adam Hotel,No Negative, Staff were amazing and very helpful nothing was to much trouble The hotel is very secure Great selection of vinyl for you to take to your room Great city views 
393838,Sir Adam Hotel, Very loud music at night in ground and first flour during weekends and special holidays, All Staff at the reception were of assistance around the clock Rub Sandra special appreciation 
393839,Sir Adam Hotel, The Air cond was a tad on the noisey side, Always a nice feeling coming back into the room and getting a smile on your face the extra level of detail in the room was great loved the record player and found several old LPs from the past that will always remind us of our stay at Sir Adam
393840,Sir Adam Hotel, One of the lights in our room wasn t working and the room was warm despite the airconditioning being on its lowest and on all night although the warmth may also have been due to the thick duvet , Friendly staff and clear music theme with a gramophone player in our room and music references everywhere The food was tasty and available all night which was great as we came back late in need of a snack Excellent shower and the hand wash shower gel shampoo smelt very nice 
393841,Sir Adam Hotel, Rooms are small and some of the features take a bit of time to adapt to but ideally suited for a short visit to Amsterdam, Sir A dam is a rather quirky hotel based around a modern 60 s theme It is well equipped and located across the main canal from Amsterdam Central Station free continuous ferries cross the canal While there is not a lot in the immediate vicinity of the hotel Amsterdam is a 5 min walk ferry ride away Staff were friendly and helpful 
393842,Sir Adam Hotel, The receptionist who has checked me in and checked me out did not have a training how to welcome guests for a hotel which asks 300EUR night this is really bad The hotel is very basic but close to my office Bathroom is also very basic For the same price one can also overnight in Sofitel The Legend much better hotel close to the central station For 200 EUR appr one could overnight in art otel excellent service breakfast bed location close to the central station So honestly I will not return to Sir Adam , Breakfast and bed are very good 
393843,Sir Adam Hotel, Would be nice to provide a toothbrush and toothpaste while the other perks of the room are nice I definitely needed a toothbrush more than music when i first got there and it s a ferry trip to the nearest shops I would probably not request the car from the airport next time It is really easy to get there by train and then ferry and much cheaper , I love the record players in all the rooms Very modern hotel friendly staff I was travelling alone but was able to come downstairs and be chatting to staff or other guests within minutes I loved getting on the free ferry everyday to Amsterdam Central especially when the weather was nice I had a great time here for my first trip to Amsterdam
393844,Sir Adam Hotel, Nothing It was a great stay , Superb experience from the friendly staff the disco lift the music themed rooms the very comfortable beds excellent water pressure numerous cool touches throughout And just a very short and convenient ferry ride from the center of town 
393845,Sir Adam Hotel, Nothing loved it all , Absolutely brilliant from check in the room which was fantastic won t reveal all the staff the concept ooh not to forget the amazing lifts we liked C the best we could not fault anything We took the free ferry backwards and forwards each day DON T be put off by the location it s superb the ferry runs every few minutes it s just outside central station and the otherside it s a 1 min walk to the hotel This location gets you out of all the mayhem with a simply brilliant view of the river and we sat and people watched The Sir Adam is a vibrant but modern and excellent place to unwind after a day of sight seeing The staff were so helpful and booked us a taxi for a restaurant and the hotel the driver met us inside the hotel took us to the car If I visit Amsterdam again we will most certainly stay here again Thank you for a wonderful stay 
393846,Sir Adam Hotel, Cheaper breakfast or included in price More vinyl current as well as old music Better extraction in shower WC, Lifts Welcome by Raymond Quirky View Sound proofing couldn t hear corridors music etc in rooms Comfy beds hot powerful showers
393847,Sir Adam Hotel, Rooms rather small Food in the Madam restaurant top floor splendid view rather mediocre , Fantastic view close to Amsterdam center just a short ferry trip away For those who like vinyl records that s the place to be 
393848,Sir Adam Hotel, Nothing but beware of the showers if you don t have the right angle on the head you could end up with a lake in your room , Great atmosphere great staff great location great hotel couldn t fault it really So happy we chose this hotel for my 30th and hope to visit again soon Thank you again 
393849,Sir Adam Hotel,No Negative, Great location Brilliant staff who gave us some really good tips on hip places to eat and visit Nice touch with the old vinyl record selection Enjoyable stay 
393850,Sir Adam Hotel,No Negative, I loved everything about this hotel we travelled to celebrate my daughter s 18th birthday and the staff left a message on the mirror and left her a birthday card and some sweets which was a lovely touch I booked this hotel because of the music theme and this didn t disappoint The staff were lovely from start to finish We ordered room service from The Butchershop late one night and the food came quickly and was delicious This is a funky cool hotel and as my daughter said Its a hotel with personality We loved and would definitely go back If you are considering this hotel please book it immediately if only to see the amazing elevators Thank you so much to everyone at Sir A dam xxx
393851,Sir Adam Hotel, The location was a bit tricky to find due to the construction, I liked room decoration and security also staff were very friendly and helpful the access to the central station by ferry was excellent 24 hours a day
393852,Sir Adam Hotel, the food menu there weren t many American staples that i might enjoy i e bacon and eggs, i loved the vibe and location of the hotel to the areas of the city i traveled to
393853,Sir Adam Hotel, The room was a bit small but the view makes up for that, This is a really nice addition to the more main stream hotels in Amsterdam staying in Sir Adam is an experience in itself Staff is professional yet very kind breakfast is excellent and the elevators are a must see
393854,Sir Adam Hotel, Although breakfast was great it took ages for a member of staff to come and take our order , The full English breakfast at The Butcher was the best breakfast we ve had since visiting Amsterdam The bed was so comfy and all facilities were modern and clean The staff were so accommodating and as we were visiting for my boyfriend s birthday they put balloons and upgraded our room which was thoughtful The hotel is very secure and you needed an access key card to go to all of the rooms 
393855,Sir Adam Hotel, Nothing, VERY modern hotel lots of fun activities available from games to free music bars they even host events Location was perfect to be away from the grunge and crowds of Amsterdam but close enough to access it quickly 
393856,Sir Adam Hotel, Only half our food service order arrived my burger chips were missing asked for sauces never got any of that either At breakfast after starving my mushrooms were raw the beans were cold the sausages undercooked the egg burnt all on one plate Total disaster with the food Really dissapointed underwhelmed with the whole experience There was also Massive brown hair on the shower wall also where me my partner don t have brown hair we both noticed that it hadn t been removed the whole weekend ,No Positive
393857,Sir Adam Hotel, Room decor was so bad Window was tiny and blocked w all kind of interior No hot water in the morning and plumper enter the room rite after knock not even wait for response Isolation was so bad icould heart noises from people walking on heels upstair and ventilation machine And they charged full price with a unsincere sorry after hearing the complain , Room decor was so bad Window was tiny and blocked w all kind of interior No hot water in the morning and plumper enter the room rite after knock not even wait for response Isolation was so bad icould heart noises from people walking on heels upstair and ventilation machine And they charged full price with a unsincere sorry after hearing the complain 
393858,Sir Adam Hotel, None of that, Excellent place Modern design nice view from panoramic windows comfortable bed viewpoint on top if the hotel and tasty burgers And fish and chips which you can get in the restaurant downstairs there are 2 more in the building Next time we are in Amsterdam we will stop here for sure
393859,Sir Adam Hotel, Breakfast was a nightmare had to wait 20 minutes for the first cup of coffee even longer for the second one Endless waiting for eggs from menu served cold and stale Bread gf diet came when we were leaving approx after an hour Surprisingly there seemed to be enough servers Apologies did not make the experience any better very bad breakfast for 21 euro , Great location amazing view very friendly staff We felt welcome from the first moment and loved the concept Comfortable beds coffee tea facilities binoculars great idea Very modern new clean 
393860,Sir Adam Hotel, Coffee very sour cold boiled eggs for breakfast no service in the lobby seating area that parking is not included in the room rate Rooms look very funky for the first 5 then all seems very cluttered and small , Rooms have a nice view Quick check in the ladies serving breakfast 
393861,Sir Adam Hotel, I paid more than the deal I booked through booking com The bed sheets have given me a rash all over my body Every time we ordered food it was served cold, Staff were nice overall vibe of the hotel was cool
393862,Sir Adam Hotel, The parking cost is a bit steep You have to park downstairs as there are no public options around 35 euro is a bit steep for hotel guests They should perhaps offer a package , Amazing view very nice atmosphere Personal reception Compimentary prosecco and beer jenever shots and bottle of water in the room Bed is fantastdc so is the shower And view is so amazing we slept with roll curtains up 
393863,Sir Adam Hotel, I can t think of anything , What a wonderful location with great views of the hustle and bustle just a leisurely ferry ride minutes across from central station We loved the entourage cool and contemporary with the most comfortable beds we slept in in a while The staff were very welcoming and my husband was very impressed with the gym They even offer group lessons and personal trainers We definitely reccomend staying here 
393864,Sir Adam Hotel, Restaurant plastic plates in the restaurant for the salad Portions are a bit small for those who are hungry missing variety in the menu Overall atmosphere in the restaurant and hall very stylish but a bit cold from my POV, Very helpful and friendly staff Nice idea with the record players in the room Great beds very comfortable
393865,Sir Adam Hotel,No Negative, Great hospitality from all the staff staring from the recpition untill check out very fast check in 2 extent location very good activity in the hotel and nearby i really can t explain in few words this is the best hotel I visit
393866,Sir Adam Hotel, I didn t like how you get charged an extra 50 deposit when you check in and if you do this by debit card they only refund you the 50 in cash and not straight to your card , The staff were very friendly and helpful And the complimentary drink on arrival was a nice touch Views over Amsterdam are great Record players in the rooms are cool 
393867,Sir Adam Hotel, Making most out of space taking slightly too far The room has no actual bathroom You have 2 doors one is the toilet and the other is a 2mx1 5m room which was transformed into a shower don t know how else to describe the bathroom sink is inside the bedroom Other than that no complains, Great staff and super cool environment with lots of out of the box decorations Specially the pool and ping pong table in the foyer On arrival you ll find a bar as reception and a handwritten note in your room I don t drink but I think the Heineken in the room is on the house
393868,Sir Adam Hotel,No Negative, We really enjoyed this accommodation with its great location in Amsterdam North located in the former Shell Headquarters in the A dam tower The hotel s employees are very helpful and ensured that we will have a memorial experience The industrial interior in the room topped up with warm add ons e g brown leather blinds super fluffy bedspread floor heating in the bathroom etc made us feel home away from home We stayed in a corner room that offers several windows to enjoy a great view overlooking the Ij river Don t forget you select some vinyl s in the lobby and play it on your own pick up record player you have in the room and have a closer look through the binoculars spotting ships passing by the hotel all day long The bathroom is bright with a window from top to bottom that offers a great view while showering PS Make sure to take all the elevators at least once you will be surprised Thank you Sir Adam 
393869,Sir Adam Hotel,No Negative, Hotel with best view ever with best staff manager ever with top design and great place to hangout with my best friends And in the centre of Amsterdam After a nice bite cocktails at The Butcher Bar groundfloor we showed some moves on the dancefloor in Shelter hidden danceclub in the basement But after a good night sleep in the most comfy bed all fresh fruity in the morning WE ADAM Thxs for the ride X
