182734,La Suite West Hyde Park, Put us is the darkest room in the basement We had to pass the kitchen back of house on the way Bathroom was tiny Restaurant too weird to eat at Reception staff very unfriendly Couldn t even show me where the hotel was on a map of London , Well located with lots of convenience stores and Hyde park nearby Interior decor very nice good value for London 
182735,La Suite West Hyde Park,No Negative, When we enter the room we didnt like it at first cos the window face the backstreet n people were smoking on the steps of the restaurant across they could see us thru the window so we have to close it and the lights in the room was dim to my liking prefer natural light from outside But than closing the bind shutters we feel comfortable and really like the room spacious Junior Suite We were booked for Superior double room Had good sleep and quiet at nite Would definetly stay there again 
182736,La Suite West Hyde Park, I felt the hotel was very dark inside the corridors especially the room wasn t too bright either, We loved the shower the bed was great and really enjoyed eating our breakfast out doors The staff were really lovely especially the girl in charge of breakfast she was wonderful x
182737,La Suite West Hyde Park, The staff were unhelpful and the room had not been cleaned properly Towels were used bath soaps were missing and the toilet was unflushed there were still faeces left in the toilet bowl Disgusting Compensation of free breakfast was offered Very disappointing stay , Nice decoration and style to the room 
182738,La Suite West Hyde Park, Corridors a little too dark carpet in bedroom could do with being replaced , The location was great the staff were very friendly and competent

182740,La Suite West Hyde Park, I was welcomed by a very rude receptionist who din t let me check in early even though my room was ready She asked 25 for an early check in I was just 45 mins before the check in time Many guests who came with me got the room before I did , The manager was very cooperative 
182741,La Suite West Hyde Park, Nothing would definitely stay again next time we come to London , The room was very modern loved the 4 poster bed and the bathroom Staff were very friendly and helpful 
182742,La Suite West Hyde Park, The room and the hotel in general was very dark and was very tricky to open the blind which was behind the extremely large headboard Very noisy from room above and every time the room above used the bath shower or flushed toilet it sounded like the water was cascading into our room Very noisy , Very unusual hotel styling unlike any I have stayed at before Everything you need in a hotel room and a few extras 
182743,La Suite West Hyde Park, Early check in fee was rather hefty but did allow us to come back late without worrying and check out was a pain as there was only 1 receptionist , We stayed here for an event at Hyde park and it was a great hotel and great value without being too far away 
182744,La Suite West Hyde Park, We checked in on line thinking this would speed things up How wrong was I check in took longer IT system not playing well key card reader not working receptionist rebooted system twice what farce Then we where upgraded to junior suite Like all the corridors room was dark and unwelcoming carpet was on of the most uncomfortable pieces of material I have ever walked on Carpet had been ripped and covered in masking tape Doors to cupboards and bathroom where tatty from poor maintenance The hotel has a theme of unsung black as standard colour scheme which works if hotel has abundance of natural light to counter the dank appearance this hotel does not have enough that Corridors you walked down can t see where your going Can t see room numbers easy you walk along this black corridor and you get disorientated where you are loose your way horrible feeling People may like this and other rooms might be different but room 17 was very poor as a junior suite Room was not worth the money will never stay here again , Location of the property was ok if you want Notting Hill Bayswater to walk too and then use public transport for other areas 
182745,La Suite West Hyde Park, The rooms are looking slightly tired needs a little sprucing , Plenty of space nice staff right by two tube stations Very handy at a good central London price

182747,La Suite West Hyde Park, The internet connection was very poor which is a problem if on business breakfast was not included , Excellent bathroom actually nearly same size as bedroom Bedroom was very small and dark very comfortable bed with good quality sheets Fine for one night but would request a larger room for longer stay 
182748,La Suite West Hyde Park, There was no bar not a major disaster but it wasn t clear on your website the hotel has a no alcohol policy The wardrobe adjacent the bed light would not switch off and the doors were slatted light on all night not great The plumbing shower refilling WC sound was terrible from bathroom above Hard o navigate around bed without hitting wall mounted TV,No Positive
182749,La Suite West Hyde Park,No Negative, We had a lovely suite Unfortunately didn t have time to enjoy the space as we didn t arrive to the hotel until 9 30pm and left first thing in the morning Seemed like it had a lovely restaurant very clean hotel and fantastic location Staff were very helpful 
182750,La Suite West Hyde Park, The street was quite noisy on the Friday night seemed ok on the Saturday night The bathroom could maybe have done with a redecoration starting to look a little dated , Having our own entrance was good The room was a very good size and the amenities were pretty good 
182751,La Suite West Hyde Park, The gym please don t call it that Its a room witch cardiomachines Some barbells but not enough room to use them propperly But a good start tough , The staff vas friendly and helpfull I also liked the maze to get to the room small dark cozy corridors The room was very nice to with a beutiful and clean shower Really good coffe in the room 
182752,La Suite West Hyde Park, Whilst there was a good connection to Wi Fi the hotel s local packets did not always allow for a stable connection or made it very slow My partner is an IT technician and checked the specifics Whilst our room was a superior it did not allow for the the placement of an open suitcase let alone 2 Suitcases had to be placed on bed to open and then closed in order to find space on floor This would apply if you had only one small case as well Very dark corridors with unusual array of steps Could hear footsteps and all other noises from room above Had a high bath could be a plus but could make it difficult for those less able to access the shower which is over the bath Very little protection from water from shower spilling over to bathroom floor , 5 minute walk to Bayswater station with minimal steps Plenty of restaurants supermarket options and general shops within 2 10 minute walk Fresh fruit provided daily Superior room had kitchenette sink 
182753,La Suite West Hyde Park, I didn t sleep because over my room 16 there was a constant noise all evening from sth like laundry I rang on 22 15 to complain but they did not sort it out and I did not get sleep due to noise , Nice design and spacious room 
182754,La Suite West Hyde Park, Breakfast quality was poor and the restaurant staff didn t seem to be 100 sure what they were doing First morning waited over 20mins for coffee and 40mins for our breakfast which was over cooked and had items missing We didn t complain as we had waited long enough and already witnessed the staff making a few other mistakes with other customers If I chose to stay here again I DEFINITELY wouldn t pay for breakfast here , Bathroom was really nice 
182755,La Suite West Hyde Park, N A , A modern newly refurbished hotel with excellent Stone throw away from tube stations 2 tube stations which will give access to all of London Good neighborhood with plenty of restaurants supermarkets and even a small shopping centre Free mobile phone for use throughout London so one won t need to have local phone line roaming charges

182757,La Suite West Hyde Park, the regular breakfast was expensive compared to what was on display need to add more cheese options they ran out of strawberry jam and they only have 3 options honey marmalade strawberry the croissant are only warm if you go early for breakfast later they are cold and not fresh, the staff is nice and quick to solve all problems the bed is comfortable the room size was perfect
182758,La Suite West Hyde Park, It was a bit tricky to know where to go for dinner as the restaurant is rather niche , Really wonderful shower room and great to have real coffee in the room 
182759,La Suite West Hyde Park, Only one issue There are steps leading to many rooms in addition to the elevator Guests leaving in the morning can be heard moving luggage down the stairs , Clean stylish hotel 
182760,La Suite West Hyde Park, Would have liked more light in room as quite dark by mirrors to put make up on and read No phone signal Rubbish entrance door too small too heavy to open with cases and quite scruffy Did not match excellence of hotel , Lovely vigorous shower And comfy bed
182761,La Suite West Hyde Park, almost nothing, most of the staff were excellent especially francesco was the best he found our jewellery we left at the room and always helpfull fabio also great love with the bathroom with shower jet for toilet location was excellent few step to food and station 
182762,La Suite West Hyde Park, Rooms are dark I stayed in two different rooms One had no window fine to sleep but not pleasant in the day The second was much bigger with a large window Even overlooking the buildings at the back it was such a relief Rooms lights are poor I trust there are rooms facing the main street with more natural light , Location Location Location Public transport bars restaurants parks shops Plus a lovely terrace in season on a street which does not get much traffic 
182763,La Suite West Hyde Park, There was a humming noise that could be heard as if it was a fridge running etc but it did not stop me from sleeping , Hotel was clean and the room comfortable The bed was large and very comfortable with a great shower 
182764,La Suite West Hyde Park, Nothing, Lovely room massive bed marble floor in bathroom with under floor heating lush Pleasant helpful staff and fruit and water available in room and reception although it was lovely it was wasted on me alone as it would be idea for a romantic get away with soft mood lighting in the rooms 
182765,La Suite West Hyde Park, The bathroom was tiny and had a smell of mold It took ages to get hot water in the shower Bad ventilation The staff did not provide the service that was expected Some of them were a bit rude The hotel seems a lot nicer on the pictures than in reality ,No Positive
182766,La Suite West Hyde Park, Room was small very dark with poor lighting Air con didn t work very well and room was too hot, Very good location 2 minute walk to the tube and local supermarkets
182767,La Suite West Hyde Park, My room was a good size but very dark and with no opportunity to open a window as the bedhead was against the window I even had difficulty pulling down the blind and there it stayed for the entirety of my stay My major problem was that the desk staff member took a pre authorisation on my card for all 3 rooms booked even though the accounts were being paid for by each individual room guest and then refused to reverse the amount for the duration of my stay which severely limited my spending while in London no apologies were offered and at check out they debited the cost of my room and the pre authorisation amount took another 3 days to be reversed this ruined a potentially happy times for me , The location was good
182768,La Suite West Hyde Park, Had to change initial room due to noise level of some type of generator running on floor below it room 104 , Good location near tube station Staff was very nice and helpful Breakfast had gluten free option 
182769,La Suite West Hyde Park, An adapter for the iPod phone to fit the music player But a small quibble this hotel is just great , I LOVED this hotel Easily the best I ve stayed in London for a similar price and I ve stayed in lots The DAB radio ipod phone player was much appreciated Although you ll need to bring an adapter I also loved the touch activated lamp lights The TV had a HMD input so I could also play You Tube BBC iplayer etc from my phone I also brought my own adapter Wi Fi signal was good enough for this Everything WORKED which in my long experience is not at all something to be taken for granted in London hotels Just beside Bayswater Tube and a short walk to Queensway Tube 
182770,La Suite West Hyde Park, I was charged twice on a preauthorisation for the total cost of my stay and that was not reversed during my 5 day stay the staff blamed the credit card company but nothing to release almost A 1000 that I was unable to spend during my holiday due to their mistake Gross incompetence and no customer service skills displayed at all 6 days later and 2 days after leaving the amount is still on my card No mention of full prepayment at the time of check in and it was suggested that this was a precaution against me not settling my account Treated like a criminal with no parole period Never ever again will I either stay here not will I ever recommend the hotel to anyone despite its great location , Not much dark rooms with no ability to open windows for fresh air The concierge lost my sisters luggage for several hours after placing it in the wrong room and not being able to remember where he put it 
182771,La Suite West Hyde Park, hotel doesn t have their own proper umbrella for customer, breakfast is good and excellent location only 3 stops to oxford street on central line and 1 min to metro station 
182772,La Suite West Hyde Park, the female front desk chose people to attend to not worrying about th done who was there first it happened because they speak the same language not English , Location cleanliness
182773,La Suite West Hyde Park, The staff appeared to be less friendly than the reviews, It was winter and the toilet s floor was heated And i really like that they have hose in the toilet
182774,La Suite West Hyde Park, Area was a bit shabby but got it s charm The hotel is focused on health so if you like your pints and full meals this is not the place to be If you get excited about raw food and smoothies this is totally up your alley , Location is fantastic In the middle of two subway stations and walking distance from Hyde Park 
182775,La Suite West Hyde Park, Expensive breakfast, The breakfast was not particularly good Ham cheese white bred and porridge Good coffee though Nice decor but quite weared down already The hotel is non alcohol That is for us not a problem but ok to know before a late arrival and wanting a glass of red wine 
182776,La Suite West Hyde Park, Didn t dislike anything Didn t use any of the food facilities so can t comment on those , Fabulous room and very clean The bathroom was amazing Happy with the hotel and location All in all a lovely place to stay and tube places to eat right on your doorstep 
182777,La Suite West Hyde Park, 50 deposit in lieu of spend during stay which for some reason couldn t be refunded immediately at checking out Bedroom too warm even with aircon left on at 17degrees and fan at full room 103 , Great location friendly and helpful staff 
182778,La Suite West Hyde Park, The restaurant closed before we even got there it wasnt all vegan Or even vegetarian so the breakfast was a huge let down The staff seemed pretty miserable All of that for over 200 pounds is madness , The bed was great nice interior design lovely outside area
182779,La Suite West Hyde Park, Restaurant is not my cup of tea I am not vegan It would have been nice to have more dining options But it was fine since there were a few restaurants in the neighborhood I would have liked to have the breakfast included Check in time is too late at 2 pm , Very convenient location Close to transportation Nice staff
182780,La Suite West Hyde Park, Rooms in need of refurbishment restaurant closed for a private event 24 hr room service offered in room but the kitchen was closed , Stylish and interesting
182781,La Suite West Hyde Park, Carpet was too rough the shower had no curtain so keeping the water from spraying out and getting the whole bathroom wet was a task the tub was sitting too high to get in even for me and I am 6 1 and a lot of rooms are without proper windows and are too dark even during the day, Pasta during In room dinner was very tasty Outdoor patio is wonderful but it s a shame you are not allowed to have a drink there 
182782,La Suite West Hyde Park, when I returned from the evening out the room was boiling hot I called reception and nothing was done Finally at 1 30am I got up to go to reception as I could not sleep and they realised they had the room set to HOT and 25c with no apology or concern for our sleep It took about another hour for the room to cool but honestly I ve stayed in holiday inns for half the price and are far better , Not much 
182783,La Suite West Hyde Park, My room was too small you couldn t have more than one person in the room at the same time , Very convenient hotel and because London was extremely hot in September the air conditioning worked very well

182785,La Suite West Hyde Park, Front desk wasn t exactly the warmest unless when approached then they were friendly Rooms are not noise cancelling , The rooms are huge for London standard Bathroom too We loved our room And the location is excellent literally a one minute walk to Bayswater underground station 
182786,La Suite West Hyde Park, The staff where very unhelpful from the start of our trip the hotel just seemed to have gotten worse The room was already paid in full on arrival we had to pay for the room again They said they would refund the booking com payment back in 5 7 working days my work colleague was also staying in the same hotel and stayed in a double room whilst mine was a deluxe double room Their room was much large than mine I found this strange as I had paid almost 50 extra The hotel also turned the water off for most of a day We had an awards ceremony to attend at 6 30 and the water just came on at 5 30 , The room was nice 
182787,La Suite West Hyde Park, the subway is right under the hotel the trains ran until 1 in the morning were loud hard to sleep while listening to the noise all the time they collected 50 pounds charged my credit card before i could actually be taken to my room just in case i charged anything or tore something up of course i didn t but they assured me it would not show up on my card statement which it has they had better reverse that pretty quickly i was not told in advance that this would be done i fully paid for the room way in advance , i liked the size of the room the ammenities like frig good shampoo conditioner pretty dark tho
182788,La Suite West Hyde Park, You can here the underground trains till very late and early After a night here you need a good nights sleep , The Hotel is close to a thriving shopping area and easily accessable rom both Bayswater and Queensway subway
182789,La Suite West Hyde Park, The room size you can not walk on it 3mX3m The room quality Walls need to be painted Wooden doors and drawers scratched Carpet is too dirty Refrigerator minibar is noisy and there is noting on it Bed sheet no changes if we didn t ask for Toilet soap and shampo empty notes they don t remove it after cleaning the room the hotel should not be rated more than 3 star , It is next to two major metro lines
182790,La Suite West Hyde Park, Got down for breakfast at 10am Not overly busy Did not get our cooked breakfast until gone 11 Tea pot also had a glass jar top inside it which was a bit off putting Also room was very noisy from outside Can t believe an expensive hotel like this would not have double or triple glazing ,No Positive
182791,La Suite West Hyde Park, The front desk is very unfrofessional The girls from front desk has no courtesy and very rude to tell off another employee in front of client Their maths is horrible When I check out they cannot figure out the final payment within their own staff with lots of confusion , The location is excellent with two subway stations within 5 minutes walk Many restaurants nearby and shops 
182792,La Suite West Hyde Park, No alcohol so no bar wine cocktails , Very nice ambiance quite dark but liked it the staff were excellent I got an upgrade to junior suite it was a lovely weekend in a perfect location in London 
182793,La Suite West Hyde Park, Size of the room is a bit small, Location of the hotel surrounded by great restaurants Not too far from major tourist attractions and shopping belts

182795,La Suite West Hyde Park, i didn t take the card that I had originally paid with I had to pay again and then wait for a refund I wouldn t stay here again our room was very small and noisy banging pipes and water running, It was in an excellent position it was very clean but the room was very small for what was labelled a superior room 
182796,La Suite West Hyde Park, No waiting staff in the restaurant bar when we returned for a nightcap at 10pm Also wanted 50 deposit pre authorised on my card when checking in , Location close to Paddington and underground stations and lots of pubs and places to dine Comfortable and very quiet room in the city 
182797,La Suite West Hyde Park, I thought for what we paid did not reflect what we got The service in the restaurant is poor with poor english understanding from the staff I asked for a newspaper and received a menu It was obvious there was a low patronage in the restaurant Service cost and time receiving meals needs to be looked at if you want to be a high end hotel The blind cord in our room was broken which I advised the front desk and was later told that they sent someone to look at the fridge and that it was ok I then advised that my husband had fixed the blind as it was 3 days later There was nothing wrong with the fridge , The location 
182798,La Suite West Hyde Park, The room was not as shown on the hotel images Very worn down furniture and not too a high standard Changed rooms twice before we finally settled on a room with working air con Didn t like the hotel ,No Positive

182806,La Suite West Hyde Park,No Negative, We stayed in the junior suite The room was so cosy I could have stayed in bed all day The bath was also amazing I jumped in it every night after long days of walking Room service was fast as hell Everything was top 
182807,La Suite West Hyde Park, The room I stayed had a leaking bathroom making the bedroom carpet wet and hence felt a bit messy and dirty One day was raining and there was no umbrella in the hotel available for borrowing , Conveniently located next to tube station
182808,La Suite West Hyde Park,No Negative, This hotel is brilliant The value for money it offers with regards to location rooms cleanliness and comfort is unbelievable I would recommend booking the Junior Suite as the other other rooms are a little small but they are so well planned comfortable that it doesn t feel cramped at all The staff is very helpful and accommodating and we will definitely stay here the next time we re in London 
182809,La Suite West Hyde Park, The room was a bit dark and it was a shame there was no bar it would have been niece to sit and have a quite drink in the evening, Comfortable room and friendly helpful staff
182810,La Suite West Hyde Park, Not sure happen the breakfast if any for us we are used to self service so we found what was on offer a little strange Not complaining all was well, Bed comfy the pillows were great and the accessibility to where we wanted to be was great
182811,La Suite West Hyde Park, The bed post I knocked my head against it because it s too narrow to get onto bed , Location is very near Bayswater underground and many food outlets nearby 
182812,La Suite West Hyde Park, We need to leave our huge suitcase when we trip to Spain but the manager of this hotel refused it because we were not coming back to their hotel eve though we stayed for long time and checking out and coming back again during two weeks and introduced many friend to stay their hotel I would suggest to them that the customer service should not be followed manual all the time but they must be flexible to being as customer Centric otherwise they never create a competitive customer experience in the future , receptionist was very friendly and I felt very comfortable when checked in 
182813,La Suite West Hyde Park, The lighting was pretty low should have options for people who want brighter rooms The blinds style while chic were not very effective The fitting allowed light in so when the sun rises unfortunately I would wake up too Some days the sun was rising at 4 and going down as late as 10pm , The service tops it all Everyone was exceptional the whole time I was there 9 days 
182814,La Suite West Hyde Park, Small rooms noisy neighborhood and windows are not sound proof enough on street side Queensway Bayswater side is going downhill too busy and low end, The overall design sweet staff green apples RAW restaurant terrace area
182815,La Suite West Hyde Park, The flooring in the room was a little uncomfortable after a hard days walking through London but the room was great overall , The hotel really went out of their way to make us feel welcome We were immediately welcomed into the hotel and shown where there was suitable parking after enquiring we were also given a local parking discount ticket We loved the room the ambience of the hotel was excellent really modern and minimalist and the location was great Would definitely recommend based on our experience 
182816,La Suite West Hyde Park, Narrow room Some of staffs were very bad and didn t understand customer service When we asked to keep our small baggages until we come back to London due to our short trip to outside London they rejected our request As we 9 guests from Japan statyed more than 4 nights and spent so much money at this hotel they did not keep our baggages because of no pammision from their manager We asked them many times but they didn t confirm their manager and told us that their priority was their manager and not customers They didn t care costumer experience and expected us to use again It was ver bad and disappointing experience for us We will never stay this hotel and will not recommend to use , Some of staffers were nice 
182817,La Suite West Hyde Park, The room was very dirty there were stains on the table the carpet there was thick layers of dust behind the headboard There was blood stains on the duvet The bedsheet came off the duvet and was too big this is when we saw the blood and yellow urine looking stains on the duvet disgusting , I liked the location and the interior of the hotel 
182818,La Suite West Hyde Park,No Negative, The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was quiet which was nice after arriving from Sydney The room was small however it had all facilities to make the stay comfortable and enjoyable We could have stayed a week and it wouldn t have bothered us Staff were all very friendly and helpful and the location was great 
182819,La Suite West Hyde Park, Rooms are not consistent I was first in 101 which was fantastic 4 poster bed a large wardrobe and a huge bathroom with a bath tub and heatted flooring And then i was moved to 308 which was tiny and below my expectations the bathroom was literally a hole in the wall , The staff were very friendly and helpful Location is fantastic right outside Bayswater tube station and walking distance from Queensway and Notting Hill Access to loads of restaurants and supermarkets 
182820,La Suite West Hyde Park, The one thing I wanna complain about when I get in my room the mobile signal is so bad In all night the signal always no service It also can use hotel wifi but it is unstable , The staffs are so nice The facility is very clean and comfortable 
182821,La Suite West Hyde Park, The room is very small but I was informed that there are bigger rooms available also if you need to be a vegan to really enjoy this place , The staff is super friendly and welcoming from the time of check in till check out The area is also super quiet and very close to the underground Bayswater and Queensway stations just 2 mins walk The bathroom is 5 stars I will miss my stay at this hotel and I will surely book again maybe a bigger room next time 
182822,La Suite West Hyde Park, A tat dark Plus my room quite small was off in the back Yes it was quiet in terms of street or city noise but something was clanging or dripping heater air con water system and thus i was awoken often during both nights I did mention it to the staff as I was leaving , Loved the location Have been at this hotel many times before Nice building too 
182823,La Suite West Hyde Park, I can t complain as it was a free upgrade however if I had paid for a junior suite I would have been shocked at how small it was The kitchen consisted of a sink So I could wash up but not even a microwave so no cooking facilities I never needed it so was ok , We went for our 10th anniversary and we got upgraded to a junior suite Free of charge Staff where extremely friendly and accommodating also went out and came back to find a cake with happy anniversary Lovely touch
182824,La Suite West Hyde Park, can t think of any , Location very close to bayswater station Convenient for travelers with heavy luggages Service During check in greeted with friendly receptionist and offered complimentary juice on arrival State of the art facilities in the room all working clean and comfy bed Accommodating On check out we were allowed to keep our luggage in the hotel while we waited for our bus later in the evening 
182825,La Suite West Hyde Park, The only thing we didn t like was the fact that the only restaurant at the hotel was vegan raw food and that wasn t our thing, Loved the modern room We also got a free upgrade which was such a lovely thing for Valentine s Day Loved how the whole hotel was so modern and chic The foyer was beautiful Candles which were nice Love big bed with TV electronically coming out of the suite at the end of the bed
182826,La Suite West Hyde Park, Breakfast food in the hotel was quite costly , The location was excellent Two tube stations just a few minutes away entrance to Kensington gardens was also a few minutes walk Plenty of places locally to grab a bite to eat have a sit down meal The room was comfortable facilities were good too 
182827,La Suite West Hyde Park, Wish we were staying longer Just missed having a bar lounge but we knew that when we booked , Free upgrade Charming touches for Valentine s Day and my companion s birthday Staff totally delightful polite and friendly Nothing too much trouble 
182828,La Suite West Hyde Park,No Negative, The Staff was very friendly and helpful Also very positive to mention is that they provided us the requested seperated beds as well as an earlier check in at 10 am without charging us any tremendous fees Good location next to Hyde Park and close to Paddington Station Heathrow Express 10 min walk Not even 5 mins walk to Bayswater and Queensway Underground 
182829,La Suite West Hyde Park, Ripped carpet and awful to walk on in room Lighter found under bed and not the best paint job Bathroom was a bit grimey too , Beds were very comfortable and helpful staff Decor was also lovely 
182830,La Suite West Hyde Park, For paying so much money you d expect at least a razor in the Bathroom or a tooth brush Staff couldn t speak English You could here the tube every 10 minuets night life is loud No really that happy I expected so much more for the Money I paid perhaps that s just London though, The bathroom was gorgeous the marble is a lovely touch
