303013,Best Western Hotel City, You need to walk up a few steps stairway to get to the lift The lift is narrow But it s better than without one , Modern hotel in a great location comfort beds and pillows fantastic breakfasts great welcome drinks free luggage storage after checkout The staff replied to emails very quickly 
303014,Best Western Hotel City, At 4 am there was some clicking sound which lasted for about 30 minutes I didn t know what was it It was frustrating and I couldn t sleep I hope the hotel management can take note of it but otherwise the hotel is very good ,No Positive
303015,Best Western Hotel City, Overall a good hotel to recommend, It was a comfortable hotel not too far from the train station about 9 minutes drive The breakfast each day was tasty The hotel is located near a metro station Lima on the red line for the subway Unes grocery store and Lavaderia 3 Elle laundromat walking distance about four five blocks south of the hotel Great Italian barber shop L italiano about 7 minutes walk from hotel and very reasonable prices Hotel worth the recommendation Thanks to Massimo Alberto and Eliana for making our first trip to Milan memorable and comfortable 
303016,Best Western Hotel City, Air conditioning wasn t working in the room when we arrived It took a little bit for the staff to understand it was really a problem but once they did they quickly moved us into a new room with great air conditioning , Basic but recently renovated hotel room Not too far from the Train station and the Metro was just outside the door 
303017,Best Western Hotel City, Bathroom really small shower cabin very narrow The hotel gives the impression of needing a renovation No business feeling Poor breakfast , Good location at Corso Buenos Aires and 5min walk to main train station 
303018,Best Western Hotel City, Lift is too small and not very practical as you have to carry your baggage for about 7 steps with no help from the hotel , Hotel was ok for our short stay Much time was spent out side 
303019,Best Western Hotel City, Nil issues , Very friendly staff Room was very quiet given busy location and breakfast was very good for 3 euros a day Wi fi worked very well always All in all an excellent property 
303020,Best Western Hotel City, The street next to hotel is rather noisy at the nighttime if you have windows on the street , A balcony was nice surprise The room was big enough for three person The staff at the reception was great A location is great next to Lima station at M1 Breakfast was super 
303021,Best Western Hotel City, The breakfast was not worth it the space for breakfast is limited and not enough for the guests The cuisine personel is slow although they are very kind and probably their number is less than the number needed for the breakfast to be duly operated , Bed was awsome the hotel was situated at a great location Right across the street there is theatre Welcoming drinks was a great idea 
303022,Best Western Hotel City,No Negative, Loved the balcony decor very good breakfast two rooms for the three of us with a bathroom in the centre It also had a full bath tub with a shower in it 
303023,Best Western Hotel City, The washbasin in my room was a little blocked, The hotel is located at walking distance from the Milan central train station Also it is on Corso Buenos Aires which is a major shopping street in Milan The beds were super comfortable with all the amenities in the room The room was fully equipped A mini bar with all kinds of drinks tea coffee making facilities toiletries 
303024,Best Western Hotel City, The only thing that I would complain about if I have to would be the lack of socket around my bed and as a result I can t use my phone in bed while having it charged , Not far away from the central train station where I was dropped off from the airport shuttle bus and started to walk for around 10 mins and the metro station is just around the corner It s on a quite busy but not very tourist main street with great local restaurants and gelato places around Breakfast is better than average among Italian hotels and it s just 3 euros so why not 
303025,Best Western Hotel City, Although noise from the street is filtered out by the windows the walls between rooms are very thin and you can hear everything from rooms around , Staff in the hotel is nice location is in walking distance to the centre Facilities are modern and clean rooms are quite big 
303026,Best Western Hotel City, There was no aircon in the room Hence we had to open the window However the location is along the main road possibility that it would be a bit noisy at times Also there are times that it is hot or warm in the evening but it is definitely warm at daytime So we requested for a cooler or a fan at least for the room where my nephew is The staff happily provided it , Excellent location Clean and well maintained rooms The reception or lobby is comfortable Free coffee in the recepton area 24 7 just brilliant Breakfast area is clean Healthy variety of food choices The staff are friendly and very accomodating on our requests We appreciate it very much Thanks 
303027,Best Western Hotel City, Our room was definitely not worth the price Each day between 8 10 am we couldn t open the balcony door to let fresh air in because the smell of food was overwhelming and our room was on the 4th floor The only hotel elevator was extremely small max 3 persons could fit in it The bathroom shower head needed to be changed as it had no pressure at all , Breakfast was very good with a lot of options also fresh fruit Location is very convenient at a walking distance from the city center and right next to the subway Our room was spacious and tidy 
303028,Best Western Hotel City,No Negative, Excellent staff in the reception very helpful and knew all the time what to do in different situations Breakfast s value for money was very good pleasant personnel also there

303031,Best Western Hotel City, In first morning we went to have breakfast later and then were not so many things left And they didn t bring more might be we just needed to ask but we didn t Next mornings we went earlier and everything was just fine , Bed was comfortable Triple room quite large It was pleasant to wake up of smell of fresh croissants 
303032,Best Western Hotel City, I should have stay more , Everything was perfect starting with the staff of the hotel Massimo from the reception was very professional and gave me all the Information I needed and most of all he was always smiling I have felt like home The hotel is very clean the breakfast is prepaired for all the tastes and each morning the smell of fresh baked croissants invaded my room Good location for shopping Central Station can be reached in a short walk and Duomo is at three metro stations Fabulous for Milano 
303033,Best Western Hotel City,No Negative, The stuff was very nice The hotel is located on a shopping street Nice pizza restaurants and ice cream shops cN be found nearby Hotel room was clean big enough had a balcony Parking is not available in hotel but 3 streets above there is a street with full of parking places Pay hour free after 19 00 blue lines They give discount card 30 which is valid in GAP store Enjoyed alot here 
303034,Best Western Hotel City, We got firstly a room where the heating was not working however finally end of the day we got a new room In the breakfast the fruit salad had strange taste I could not eat it All in all we were happy anyway Thank you for everything , I went with my Mum for a few days and we were very satisfied actually Friendly staff nice room perfect location

303039,Best Western Hotel City,No Negative, Staff were fantastic Eliana on reception helped me out before I even arrived travelling myself with my children and then gave me plenty of tips once there all staff were very friendly 
303040,Best Western Hotel City, Having to leave , The front desk staff are very helpful with good English language Ms Elainna a guardian angel is exceptional in directing us to all of Milano tourist attractions all taking car of car parking etc The breakfast is very rich quality and quantity at all times 
303041,Best Western Hotel City, Rooms are really noisy very small bathroom is old fashioned dirty traces of humidity on the roof walls impossible to get warm water i had to wait for 10 mn Air conditioned does not work Breakfast is very cheap cheap products and not good at all This hotel is very expensive for what it is , Location is good
303042,Best Western Hotel City, The hotel wasn t cheap at all and the breakfast can be improved but it s so centraly placed that for us it was worth the money , The location of the hotel is amazing The street is full of shops and cafes Metro super market within few minutes of walk 25 min of walk from Duomo and 20 min of walk from the central train station The room was great and sound proof the staff were lovely and always willing to help I recommend 
303043,Best Western Hotel City, The small size of the lift , All Reception staff are very cordial friendly and helpful Many thanks go to Ms Eliana at front desk for being very helpful at check in and making all arrangments for a very smooth landing in room requested via booking com Also she guided us to all Milan touristic places The breakfast variety quality and quantity are of excellent standard 
303044,Best Western Hotel City, I think that have a smile for staff could help this property to increase its score and make it almost perfect, Almost Every thing was great especially location and facilities
303045,Best Western Hotel City, But there is a bad smell one side of the bed , Good location Metro station is outside the door Many good shops and restaurant on the street outside the hotel Staff is very nice My room looks really good and facilities are easy to use 
303046,Best Western Hotel City, I had a room facing Corso Buenos Aires and it was pretty noisy If you are a light sleeper bring earplugs with you The hairdryer is somewhat old , Breakfast is great large variety of food hot dishes Location is really convenient close to Milano Centrale literally two steps from the metro and right on the Corso Buenos Aires The room is neat and tidy but nothing special decor wise I only stayed for one night but would come here again 
303047,Best Western Hotel City, non arrival the elevator to the ground reception and lack of the service to receipt the bags to the room, i liked location of the hotel and the good of hospitality
303048,Best Western Hotel City, Slightly bigger rooms would be wonderful, Friendly staff very professional fastest check in ever for me while travelling in Europe room key and details were ready on arrival and nice clean room 
303049,Best Western Hotel City, please make the bacon crispier , yes breakfast was great the view from the breakfast room is good although the food variety was limited but of excellent quality 
303050,Best Western Hotel City, Room quite noisey beside busy road , Hotel very convenient to metro and close to Central Station and only a few stops to the Duomo Room small but comfortable A C worked well Staff friendly and very helpful Allowed us to have a late check out for no extra charge Lots of choice for breakfast Chocolate croissants delicious 
303051,Best Western Hotel City, The neighborhood was full of life and shops however it was a bit noisy , Very kind and friendly staff Nice location with metro station just outside the hotel The room was very comfortable with balcony The bathroom was a bit narrow but it didn t cause any problem Extra credits for the beauty kit with Garnier products 
303052,Best Western Hotel City, The only thing I can think of as negative is that the hot water in the shower suddenly disappear and the water turns ice cold That can be a bit shocking, Perfect location within walking distance to the train station where you will find the buses and train to Milan s airports With metro station just outside the hotel door you can easily reach the rest of Milan and all the sights Very close to shopping and restaurants The rooms are relatively large and of good standard some even with private balcony The breakfast plentiful with everything one could ask for In short a hotel to recommend for your stay in Milan
303053,Best Western Hotel City, towels smell badly woman receptionist does not know anything about Milano I think, room is clean breakfast is enough location is good beside lima metro station red line M1 the guys at the reception were really helpfull
303054,Best Western Hotel City, Hotel bar closes early, Rooms were clean and tidy You could hear road noise but that s to be expected when you book a hotel on a main road It certainly didn t keep us awake Breakfast was very good value for money Plenty on offer Walk to Cathedral and shops about 20mins 
303055,Best Western Hotel City, Keep up the good work employ more staff like Alberto , Our visit to Best Western Hotel City was made as enjoyable as it was due mainly to the service we received from Alberto on the reception desk We had a problem with one of the tours we had planned he went out of his was to help us sort it out He was fantastic always smiling willing to help We wished we could have stayed longer 
303056,Best Western Hotel City, They use a blanket as the sleep cover which is really really uncomfortable Our room is face to the street it could be loud at night , The location is really good 2 min walk to a metro station and close to a small shopping street It only takes 3 stops to San Babila luxury shops area and 4 stops to Doumo 10 min walk to the central train station

303065,Best Western Hotel City, The bathroom of the single room was very small I actually banged into the wall while taking a step back to look at myself in the mirror Felt a little overpriced It doesn t feel like a real hotel since it is so small but then it is Europe Would ve loved fluffy duvets instead of blankets, The staff was very helpful Specially all the guys at the front desk The location was excellent as it is literally 20 steps away from the Lima metro station which gets you to Duomo in less than 5 minutes and is on the direct line to Rho Fiera Breakfast is good Coffee is incredible Strong wifi
