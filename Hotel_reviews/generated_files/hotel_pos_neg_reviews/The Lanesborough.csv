346688,The Lanesborough, The clever electronic controls failed TWICE despite an engineer fixing them The layout had been designed by that Chinese cartographer Confusion No brush in the loo or even hidden in a cupboard Excessive use of gold decorations, Very nice food everywhere Hidden television very clever 
346689,The Lanesborough, Lack of attentativness of staff For example at breakfast I requested right away simply tea and toast and rather then order it I was seated served water and then a waiter came to give me a menue and ask what I we want three different staff and 15 minutes later instead of the ma tre d just ordering it All despite stating I had very limited time having to catch a flight , Location 
346690,The Lanesborough, Currently the Gym and Spa areas are disappointing and not in keeping with the rest However I am advised that a brand new facility will be available to guest from March 2017, Bed and bed linen supremely comfortable Service is always efficient discreet and courteous Very good formal restaurant and even room service is beautifully presented with care and attention to the small details 
346691,The Lanesborough, Dining room seemed a little disorganized We only tried it for breakfast and found the service a little slow with one incorrect order Not what I would have expected here , The new decor is exquisite a marvellous mix of tradition with all the modern amenities The front desk staff and concierge are top notch in their knowledge of the city and very pleasant and helpful The Lanesborough s location is very convenient we walked everywhere

346696,The Lanesborough, nothing , Well where do I start the lanes borough most certainly lives up to its ratings My partner and I absolutely loved our time here It was our anniversary and I m glad we spent it here The staff and service for sure is 10 10 They even went as far as to give us a surprise complementary desert wishing us a happy anniversary and free Champaign and strawberries placed in our room whilst we were at dinner in the wonderful Celeste restaurant I 100 suggests this hotel Quality food drinks rooms and staff
