144420,The Queens Gate Hotel, The bathtub cleanliness wasn t inviting enough to enjoy this amenity The high speed WIFI was very spotty , The room included a smartphone to use international and domestic calls as well as unlimited data This was free of charge and helped me navigate the city and stay connected The staff was pleasant and accommodating The room view was fantastic and the room itself was spacious with two large windows 
144421,The Queens Gate Hotel, Food choice in restaurant was very limited and restaurant was quite small for a fairly large hotel Found drink sizes a bit small for price charged , General Facilities were great but the room was not quite so good had very squeaky floor boards alonside the bed particularly as had asked for a good room as celebrating our 60 th wedding anniversary 
144422,The Queens Gate Hotel, Nothing , The hotel was in a fantastic location and only a 5 minute walk to the nearest London Underground station The hotel itself was refreshing and a polished appearance which represented its 4 status The staff were extremely welcoming and happy which made the check in process that little bit easier During the stay they were also very attentive if needed and made for a comfortable stay The icing on the cake was the great price that was paid given the location 2mins from the Natural History Museum and South Kensington or 2 mins from Hyde Park 
144423,The Queens Gate Hotel, Very tired hotel room wasnt clean torn wallpaper in room and in corridor loose floor tiles in bathroom dirty mini fridge shower head fault I asked to move room but non available receptionist tried her best i did email the hotel to flag up issues but no reply , Location to the Royal Albert Hall bed v comfy 
144424,The Queens Gate Hotel, Barely enough space to walk between the bed and the desk and the shower was tiny , The hotel was clean and the staff were friendly Wifi was good too The water pressure in the shower was good too

144427,The Queens Gate Hotel,No Negative, Large room and nice facilities Nice area close to the metro Architectural design of the building gave it character Staff were friendly and very helpful 
144428,The Queens Gate Hotel, Rooms are well appointed and comfortable but it wasn t the cleanest Rooms were tidied up but not necessarily cleaned , Location is perfect Close to Gloucester and South Kensington tube stops Easy walk to the V A Science Museum Royal Albert Hall Hyde Park etc Boutique style hotel so very cozy Triples are spacious and well appointed Several wonderful restaurants nearby too 
144429,The Queens Gate Hotel, The room felt a little cramped and some breakfast items ran out and weren t replaced while we were there , The room was very nicely decorated and comfortable The staff very friendly and attentive 
144430,The Queens Gate Hotel, The water from the tap was yellow and smelt horrible The sink did not drain very well The room was extremely small for the price we paid in comparison to other 4 or 5 star hotels The overall first impression was not good The beds did not look crisp cushions seemed to have collapsed against the pillows It just didn t look perfect like other hotels we have stayed in of the same rating No free bottle of water provided in the room we have had this in numerous hotels previously Could buy from reception for 1 or the bar or mini bar for 2 50 , The shower was very good The bed was comfortable The body lotion was good and smelt lovely 
144431,The Queens Gate Hotel, Booked a twin room for two nights first night not available given a temp double room that was tiny Moved to a twin room and this room was fantastic plenty of room and very comfortable so I forgave them , Location was great style cleanliness good bar food Breakfast had a great selection Two lifts which is unusual in a relatively small hotel and staff very helpful with suitcases etc 
144432,The Queens Gate Hotel, Disappointed when we saw our room as it was a family room two normal singles and two child singles We specifically chose the hotel to have three equal single beds for three adults as we booked a triple room which looked nicer in the pictures But we didn t get into our room until past 1am so just put up with it We were also lower ground so had no view we couldn t even see the weather to know what to wear the next day That said I was told the smaller bed was comfortable enough Disappointed we couldn t have an earlier check in time as requested which meant we had to go out without seeing our room until the early hours the next day after the concert , Comfortable beds Friendly courteous staff Breakfast was good plenty of choice Rooms were a nice temperature and bedding was good quality and cosy They looked after our luggage happily
144433,The Queens Gate Hotel, N A, Superbly comfortable and quiet room and delicious breakfast with nice touches like fresh orange juice The hotel enjoys a brilliant location near Kensington Gardens Hyde Park and museums like the V A Science Museum and the Natural History Museum The friendly staff were keen to help and showed good attention to detail Would definitely stay there again

144435,The Queens Gate Hotel,No Negative, could not find a better hotel convenient for both the Albert hall on a Sunday night and the London Museumns on a Monday morning turn left for the Albert Hall and righ for the Natural history 5 minute walk if you run in both directions ideal would not choose anywhere else 
144436,The Queens Gate Hotel, Hair in bed and in the bathroom Late breakfast start only at 7 00 no vegetable Thin walls between rooms Noisy AC , Perfect supply of stuff in the room bathrobe slippers tea coffee items in the bathroom complimentary water and chocolate Magazines and newspapers in the lobby Walking distance to Albert s Hall Hyde park and tube Next to Imperial college 
144437,The Queens Gate Hotel, The telly going of at 6oclock as someone had set the alarm before our stay There was a slight smell in the room that wasn t nice , The Staff were lovely 
144438,The Queens Gate Hotel, Nothing the hotel was too over priced for the small room you go 560 for two days , Nothing the hotel was too over priced for the small room you go 560 for two days 
144439,The Queens Gate Hotel, , The staff were extremely helpful and welcoming The room was excellent standard double with great facilities in top condition including a comfortable bed The stay was brilliant and felt safe the entire time The location too is fantastic right near several national museums and the Royal Albert Hall I would readily book to stay again 
144440,The Queens Gate Hotel, The rooftop bar was closed for maintenance Shame as it was one of the reasons we chose this Hotel Also the shower seemed a touch small although this could be because we are both over 6ft , Due to availability we were upgraded to a Family room Just a little larger than normal but the extra space was a bonus The staff were very accommodating warm and polite An excellent room quiet and comfortable 
144441,The Queens Gate Hotel,No Negative, Upgraded as fully booked Extremely spacious room Very quiet even though the room was downstairs and at front of property The bed was very comfortable Toiletries were lovely 
144442,The Queens Gate Hotel, When we arrived we were told we would not be able to check in until 2 00 So we left and returned right before 2 00 only to be told it would be a few more minutes The few more minutes turned into 1 5 hours that we could have been sightseeing We also had 5 00 dinner reservations to get ready for Not a happy camper here , Not much 
144443,The Queens Gate Hotel, the price for the breakfast was to expensive for the quality of the food fried eggs over cooked hash browns very greasy mushrooms dried out overall disappointing , location for the Royal Albert Hall was fantastic 
144444,The Queens Gate Hotel, Room could ve been better for the money I note that we got swapped to room 1011 as the couple who checked in just before us complained about the room Was a room with no view which is a shame Bathroom could ve been cleaner and sink plug was also broken Could also do with decor touch up as wallpaper peeling slightly , Staff were great accomodated every need Extremely helpful and well mannered Location was great right near to Royal Albert Hall so really convenient Beds were very comfy 
144445,The Queens Gate Hotel, Rooms may be small We asked for a larger one Staff was friendly , Breakfast buffet was varied and provided choice for all Location good for transportation restaurants and nearby sights Be prepared to walk a lot if you are set to explore London 
144446,The Queens Gate Hotel,No Negative, Staff were very professional helpful efficient and friendly Food was very high quality Room was perfect comfortable bed and all facilities as described Breakfast was defiantly worth taking Perfect location for the Royal Albert Hall Close to South Kensington and Gloucester Road tube station Excellent stay 
144447,The Queens Gate Hotel,No Negative, The property was central for the Royal Albert Hall Science Museum etc close but not too close to the underground Friendly staff Fluffy white towels and all the toiletries you could need 
144448,The Queens Gate Hotel, This was close to the smallest hotel room I was ever in The distance between the end of the bed and the wall was about 18 There was nowhere to put our luggage and we travel with only carryon A big suitcase would have been a show stopper But my biggest gripe is about the desk staff The first morning we only had one towel Eventually we found the other in the wardrobe The second morning there was only one towel and none in the wardrobe We told the desk about the problem and went out to breakfast Came back no towel Told them again and left for the day Finally after telling them a third time someone in housekeeping left a towel on the bed How hard is it to go and get an extra towel and hand it to the guest , We loved the location of this hotel It is in a residential area but very near tourist attractions such as museums has good tube access including access to Heathrow and has good restaurants in walking distance 
144449,The Queens Gate Hotel, No horel specific parking and I had not noted this when I booked so had to incur unplanned parking costs, Clean easy access to central London but also abut away from excessive traffic
144450,The Queens Gate Hotel, The room was too small and I would have preferred to stay somewhere closer to a metro station because due to the distance we never used it Spent a lot on Uber s to get back from everything Also the bartender had a bad attitude and the food in bar was not good , The breakfast was very good good for walking to Victoria and Albert fine distance to bus 
144451,The Queens Gate Hotel, The service in the bar was slow and poor , Great location for Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park and we had a lovely peaceful newly refurbished room at the back of the hotel with excellent bed and en suite Emil was also very helpful at check in and check out 
144452,The Queens Gate Hotel, The walls between some rooms are not very sound proof but not dramatically so The nearest Tube station is a ten to fifteen minutes walk away which might be a problem with heavy luggage , The hotel has an unbeatable location if you have a concert in the Royal Albert Hall to attend or just wish to explore South Kensington and Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens It is clean and comfortable and a very pretty old building of course refurbished and modernised 
144453,The Queens Gate Hotel, Room was very small for 2 people and a lot of luggage , Appointments were very nice loved the double shower Bed was stiff but bedding was high quality 
144454,The Queens Gate Hotel, Very creaky bed shower from room above leaked through to our bathroom Needs better attention to maintenance Surprised Wifi was not a secure network but at least it was free , Was expecting a lot more for a 4 star hotel and the price Bit run down needs refurb Breakfast buffet not as good as Premier Inn However great location 
144455,The Queens Gate Hotel, Rooms tiny bit small inc bathroom but we ll furshied everything you might want , Great Location staff pleasant all very easy Breakfast good book when there as cheaper 
144456,The Queens Gate Hotel, Bathroom too small Breakfast very very average Had to wait for food to be cooked buffet style Very small bed Housekeeping not very thorough, Bar staff were pleasant
144457,The Queens Gate Hotel, The Room was the smallest Hotel Room I have every stayed in not at all like the sizes shown in Hotel literature The foot of the bed was so close to the wall that to get passed we had to turn sideways and slide through ducking to miss hitting head on the TV that is mounted on the wall at this point The Bathroom was minuscule with a stuck plug in the sink which I fixed but it then let Sewer smells into the Room unhygienic and dangerous the toilet roll holder was positioned under the sink and was broken The shower was so small that any movement inside it sprung the door open flooding the floor and also caused user to hit temp control changing temperature DANGEROUS When I reported the above it was met with indifference For the money this was a disgusting Ripoff Staying here spoilt our visit to London Will NEVER stay here again would Definitely NOT Recommend , Location
144458,The Queens Gate Hotel, The first night we were in the smallest room I have ever seen We asked to move and we re accommodated with a much more comfortable room at the same price , The staff were great
144459,The Queens Gate Hotel, The bed a little worn TV close to bottom of the bed having to bend every time to walk past, Excellent hotel for Albert Hall Hyde Park and Kensington Palace plus museums
144460,The Queens Gate Hotel, No Baileys at the bar , The hotel is clean well presented and has a fresh modern interior The location was ideal for us to visit the Albert Hall V A Museum 
144461,The Queens Gate Hotel, Only 1 British plug point plenty European Kettle had to be boiled on table next to bed Cupboard only 20cm from corner of bed with glass corner Accident waiting to happen , Friendly staff and helpful
144462,The Queens Gate Hotel, I think the room would be far too hot and stuffy in the summer The bathroom could do with an overhaul broken floor tiles and loose fittings, Very comfy bed clean and good breakfast excellent value for money The main plus was the friendliness and helpful staff 
144463,The Queens Gate Hotel, We was fully satisfied with everything Location to the Royal Albert hall , The bed was amazingly comfortable and we were at the back of the hotel no view but have to say it was really quiet and peaceful 
144464,The Queens Gate Hotel, Not one thing, Booked hotel to visit RAH Excellent situated for this visit Everything about hotel excellent from checking in until check out with Vangelis Showed us to brilliant room spacious and very quite Special thanks to barman for excellent service Ate in hotel and fish and chips were very good praise indeed since I live up north
144465,The Queens Gate Hotel, Breakfast satisfactory but unfortunately on a buffet service the food has to be kept hot and can deteriorate rubbery eggs However there was plenty of choice , Room recently renovated Spotlessly clean Nice bathroom with large shower cubicle Reception staff were particularly helpful to us
144466,The Queens Gate Hotel, Was disappointed Reviews had been great but room very small for value Very low bed No bathroom counter Drains were slow sink drain broken and had terrible smell slimey No point saying anything as would have to move rooms Defeats purpose of settling in after very long travel day with lots of luggage for 5 weeks of travel This just should never happen Rooms should be top notch upon arrival with all expectations met Clean but not spotless , Location for Kensington excellent Staff helpful 
144467,The Queens Gate Hotel, There was nothing that I didn t like I would stay there again although there were several other hotels in the area which seemed to have good rates , The front desk was very helpful in obtaining a private driver to the airport This is a residential neighborhood with many restaurants nearby very classy neighborhood with a good vibe Close to the tube and the Victoria and Alert museum and museum of Natural History A mere 15 20 minute walk to Harrod s I did not decide to try the breakfast as it seemed more than I wanted to eat but I bought yogurt and fruit from a nearby grocery and kept it in the in room refrigerator I was given room 4 which is considered a club room which had 2 cozy bathrobes and slippers chocolates and bottled water although there was NO view When I returned I was in room 512 which was very adequate and had a window which opened giving a slight view of London Very satisfactory and quiet 
144468,The Queens Gate Hotel, The bathroom smelled moist Probably because the vent was not located above the shower The double beds consist of two single beds these will slide apart if you sit lay in the middle of them , Bathrooms were newly renovated the staff was very service minded and breakfast was nice although pricey The hotel is very central and about 10 minutes from the closest subway station Quiet neighborhood 
144469,The Queens Gate Hotel, Described in the profile as elegant stylish and recently refurbished we were deeply disappointed to find The Queens Gate was none of that There was a bit of surface prettiness but in general the rooms were somewhat shabby and scuffed with a strange odor when windows were open The rooms vary in size some with lots of space but too little room to put away small items Not a single drawer in the bedroom or bath We were adequately comfortable in our rooms but The Queen s Gate was too basic for our tastes A move was discussed but inertia and a full seven day schedule won out , Well situated on a lovely street in Kensington with easy access to Hyde Park the Underground and walks to the V A The front desk staff particularly Marta were available responsive and effective problem solvers Queen s Gate was well priced but we would have been happy to spend more in a hotel with higher standards and more comfortable amenities 
144470,The Queens Gate Hotel, The hot breakfast could have been fresh by order instead of sitting congealing eggs in particular under covers , Only ate breakfast there Was fairly good not excellent tho 
144471,The Queens Gate Hotel, On checkin we ended up in the third room that we were given since all rooms smelled of sewer gas The room we stayed in also had the odour as well as smoking smell from other guests although the hotel is supposed to be non smoking , The reservations manager was most kind in providing a small refund for our inconvenience and disappointment in our stay 
144472,The Queens Gate Hotel, I liked everything , Very friendly and accommodating staff Safe and secure Nice neighborhood Just a great experience Really cool feature was a local cell phone that we took with us all over the city and even to Cardiff for the day which was quite handy Also it s called a handy phone 
144473,The Queens Gate Hotel, Breakfast was a bit chaotic the food was very good but the layout meant that guests had little room for maneuvering around the various dishes It would be better against a longer wall or lose a couple of table rows and increase the areas of footfall around the food , We were upgraded to a Townhouse Room on arrival and because I told reception staff it was our wedding anniversary they sent up a desert for us to share very thoughtful There was a mobile phone in the room which was specifically for us to take around London with free wi fi calls to the UK and many worldwide There was a super coffee machine the bathroom was great shower very powerful room very quiet despite being at the front There is a lot of attention to detail in this hotel and the porter who brought our bags was very attentive he showed us all the facilities in the main bedroom and in the bathroom We would definitely stay here again 
144474,The Queens Gate Hotel, Why did the air conditioning come on automatically at 5am and wake us up , Location was excellent for Royal Albert Hall and convenient for Underground Service for bar meal was excellent as we needed to have a quick meal before going out 
144475,The Queens Gate Hotel, Nothing really The overall room size was a touch on the small size but that s not unusual in central London hotels unless you pay a fortune On balance reasonable value for money , Friendly reception staff very comfy and spacious bed Excellent location for museums and parks and the underground 
144476,The Queens Gate Hotel, The breakfasts were poor the main reason being the food was not hot and people were kept waiting for some items of food to arrive at the buffet on the first day all of the fried eggs were over cooked and were like rubber ,No Positive
144477,The Queens Gate Hotel,No Negative, On arrival we were upgraded at no extra cost to a large room by Sarah the receptionist excellent The cooked breakfast although self service was hot and a good choice
144478,The Queens Gate Hotel, Can t think of anything , Staff efficient and very helpful Bed was extremely comfortable Above all the location in relation to the Royal Albert Hall is the best we have found over the many years we have attended concerts there Our room was both spacious and quiet 
144479,The Queens Gate Hotel, Nothing perfect in every way , Whole experience was fantastic received a free room upgrade upon arrival which made our stay even better Will certainly return to this wonderful hotel when visiting this area again 
144480,The Queens Gate Hotel, Breakfast Poor quality and expensive , Staff and room was excellent only criticism is that I wasn t impressed with the breakfast Tried it once and went elsewhere after that 
144481,The Queens Gate Hotel, Bar service very slow but that was only due to the fact only one member on duty and a busy busy bar, Receptionists very friendly and helpful A wonderful warm welcome 
144482,The Queens Gate Hotel,No Negative, Staff polite and friendly Our room was quiet clean very comfy bed and had everything we needed for our stay Convenient for RAH and hopefully book next time we go to see a concert 
144483,The Queens Gate Hotel, Original booking payment mess up was very disconcerting Considering we got upgraded for the inconvenience the room seemed no better than the average Holiday Inn rooms However I heard that the other rooms were likened to broom cupboards The room was very stark no floor coverings which meant the floor was slippery Lighting switches most confusing Not enough T bags only 2 The coffee machine was too complicated and not appreciated A small cafeti re would be better or decent instant coffee No dressing gowns In the bathroom there was no where to put towels if using the bath or shower A towel rail to dry and hold towels would be useful In the foyer there was a smell of cigarettes Breakfast food looked a little over cooked hard fried eggs , Comfy and spacious bed and room Room temperature was very pleasant Quiet No stairs so easy access Good hot water plenty of towels good shower Breakfast was OK 
144484,The Queens Gate Hotel, The food nearly cold breakfast Noisy breakfast room Ploughmans sandwich , The breakfast room was rather noisy as there was a constant banging and clattering of plates etc as staff were clearing replacing plates cutlery etc Breakfast was luke warm which was a shame as it was quite tasty and would have been so much better if it had been hot It would have been nice if there had been some biscuits with the tea and coffee in our room We ordered a ploughmans sandwich which was brought to our room and despite it being toasted it was cold and appeared that it had been sitting somewhere before eventually arriving at our room and after having waited 30 minutes for it which instigated a phone call to ask where it was it did not taste good 
144485,The Queens Gate Hotel, Room was extremely small Shower cubicle was very tiny with a leaking shower head Food was dried up at breakfast, Location was great for the Royal Albert Hall Room was clean Bed was comfortable
144486,The Queens Gate Hotel, The kettle lead was cut Bits of paint knocked off and not touched up Mould in the shower , The proximity to the Royal Albert Hall The staff were friendly 
144487,The Queens Gate Hotel, Wallpaper peeling scorch marks on bedside table soap dispenser did not work in bath , The location was excellent for our trip to the Royal Albert Hall there in 8 minutes and the staff were helpful
144488,The Queens Gate Hotel, We liked everything really At the risk of sounding picky breakfast was quite expensive so we didn t use this facility it would have been good to have had a continental option at a cheaper price However there were plenty of coffee shops nearby and tea coffee making facilities in the rooms , Great location in Queen s Gate easy walk to both tube and bus routes felt very safe even late at night Staff very helpful and smiley happy to look up bus tube times etc and to give directions Arrived around midday and we were able to check in to our room rather than leave bags in the luggage room really helpful as we were due to watch two theatre performances in the afternoon and evening and wouldn t be returning till midnight Room was well appointed boutique style with everything you could need including a fridge Excellent bathroom with amazing water pressure and plenty of toiletries fluffy towels Comfortable bed with loads of variations for the lighting 
144489,The Queens Gate Hotel, Same as above , When I booked through booking com they had two prices for a room one with breakfast one without I took the one with breakfast When I got to the hotel I found out the breakfast was free with any booking but I was charged 40 a day for two people I would like to know where that 40 a day went 
144490,The Queens Gate Hotel, unfortunately when we arrived our room had a leaking toilet and while it was being fixed we were not offered another room until I actually went down to reception to ask due to us going out for the evening so needed to get ready , the location is great for the Royal albert hall
144491,The Queens Gate Hotel, The breakfast was terrible food was luke warm and not replaced Three dried fried eggs sat on the hot plate for the time we were there Far from good , The location
144492,The Queens Gate Hotel, Not enough staff on in the bar had to wait 10 minutes before someone turned up and then he got my food order wrong so we had to wait again this was after the show at the royal Albert hall when they know it will be busy , it was brilliant for the royal Albert hall a 5 minute walk
144493,The Queens Gate Hotel, Lumpy pillows check them when you get there so gives you time to change them, Very friendly helpful staff fantastic location for the Royal Albert Hall
144494,The Queens Gate Hotel, Coffee was a bit ordinary but they did try to make a weak cappacino so full marks for trying , Hotel was just lovely staff very accommodating and friendly The location is excellent Gloucester Tube is nearby Hyde park and museums on your doorstop Will go there again 
144495,The Queens Gate Hotel,No Negative, Very comfy bed and windows that I could open despite being on the top floor It was a warm day and the fresh air was nicer than the air con Nice area and close to the Royal Albert Hall the tube and the Natural History Museum
144496,The Queens Gate Hotel, Some of the staff were excellent but the evening bar staff was very slow Also the bar food left a lot to be desired , The hotel was clean with an axcellent location 
144497,The Queens Gate Hotel, The cooked buffet breakfast was disappointing and not worth the money Cold bacon not very nice hash browns and burnt sausages that were lukewarm and generally unappetising The bread rolls and the muffins were nice though , Friendly and welcoming receptionist Location good for going to the Royal Albert Hall as we saw ABC there Sons room got upgraded so he was happy 
144498,The Queens Gate Hotel, The door to the room had several large scratches 1014 The mural behind the bed was damaged The bath had several chips and cracks in it The whole room had a tatty 1980s feel to it, Big bed
144499,The Queens Gate Hotel, The room felt a little cramped Hot water went off in the morning so cold showers all round The hotel did apologise and included free breakfast which was nice , It was in a great location for the Royal Albert Hall The staff seemed very friendly and willing to help when needed
144500,The Queens Gate Hotel, Other guests luggage was still in my room when I checked in rooms looked old and tired Bed was not clean stains on sheets not worth the money I paid not the room in the pictures I ended up with a really small room at the top, Staff were friendly
144501,The Queens Gate Hotel, The rooms are very tight and sometimes the view is not good , It s very pleasant hotel one of the best in that area The rooms are very clean and stuff is very friendly 
144502,The Queens Gate Hotel, Small room and bathroom Shower so small if you have a big belly you wouldn t get into it Toilet flush broke , Very good location for Royal Albert Hall
144503,The Queens Gate Hotel, Could have had some draught Cider in bar, WiFi was free so often have to pay that bugs me Good position close to the Albert Hall which is where we were going 
144504,The Queens Gate Hotel, Fortunately I m not a big man otherwise not sure how you fit in the shower It s tiny But worked well for me so all good , Comfortable and had a nice little desk to work good wifi
144505,The Queens Gate Hotel, No bottled water in the room and poor tasting coffee very small bathroom with the extractor not working , Excellent location for the purpose of our trip Polite and friendly staff A good lunch menu at a reasonable price Large and comfortable bed 
144506,The Queens Gate Hotel, Nothing at all, Friendly staff and professional throughout Room was ready at 12pm so they allowed me and my partner to check in early which was very helpful 
144507,The Queens Gate Hotel, Had to move rooms at 0110 Sunday morning as an intermittent vibrating noise like a hammer drill from an outside air conditioner made it impossible to sleep This was room 412 and seemed to be a known problem with that room Moved to room 1011 which was excellent Breakfast somewhat chaotic as there was a lengthy wait for certain items like bacon scrambled eggs and sausages Once all the items were available however it was a good breakfast , Very pleasant reception staff Night manager Pierre I believe was very helpful Location for the Royal Albert Hall couldn t be better 
144508,The Queens Gate Hotel, Check out was slow but did not put us off visiting this hotel again, We had a four bedded room which was fantastic so much room and the beds and bathroom were perfect for our needs
144509,The Queens Gate Hotel, Breakfast good with the exception of the plates could have been hotter , The nearness to The RAH and Kensington Palace which were the reason for our visit Ability to leave our luggage after checkout time until ready to set off for home 
144510,The Queens Gate Hotel, The room was a bit to small and there were not enough room to store my clothes I hope I will have a nicer room next time , The hotel provides a Handy phone in each room with which you can freely phone and use the internet That s very useful The breakfast is fantastic fresh and diverse 
144511,The Queens Gate Hotel, Wobbly plumbing in the bathroom , Excellent location despite lack of cafes or restaurant in the immediate proximity of the hotel Nice rooms comfortable beds 
144512,The Queens Gate Hotel, Waiter behind the bar also a bit stern could have been more relaxed , Lovely friendly young woman checking us out the young man checking us in a bit stern Small room but everything you need Very good value for money due to good price booked though booking com Great location 
144513,The Queens Gate Hotel, Cheap flooring made the room quite noisy Breakfast was expensive and although the food was fine it was not efficient They kept running out of hot breakfast options and oranges in the unnecessary juicing machine Queueing for tea and coffee was annoying and could ve been done table to table Breakfast was definite fail Oh and the pineapple juice was off, We were going to a concert at The Royal Albert Hall so the location was perfect We were able to book one room for four people and it was clean and comfortable although would ve preferred carpeted floor
144514,The Queens Gate Hotel, I have no negative comments to make Very pleased with the staff and the accommadations , The staff were extremely friendly and helpful running out to flag cabs for me offering advice on spots to visit booking theatre tickets for me etc The room was comfortable and spotless The meals I ate there were reasonably priced and enjoyable The location was ideal for my purposes

144517,The Queens Gate Hotel, Shower was cold in the morning told the main desk and they gave us a discount from the room, Breakfast was great Room was big enough for the two of us very well decorated and clean Great location from Hyde Park and the Royal Albert Hall Quick check in and out service 
144518,The Queens Gate Hotel, Faulty Towers everything is bad Room size and layout dreadful No hot water from when we arrived early evening until an hour or so before we left next morning When hotel reception informed we were laughed at Dreadful breakfast asked for 2 fried eggs as scrambled looked appealing these took approx 20 mins Very poor service from a hotel in an otherwise nice area of London ,No Positive
144519,The Queens Gate Hotel, Was quite a small room and bathroom, Friendly staff and when there was a fault with the shower it was dealt with immediately Was also really close for the royal albert hall
144520,The Queens Gate Hotel, The Bathroom sink did not drain properly I got stuck in the lift and nobody knew I was in there for 20 minutes Lucky I had my phone to call my mother to let someone know The TV did not work very well it was glitching most of the time ,No Positive

144523,The Queens Gate Hotel, I had booked a twin room for my mother and I On arrival quite late in the evening our twin room consisted of two single beds pushed together and made up as one double style bed I raised this with the receptionist on duty and asked if the beds could be separated which meant moving bedside tables lamps etc He looked in the room and abruptly told me that was a twin room he was not prepared to do anything about it as this was how twin rooms were in London and that I should look at the pictures on the website which displayed twin rooms as two single beds pushed together I informed him I had stayed in many twin rooms in London previously and this was not the case He again refused to do anything and left the room leaving us to try to separate then beds which was not possible due to the other bedroom furniture being secured in the way so I had to share the bed with my mum which was not what I had paid for or what we expected I checked the website and twin rooms are displayed as seperate beds I will not stay at this hotel again and if you want a twin room I would not stay at this hotel either ,No Positive

144545,The Queens Gate Hotel, Did not have breakfast because it was not included in my booking and it was a bit too pricey Maybe worth adding a small affordable breakfast option , Good location Queen s gate is central but quiet and allows you to walk both to the park and to South Kensington Huge rooms I was alone but the room had 3 beds and very comfortable environment 
144546,The Queens Gate Hotel, When we arrived the lights in our room did not work Several members of staff were involved and the process took about 45mins We were told there were other rooms available but they wouldn t relocate us After several trips to and from our room with all our luggage due to the confusion refusal of the maintenance guy to get involved one encounter with a rude member of staff and confusion over whether the free drink for the hassle included alcohol or not we were finally back in our room with working lights The hotel did then provide a fruit basket for the inconvenience however overall I felt they dealt with the whole experience very badly , The d cor and the bar area were lovely 
144547,The Queens Gate Hotel, The air conditioner was tricky Apparently the front desk controls the functionality We realized the window was operable the second night , The bed was so comfortable The window opened for fresh air 
144548,The Queens Gate Hotel, Unfortunately the bar staff later in the evening were more interested in playing the TV as loudly as possible for their own benefit than making sure we could enjoy a nice peaceful nightcap I think the manager had gone home for the night , Good sized room for this part of London so very good value

144560,The Queens Gate Hotel, Upon checkin we were offered a room on the fourth floor as we requested with twin beds and a quiet room When we got to the room we were overcome by the stench of faeces and one double bed even though upon checkin we discussed the twin beds and this was confirmed Immediately we went back to reception as we could not bare the smell We were then given a room on the ground floor behind the bar as this was the only one available We did indicate this was going to be incredibly noisy which was the case during the night Also the water was cold At checkout we expressed our disappointment to staff especially for the price we paid but there was no goodwill gesture offered I will definitely not be staying here again or recommend to anyone , Comfortable beds and spacious room
144561,The Queens Gate Hotel, Tiny room Breakfast was acceptable but nothing amazing Get your own coffee from a machine Cafeteria style rather than dinning room , Location was superb Very close to the Albert Hall 
144562,The Queens Gate Hotel, no complimentary water This was my third or fourth stay and I think the last Instead of a welcome back and perhaps an upgrade I got a tiny room different than the specific floor I requested I was in town for one night and had forgotten my phone chargers Staff couldn t help and more or less had a sort yourself out attitude until I sourced one which needed an adapter they let me use theirs while telling me twice that this is the staff s property and not the hotels , Location
144563,The Queens Gate Hotel, I expected more from the family room the picture and room bookings made it sound like it was a room for four and not three with an extra bed squeezed I would expect more space and larger beds for the money even in London I feel the information was slightly misleading on booking com I asked another guest what they thought the pictures looked like and they said it looked like three double beds not three singles The staff were helpful and sorted the extra bed when we arrived , The location was perfect for the activities we had planned the hotel was quiet 
144564,The Queens Gate Hotel, They should be serving fresh milk at breakfast Also I was disappointed that there were no sausages with the cooked breakfast , The beds were very comfortable and there was no noise to spoil our sleep 
144565,The Queens Gate Hotel, Beds not very comfortable Was it a shower or was it a bath In fact it was neither Small and high sided I do not understand why hotels do not have a nice shower instead of a non bath non shower , Excellent situation for Royal Albert Hall

144569,The Queens Gate Hotel, We were disturbed overnight Thursday Friday early hours by two men presumably guests who spoke overly loudly in the corridor waking us up entered the adjoining bedroom where they proceeded to move furniture on a wooden floor causing more noise and continued their very loud conversation which we could plainly hear in our bedroom They then left the room banging the door only to return some 20 minutes or so later repeating their previous behaviour Very annoying and disruptive of our sleep Therefore the efficiency of the sound insulation is questionable I mentioned the incident to the receptionist the following morning and requested that she have a word with our fellow guests There was no repetition of the disturbance overnight Friday Saturday The room s decor was tired and the window frame was rotten so needs attention Only other disappointment was quality of coffee at breakfast and stale mini croissants , I appreciated the fact that the Hotel management took pains to satisfy my wish list in that the bed was comfortable it was at the rear of the 5th floor and therefore a quiet situation 
144570,The Queens Gate Hotel, A comfortable chair in the bedroom would have been nice We were very concerned about the sash windows in the bedrooms they opened from the bottom with no guard and we were on the 4th floor I m sure this is a Health Safety issue , Excellent location for the Albert Hall 
144571,The Queens Gate Hotel, Wifi And no breakfast but visited partridges around the corner for excellent coffee and pasties Would highly recommend a visit there , Room size good and bed very comfy Wifi didn t work No breakfast in cost of room Visit Jacobs for lunch Excellent food Great vegetarian choices

144584,The Queens Gate Hotel, The size of the room You could have got two Queens Gate rooms into one Premier Inn , We booked a twin room and it was so tiny we had to walk sideways at the bottom of the beds to get to the other side We could only half open the fridge door because it touched the end of the bed Beautifully clean and pleasant staff 
144585,The Queens Gate Hotel, This is not a value for money hotel Expensive for what it offers For the same amount of money spent I am sure you can find a better hotel We will only return to this hotel if prices drop Also cleaning could improve , The room was really spacious and beds very comfortable Great location if you want to visit Hyde park the Natural History Museum Harrods and other attractions

144590,The Queens Gate Hotel, Pretty grim looking shower cubicle and shower head in room 517 worked ok but not a pleasant experience Needs replacing Breakfast room needs a manager to direct staff and ensure that there is enough food available Would also benefit from reorganising the layout of items available as it is not logical people were going backwards and forwards in a very small place to get what they wanted Quite dangerous too Food was good quality but we were disappointed by several empty containers and apparently no attempt to replenish just looked bad A wait to be seated sign might help as several people bypassed the log in desk as there was no one there It didn t feel like a 16 per head experience , Excellent location for Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park Comfortable bed
144591,The Queens Gate Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location Professional and Friendly staff modern and clean bedrooms Bed really comfy quiet rooms although being in City centre Great for business and I could also see it being great for leisure Would definitely book it again Thank you hotel team

144603,The Queens Gate Hotel, Room was loud from both street noise and noise from the corridor from both staff and other guests When you lifted the plug in the bathroom sink it smelled of sewage Bed was not comfy at all very hard The thermostat controlled the air con unit but the radiator did what it wanted When people from other floors flushed toilets or had showers and when the heating came on and off we could hear the water running through the walls and pipes so not a good night sleep at all Very expensive and massively needs updating , The only real positive was the location because we were seeing a show at the Royal Albert Hall it was a very short walk which is the only reason we chose the hotel Would not stay again
144604,The Queens Gate Hotel, During this one night stay couldn t say there was anything I didn t like , The size of the bedroom is very much appreciated by single travellers as well as the cleanliness And of course the proximity within 10 walking distance to the Royal Albert Hall

144647,The Queens Gate Hotel, I didn the like the laminate flooring It made the room feel functional rather than luxurious in any way There were drinks in the mini bar that we couldn t open as there was no bottle opener There wasn t one available so we had to go down to the bar to get the drinks open No one offered to come up The room could do with a lick of paint Not much better than a travelodge Disappointed overall , Location was good

144653,The Queens Gate Hotel, Nothing, We came for a weekend away to celebrate my birthday and was not disappointed we have visited London many times but this hotel is situated in a beautiful part of London South Kensigton The staff are lovely we will be back 
144654,The Queens Gate Hotel, The rates are far too high for what you get Bedroom was so small that the suitcase would not fit between the bed and the desk and we had to haul it over the bed to get it onto the stand Only one chair no table no saucers for the cups the bath is too high and difficult to get into it for a shower Breakfast is 16 pound p p Extra Can do a lot better Don t order a taxi from the hotel it s a rip off , I liked the decor of the hotel

144661,The Queens Gate Hotel, Breakfast good but very expensive OK expect that in London but Premier Inn just as good at 8 95 16 a lot of money for virtually the same as Premier serve for much less, Near to the Royal Albert Hall
144662,The Queens Gate Hotel, Breakfast was good lots of choice cereals fruit fresh orange juice toast etc The only slight disappointment was that the quite comprehensive hot breakfast on offer was not very hot in fact it was cool on our first morning This was a shame because it tasted very nice It was better the second morning when we were an hour earlier Maybe it could be kept hotter for longer , Everything in the room was spotlessly clean and the beds were among the most comfortable we have experienced in London during many short breaks The location in this part of London is ideal for the Royal Albert Hall our visit was to attend two concerts at the BBC Proms a five minute walk Also the Natural History Museum is just at the bottom of the road and the Science Museum and the V A are just a street away It is also a relatively quiet area and once we were in the well sound proofed room we could hear virtually nothing outside Also the staff were very helpful friendly and polite We will certainly stay there again for our next visit to the area 
144663,The Queens Gate Hotel, There were no aspects I was unhappy with , Excellent hotel Easy to get to from Heathrow as the hotel is only about a 6 minute walk from Gloucester Road tube station The rooms were large clean very comfortable quiet at night and very well appointed I did a day trip with Golden Tours and was able to walk to their office to start the trip and at the end of the day everybody was dropped off at Gloucester Road tube station to make their own way back to their hotels I really enjoyed staying here and would highly recommend it 
144664,The Queens Gate Hotel, Expensive breakfast at 16 per person when the kids only eat toast cereal so we didn t try it , Great location and the family room was fantastic with a partition wall between giving the kids aged 6 and 4 the feeling of a separate room 
144665,The Queens Gate Hotel, INothing to do with hotel which was great but I was sure I booked a triple room with breakfast for me my wife and 5 year old son for 7 days whilst in London However when we arrived I was informed the booking was only for a twin room The hotel was very helpful and offered to put in another bed for my son free of charge but had to pay for his breakfast but the room was far too cramped for 3 of us so I had to pay 30 extra each night to upgrade and include breakfast for my son This may have been an error by me on the booking com website but I would not have purposely booked a twin room for 3 people Fairly annoying after a 20 hour flight though , Good service and very helpful staff Great location too 
144666,The Queens Gate Hotel, The position of the flat screen t v on the back wall effectively behind two of the beds was a little strange , The location of the hotel is very convenient The room was very clean The family room was very big and spacious

144669,The Queens Gate Hotel, Not sure there was anything we did not like although we did not eat there , Great location for museums Hyde park and Kensington Palace Easy to access and located near to tube 
144670,The Queens Gate Hotel, The location of the loo was not ideal in our bathroom as there was not much room either side so it was a bit of a squash , The location so close to the Albert Hall the museums Hyde Park and not too far from the Underground made this an ideal location for a short break The extra large bed was exceptionally comfortable and ideal for two not so small people 
144671,The Queens Gate Hotel, Wish breakfast had been a little cheaper 16 each didn t feel worth it, 3 minute walk from the Royal Albert Hall and so close to museums in a beautiful part of London Staff delightful room modern and spacious with nice touches like air con bathrobes 2 showers reading lights We had a delightful stay 
144672,The Queens Gate Hotel, Hair on the toilet when we arrived paper in the toilet complimentary chocolates had been opened and one was missing room service meal was burnt had to keep hand basin plug in because of a smell presumably coming from the pipes we noticed this outside when we walked past drains too so maybe the whole area has a problem , Beds were extremely comfortable location perfect we were going to an event at Hyde Park friendly staff
144673,The Queens Gate Hotel, It was an extremely small room it had everything that was needed but I would expect more space in a twin bedded room for 2 people , Very convenient location for the Royal Albert Hall plus there were restaurants bars close by Staff were very friendly Bed was comfortable 
144674,The Queens Gate Hotel, The room could have been cleaned better Bugers were smeared on wall next to bed Someone s hair band on found on the headboard of bed Bathroom was very clean tho , The staff was wonderful Made us feel very welcome and answered all our questions 
144675,The Queens Gate Hotel, The staff certainly could have been better The internet was terrible Location a bit too far from the tube station The bathroom wasn t that clean and the shower needed some serious repairs as the doors didn t close, In a nice quiet part of town
144676,The Queens Gate Hotel, We found the room below par Few chips and cracks around and air conditioning machine made some strange noises during the night The gym although suitable was a great deal smaller than the website leads one to believe , Excellent location and I mean excellent Only a stone s throwaway from some of the best parts of London including Harrods the Science Museum Natural History Museum and Hyde Park Beautiful Georgian steeped houses away from the bustle and the part of town were supercars roam about 
144677,The Queens Gate Hotel, Break fast was disappointing hot food was cold and congealed Bathroom water was only luke warm , Very convenient for Albert hall Hyde Park and public transport Very comfortable beds Very polite staff 
144678,The Queens Gate Hotel, No complaints , The hotel is not fancy but it is in a charming old London town home in Kensington a ten minute walk to the Gloucester street tube station and just up from Gloucester Road itself which is filled with places to eat and a hop on hop off stop The room was plain but clean and comfortable with a very modern bathroom The staff was helpful and friendly Breakfast was not complimentary and on the high side so we ate elsewhere Overall no frills but quite good for the price in a good part of London 
144679,The Queens Gate Hotel, Having to pay for bottle of still water in room which in my experience is usually complimentary in hotels of that standard , Staff were very helpful and polite Location is great for Royal Albert Hall 
144680,The Queens Gate Hotel, i dont see the value of money in comparison to the extreme simplicity of facilities and services available at the hotel, clean hotel excellent location close to knightsbridge and hyde park efficient for a short stay recommended for someone who has been in london previously
144681,The Queens Gate Hotel, The buffet breakfast was good but the cooked bacon and egg dishes were a little over done and not as fresh as I would have liked it, The beds were very comfortable and clean staff very friendly and helpful rooms all had tea and coffee making facilities with a small drinks fridge
144682,The Queens Gate Hotel, my room was awful it had a small window which was frosted over so it was dark and depressing I felt like I was sleeping in someones basement I think for what I paid 650 AUD a night I could of got a window when I asked the front desk if there was another room I was told no , great location
144683,The Queens Gate Hotel, The bathrooms were small and could have been a little cleaner There was some mold that should have been attended to Also the workmanship in some areas was not up to par , The location was great The staff was friendly Claudio was a wonderful bartender Beds and linens were comfortable and well appreciated at the end of a long day 
144684,The Queens Gate Hotel, This is a petty negative but being served warmed UHT milk with tea is just not on , This is the 2nd time we ve stayed at Queens Gate Previously we were just in a standard room whereas this time we stayed in club room The difference between the rooms was significant and helped us to have an even more enjoyable stay at the hotel this time The biggest bonus for us was the black out curtains which allowed for a really good night s sleep The bigger room and more spacious bathroom were also handy 
144685,The Queens Gate Hotel, I can t think of anything negative to say about this hotel My stay was only 1 night , This hotel is excellent for The Royal Albert Hall only 5 minutes walk which is the reason I chose it I found the staff are all very friendly Breakfast at the hotel is Buffet Style This means lots of choices and you can go back for more Good valve for the price I would certainly stay here again 
144686,The Queens Gate Hotel, We forgot a bag of shoppings vinyl records from HMV and it was lost when a friend would have fetched it for us Only 2 bath towels for 3 No place to dry wet shoes , Beds were excellent and the room was silent We slept like happy babies 
144687,The Queens Gate Hotel, The bathroom needs a little attention We did advise the reception staff when checking out that the extractor fan wasn t working if it had one Also there was a broken tile in the middle of the bathroom floor , The bed was extra comfy 
144688,The Queens Gate Hotel, Breakfast is disappointing Hot food put out early on and looks very dry Breakfast room not in keeping with the rest of the hotel Staff clearing the table plates etc with great alacrity when you are not quite finished Should be trained to ask first , Decent size and comfortable bedroom Reception and bar staff friendly and helpful

144696,The Queens Gate Hotel, Nothing just keep doing what you do, Staff were helpful from time we arrived to leaving Very quite for London and only 6 mins from Royal Albert hall Room and bed very comfortable 
144697,The Queens Gate Hotel, Not a fault of the hotel we just never figured out how to take a shower without flooding the floor of the bathroom No shower curtain and only 1 short glass panel to keep water in ,No Positive

144701,The Queens Gate Hotel, The second day into our stay they had construction going on outside our day ALL day loud people stomping in and out The staff was nice until our last morning when the guy at the desk refused to let me pay for a coke I used after we had checked out He had a very heavy accent and I kept thinking he s not understanding me but I think he was just a snob , The room was really nice and clean 
144702,The Queens Gate Hotel, The WiFi would quit working at times which was frustrating when researching activities to do the next day , The best part of The Queens Gate hotel was the staff Everyone was so nice and helpful Also the rooms were very comfortable We really enjoyed our stay 
144703,The Queens Gate Hotel, Walls in corridor were a little shabby as was the finish to much of the decoration However the rooms were clean and comfortable although the carpet was dirty stained near the tea coffee making facilities , The bed was very comfortable The room was at the back of the hotel so the view was poor however the lack of view was more than made up for by the quiet 
144704,The Queens Gate Hotel, Poor cleaning at arrival Got better after a while , Location Very helpful and serviceminded personnel at reception desc Comfortable and spatious rooms 3 beds 
144705,The Queens Gate Hotel, Nothing it was a very nice hotel We didn t have breakfast there but it looked like it was offered in a room below street level with no windows , Very nice and helpful staff very comfortable beds rooms quite spacious and tastefully decorated Good location for Kensington Gardens V A Museum Albert Hall Harrods etc Gloucester Road with many restaurants just a few minutes walk

144709,The Queens Gate Hotel, Breakfast items were a bit overcooked for the full English but the rest was very good, Excellent location for Royal Albert Hall and museums and great value on the deal we had so ended up staying an extra night Bed was extremely comfortable and the room was well appointed Used the bar a couple of times and staff there and at reception were superb 
144710,The Queens Gate Hotel, It was all fab , I took my young daughter to see Swan Lake at the Albert Hall and we stayed the night afterwards at this hotel The staff were all absolutely lovely to my daughter and me they couldn t have been more welcoming had put a Happy Birthday mini cheesecake in our room and gave her some colouring pens when we left 
144711,The Queens Gate Hotel, The room I was allocated was so small that it was challenging to get around the bed especially due the placement of the television on a wall bracket Practically put my back out every time I tried to navigate the obstacle course , Location is good for museums the park and Kensington
144712,The Queens Gate Hotel, let us stay for longer but alas work calls to save for another visit , The friendly helpful staff The location of the hotel The bedroom was amazing plenty of room which was a bonus for London

144714,The Queens Gate Hotel, The room is not decorated missing some style and perhaps nice pictures on the wall View from Room 106 is not recommended only backyard and walls Stiff price for is room 4 stars is exaggerated , Good location clean rooms friendly staff Wonderful neighborhood with direct connection on Piccadilly line to Heathrow and city centre 
144715,The Queens Gate Hotel, Shower over bath not suitable for older people as bath very high for getting in and out , Room on 3rd floor was large Surprisingly quiet given traffic and black out curtains meant not awakened at dawn Great to be able to walk to Kensington Palace gardens and to Natural History Museum Perfect location for us as going to the Albert Hall for a concert 
144716,The Queens Gate Hotel,No Negative, This was my 3rd 4th time staying at this hotel and each time I fall in love a little more we had a beautiful twin room on the 5th floor with phenomenal views of the sunset the beds were like laying on fluffy clouds The room it s self just felt comforting We stayed in London for 5 nights and this hotel for 2 of the 5 We will definitely be staying here again soon 
144717,The Queens Gate Hotel, The tile grouting needs attention as does the scuffed paintwork They no longer accept checks but I think they meant cheques , The staff we very helpful and nothing was too much trouble 
144718,The Queens Gate Hotel, Thought there would be a proper restaurant instead it was bar menus Room very tight at end of bed Better planning by centre unit changed to corner Shower good but on the small side , Location for the Royal Albert Hall Excellent Meal at the bar excellent 
144719,The Queens Gate Hotel, bathroom while superficially clean could have done with a deep clean I woul hve liked a better choice of eggs for breakfast But this is me being very very picky , Fantastic staff very friendly and efficient Close proximity to the Royal Albert Hall Comfy bed Being able to eat late at the bar 
144720,The Queens Gate Hotel, Outside dirty Room small cramped could not even walk around bed Room grubby dirty Bathroom shower moldy Breakfast poor Not value for money 2 start not 4 star,No Positive
144721,The Queens Gate Hotel, Room 1 if they offer it change it Noisy room as it has hotel work yard and bar garden right outside drilling at 9am and people talking very loudly until late with a kitchen fan directly under room that comes to life at 6 30am Not impressed Booked a twin room and was given a triple after booking for two nights and being told they hadn t got one booking when I had spoken to hotel reception directly on phone I was told they were full and they seemed to shove us in this room1 and that we may have to change rooms on 2nd night which had been booked since December Staff were ok Need more training I think Phoned to ask them to book a taxi as it was pouring down and was told all the roads were closed and that I would be better off hailing one down outside not very professional I managed to hail one down in two mins but usually the concierge do this for you On checking out We weren t asked if we had enjoyed our stay and when we were in the middle of checking out the chap dealing with us answered the phone and left us standing there mid transaction Another BIG no no in hotel etiquette Felt totally let down Could have stayed at a travel lodge for half the cost and had exactly the same experience Breakfast is not worth 16 either nothing special not even an offer of a pot of tea This review may sound a bit negative but when you are used to staying in hotels on London and get a dud you have to tell people , The location ideal for museums and Albert hall
144722,The Queens Gate Hotel, Pillows were poor quality and the decor of the room was not in keeping with the building Could do with pictures on the wall and carpet Also the room was very small and did not feel very clean water marks on the bedside tables , Bed was comfortable and shower was good Good location as was within walking distance to the tube station and the Albert Hall 
144723,The Queens Gate Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly and polite staff lovely and clean throughout Position ideal for our visit to the Royal Albert Hall Only down side was that breakfast was not included in price of over 200 per night 
144724,The Queens Gate Hotel, Quite expensive but this is my opinion Extractor fan not working meaning bathroom was steamy in the morning , Very central a few minutes from tube and good restaurants Bar was appealing very cosy Buffet breakfast was excellent Proximity to Albert Hall 
144725,The Queens Gate Hotel, Staff with exception of the young lady on reception were abrupt and off hand very slow in bar dining area Food was poor Room was average not 4star Although we received a leyter of apology from the manager after our first night of problems we noticed no difference in the attitude if the reception staff or bar dining staff last night , Location We stayed 3 night hotel in a lovely area close to Albert Hall and Kensington gardens hence the 4 stars obviously And fact Manager acknowledged our issue re food and service in bar dining room On our first night there On reading my review on trip adviser and after i told lovely girl on reception about our problem the previous night a letter of apology was waiting for us along with a gift for both myself and my mother on our return to our room last night Apart from that wont be returning 
144726,The Queens Gate Hotel, I didn t particularly like the heavy duvet It was a smallish room so quite stuffy , It was situated very near Royal Albert Hall where I was going for a concert So was very pleased with the location 
144727,The Queens Gate Hotel, Drinks at bar very strange Bloody Marys sold with 6 carrots olives and whole baby tomatoes never had this before should be celery etc and spicy champagne flat and warm, The bed linen and beds were wonderful
144728,The Queens Gate Hotel, nothing, Hotel very convenient for Royal Albert Hall the park and the South Kensington Museums Staff were very kind and helpful as I had mobility difficulties
144729,The Queens Gate Hotel, We arrived at the hotel in checking time but our room was not ready They told us that we have to wait for 10 min My wife got very upset and the staff changed our room and we checked in The room was smelling breakfast in the morning it was noisy the internet was not working properly , Location is very good staff was very professional and very friendly The room was nice and clean The bed was very comfortable 
144730,The Queens Gate Hotel, The Queen s Gate Street is quite busy and the noise from the street could disturb your sleep Some rooms are located below the street level , A very nice hotel in a perfect location The room was spacious comfortable and equipped with complimentary cofee and tea making facilities The bed was big and very comfortable The stuff was very nice and helpful The breakfast was rich and diverse I absolutely reccomend this hotel 
144731,The Queens Gate Hotel, Coffee tea supplies in room were very sparse and no biscuits The room cleaner spoke no English so we could not discuss our requirements with her , Friendly service 
144732,The Queens Gate Hotel, The room was a bit on the small side though probably normal for mid price London Breakfast coffee offered was only frothy from a machine or cheap Nescaf Some decent filter coffee would have been nice given that breakfasts cost 16 , Very convenient for The Albert Hall and big museums Reasonable value for London 
144733,The Queens Gate Hotel, Smelly bathroom drains , Quiet room on 5th floor at the back Helpful staff Room service meal huge fish and potato wedges Lots of choice for breakfast 
144734,The Queens Gate Hotel, Breakfast was far too expensive so we went elsewhere It just isn t necessary to charge 16 especially if guests only want continental breakfast Minibar prices are silly Why does a small bottle of water have to cost 2 75 Ridiculous , Excellent location perfect for the Albert Hall South Kensington museums and Hyde Park The hotel staff are very welcoming and our room was comfortable and nicely designed 
144735,The Queens Gate Hotel, Menu somewhat limited for this type of hotel expectation of more sophistication relative to the room cost That said what I had I enjoyed very much, Staff were all friendly and professional
144736,The Queens Gate Hotel, Lack of snack and food availability later at night especially after a concert food finished at 11 30pm Maybe sandwiches chocolate crisps etc could be available from a reasonably priced vending machine You could even provide a sandwich plate for residents after a concert This could be ordered before residents leave for the night as an additional service , Quick checking in Cleanliness of room Very comfortable bed Cheerful reception from staff when we arrived 
144737,The Queens Gate Hotel, Room 209 was very dirty Dusty everywhere bathroom sink dirty and the whole room needed a good overall clean Breakfast very poor limited choice and poor quality food , Location was the best bit about this hotel as we were going to The Royal Albert Hall in the evening and it took us 3 minutes to walk there Bar area very nice we ate lunch here on arrival Food was excellent and staff very professional Also sat on the small terrace in the evening having a drink 
144738,The Queens Gate Hotel, The person who checked us in was rude The room looked tired and a little shabby The duvet cover wasn t clean , Location excellent Easy to get everywhere 
144739,The Queens Gate Hotel, We booked months ago for a family room as 2 adults 2 children Our room was not ready till 3 15pm because they gave us a triple room so staff had to put an extra bed in there for us , The location as near the Royal Albert Hall 
144740,The Queens Gate Hotel, I thought the bedroom and bathroom too small for two people Also I thought the breakfast was somewhat disappointing and not great value for money , The location was really good The staff were excellent 
144741,The Queens Gate Hotel, Wifi was weak at best on the top floor better on the ground floor but use of the two Apple PC s made up for it , Very short walk around to the Albert Hall clean and tidy stopover venue Museums are just around the corner too with Knightsbridge shopping and eating 15 minutes walk away 
144742,The Queens Gate Hotel,No Negative, The staff were always available to help with any inquiries in a pleasant and professional manner The room was cleaned quickly first thing in the morning Nice to return to after breakfast 
144743,The Queens Gate Hotel, Only minor things window did not lock some ants at bathroom sewer smell sometimes at bathroom Bathroom lightswitch should be inside because of the noice of ventilation on when in bathroom TV needs update and HD channels not small at 32 but you know , Silent room at top floor Good cleaning bed compty ok size for a room at London standards 10 min walk from tube Hyde park near 
144744,The Queens Gate Hotel, Very unhappy with the room the marketing image for the club room was completely misleading Having looked at 3 seperate rooms they were all gloomy dated and very poorly considered for guests , The location is great and Victor on reception was very keen to help

144747,The Queens Gate Hotel, The bed was a small double that creaked a lot which resulted in a very bad nights sleep The bathroom was very small with hairs on the wall , The location was very good 
144748,The Queens Gate Hotel, Carpets in hall ways are basic no cushioning underfoot and therefore noisy as people move along corridors Would prefer carpets rather than vinyl floor covering in the bedroom to feel cosier , Fantastic location for Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park Really friendly staff at reception Room was a good size 
144749,The Queens Gate Hotel, We couldn t afford breakfast which seemed way too expensive at 16 per head However we found a really good sit down bakery just down the road which gave plenty of variety at very reasonable prices and with good quick service , So near to places worth visiting Staff were friendly and helpful and dealt with any hiccoughs straight away We were helpfully provided with 2 adjoining twin rooms as we could not have the family room we had booked at no extra charge This proved to be very convenient even though the parents would have liked a double bed 
144750,The Queens Gate Hotel, Room no better than a Travel Lodge Public areas quite run downand scruffy looking , Very near to Royal Albert Hall Comfortable bed Friendly helpful staff

144753,The Queens Gate Hotel, Check out waited 20 minutes to check out whilst they allowed other parties to check in at 11 30am Also unable to split a bill which seems ridiculous in this day of modern technology , Great location comfortable rooms nice cocktail menu 
144754,The Queens Gate Hotel, No bath but decent shower I would have liked breakfast included in the tariff The room was on the small side , It was exactly where I wanted to be near the V A and the Royal Albert Hall and not too far to walk from the tube The staff were friendly but not intrusive It was a lot quieter than I thought it would be as it is pretty central Very clean Television in good working order Comfortable bed 
144755,The Queens Gate Hotel, The room was clean but a little shabby in places The tiles around the bath shower could do with a good clean, Staff were warm efficient and friendly location to the Royal Albert Hall brilliant 
144756,The Queens Gate Hotel, No parking available although this is noted on site and is most likely to be expected by location I would recommend catching train tube and perhaps parking outside central London Breakfast although decent was a little pricey at 16 per person , Fantastic location and lovely room Room was fairly spacious for London and for the money Breakfast fairly decent quality Good coffee machine 
144757,The Queens Gate Hotel, The wifi did not work on the room Decor a little tired, Good location in a pleasant street and handy for transport links Great large sunny room and very clean Beds high quality and very comfortable room very secure and room facilities had a safe fridge iron hair dryer etc Excellent staff and nothing to much trouble the selection at breakfast excellent

144760,The Queens Gate Hotel, Lighting in the bathroom could have been brighter a small point but essential , The staff were helpful and courteous the hotel is very convenient for our purposes and above all we were in the company of friends who also appreciated the hotel 
144761,The Queens Gate Hotel, Only flaw was that there was no doorman to help us with bags for our 5 30am departure , Staff were helpful and accomodating friendly and personable We had a twin club room which was spacious Location is fabulous 
144762,The Queens Gate Hotel,No Negative, Location location location Love the Kensington Chelsea area closeness to Hyde Park little restaurants nearby And not that far from main attractions either by bus or tube or even walking if weather allows

144765,The Queens Gate Hotel, Room 103 had mechanical sound every 12 minutes which was very annoying , Location is great next to museums and very close to Harrods Albert Hall and Hyde Park
144766,The Queens Gate Hotel, Initial room allocation should have been better sized as a twin room It appeared like a single room being used as a twin , Beds comfy All food consumed in hotel was first class Staff very helpful and attentive Reception staff helped with query regarding disappointingly small room and changed this for us New room was very nice Facilities of the hotel good Nice little gym Lovely quiet area within walking distance to tube and city sights Easy local bus routes at end of road 
144767,The Queens Gate Hotel, Nothing like the luxurious photos on the website Dustwebs hanging from the lights in the room Tatty fake wood flooring Old blood stains on quilt , restaurant food excellent although choice limited Bar restaurant staff very helpful and friendly Breakfast good with variety of food on offer 
144768,The Queens Gate Hotel, Unfortunatley very slow service when ordering a bar meal And of course a room close to the lift , The staff could not do enough to make you welcome in this establishment Their politeness was lovely and most refreshing in this day and age 
144769,The Queens Gate Hotel, Breakfast cheaper and nicer at local cafes , Great location for museums easy walking distance and also lots of lovely cafes for breakfast nearby Lovely Kensington Gardens also very nearby 
144770,The Queens Gate Hotel, It s looking tired the heating wasn t working very well panels from the door close mechanism are missing in the ladies the electrical PAT test certificate stickers had a mix of dates and the ones I looked it stated they were over due The service in the bar was very slow The cleaning standards have slipped We have been visiting for the past 6 years but don t plan to return , Great location
144771,The Queens Gate Hotel, Breakfast was a bit disappointing Lovely fresh orange juice Completely self service would be nice if tea and coffee were served to the table Found the bacon a bit over cooked but it could have been sat for a while , Nice hotel ideal for the Royal Albert Hall 
144772,The Queens Gate Hotel, I have always maintained that breakfast should be included in the price but that is just me otherwise there is no fault that I can think of Well done Queens Gate , The bed was very comfortable and the hotel was very handy if we wanted to go to the royal Albert Hall and the staff were very friendly and helpful 
144773,The Queens Gate Hotel, From the description and price of the room me and my girlfriend stayed in I was expecting a much bigger room than we received , The bed was extremely comfortable and was fairly large which was nice to spread out and have a good nights sleep 
144774,The Queens Gate Hotel, The decor on the stairs up to our triple room were looking a bit worn but that s being really picky , Staff were really friendly helpful and professional Our iron wasn t working and they replaced it within minutes Location is great entrance and lounge stylish and really lovely Room was excellent we had a triple room with three single beds Good beds very comfy and relaxing All in all an excellent stay Would definitely return 
144775,The Queens Gate Hotel, Inefficiently soundproof they did not refill the amenities only one bathtowel bad wi fi the Hotel needs some renovation, Good location nice neighbourhood comfortable bed worth the money
144776,The Queens Gate Hotel, Bathroom was somewhat outdated Bedroom would benefit from a lick of paint , Its the perfect location for the Royal Albert Hall which is the reason for our visit The price per night is inflated due to being in South Kensington Rooms are average size with very small bathrooms The reception and bar look to be recently refurbed whereas the rooms ad certainly the bathrooms need a certain touch up We booked in advance at 150 per night not including breakfast which was 16 per person I did check the prices on the journey down and they were offering deals of 129 per night including breakfast for two 
144777,The Queens Gate Hotel, The seating in the bar was very stained which was a shame as the overall look of the hotel was very modern The bar food was tasty and well priced but we thought the drinks were expensive in comparison , Staff very helpful good choice at breakfast room small but had everything we needed and more 
144778,The Queens Gate Hotel, Extremely poor wifi connectivity It was frustrating and lasted throughout my stay It was better late at night but was pretty much unavailable during daytime , Very nice staff The location is great with underground nearby 
144779,The Queens Gate Hotel, The noise level from the other rooms went on till past 3am in the morning The radiator did not turn off so had to have the window open which then made it quite noisy from road traffic The room was very small and the shower so tiny it was just possible to wash the room was a bit shabby and in need of a refresh , All staff in all areas that I came into contact with were exceptional in particular Marta on reception Location was good for the Albert Hall Breakfast was very good the quality of the food on offer was much better than expected 
144780,The Queens Gate Hotel, We had room 510 too small and too hot Stayed in much nicer rooms there so very disappointed , The hotel is lovely clean and bright Breakfast was really good lots of choice 
144781,The Queens Gate Hotel, Fitness suite was advertised as being available until 11pm but was locked by 8pm, Excellent location for Hyde Park and Kensington Park Gardens Natural History Museum etc

144783,The Queens Gate Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and were always happy to help you As soon as we turned up at the hotel the porter took our suitcases into the hotel for us and to our rooms They arranged for taxi s for us The breakfast was lovely with different choices of food to choose from Will be coming back to this hotel as the staff are so friendly and the hotel was spotless 
144784,The Queens Gate Hotel, Room was on the 5th floor and quite hot when we got there cooled it down OK by opening the window had to put the aircon on in the evening but that did the trick No free bottled water , Very comfortable bed and pillows Small but well equipped bathroom Tea and coffee making facilities Quiet room at the back of the hotel Good choice of food at breakfast 
144785,The Queens Gate Hotel, Tap in bathroom sink took ages to run warm Shower base needed better attention to cleaning , The breakfast was excellent everything you could possibly want Excellent location we went to the Royal Albert Hall on the Saturday so it was just a few minutes walk Staff were very friendly and helpful 
144786,The Queens Gate Hotel, Our room 215 was barely a double with only a small gap between the end of the bed and the wall which meant walking sideways beween the bed and a wall with a flat screen tv mounted on it The paintwork was scuffed and generally tired The bathroom was small and the shower was uncomfortably small I found it difficult to turn around , Great public areas and the staff were friendly
144787,The Queens Gate Hotel, Our room was much too hot and despite setting the thermostat to 18C and turning on the fan we couldn t get it to cool down The nice young man on the front desk came to our and quickly sorted things out starting by shutting off the radiator Breakfast was rather uninspiring The buffet included churros and Spanish tortilla neither of which I ve encountered before in UK hotels but no fried eggs The cocktails in the bar were very expensive and not very good , Our room was large We were at the back on the fifth floor and could no traffic noise at all The shower was a good size and I liked having the sort of shower head you can unhook from the wall as opposed to the fixed rainfall type The staff were extremely helpful 
144788,The Queens Gate Hotel, We didn t have breakfast We had to leave at 7 00 am and breakfast wasn t served until 7 00 am so it really wasn t an option for us , Welcoming staff Clean comfortable and spacious room The ensuite facilities were complete with the options of bath and shower Everything was ready for our arrival printed out receipt etc Name recognised Good attention to these details 
144789,The Queens Gate Hotel, The bar Very cold stuck right at front door Staff were not very friendly on reception , The location The bedroom was fine but our first bedroom reeked of sewerage and we were moved Not what we were expecting for a hotel in Kensington 
144790,The Queens Gate Hotel, I can t say as for us there was nothing that could be done any better, Really close to tube Nice location This was my second stay so the Hotel still impressed again 
144791,The Queens Gate Hotel, The room was very small it was difficult to walk from one end of the room to the other because there is no room between the end of the bed and the table The cord on the kettle was so short you could not plug it in The electric socket behind the beside table was hanging off the wall The shower was very powerful but the space in the cubicle was non existent And although it was my daughters birthday they did not even wish her happy birthday which is in contrast to the time we stayed in the Cumberland Hotel in Marble Arch for my Son s 8th Birthday where they not only wished him happy birthday but they sent him a platter of fresh fruit with a note wishing him happy birthday All in all a very disappointing experience , I liked the location it was close to the Albert Hall where we were seeing a show 
144792,The Queens Gate Hotel, Area is too quiet with nothing much to do and shops , Nice thick and fluffy bath towels Nearby to hyde park and about 10mins walk to underground station
144793,The Queens Gate Hotel, Staff could have been friendlier It s basic on amenities but that s all we were looking for , Excellent location for natural history museum royal Albert Hall restaurants and tube Unbeatable value for money if you want a clean comfortable modern room in centre of London 
144794,The Queens Gate Hotel, Room quite small and a bit tired looking shower hose has seen better days Breakfast was not included Room wasn t ready before 2 00 we arrived at 1 45 so left our bags and went off for the afternoon , Excellent location for the Royal Albert hall We had a quiet room at the back of the hotel on fourth floor 
144795,The Queens Gate Hotel, The room was right by the lift and there was no carpet outside the lift so you could hear footsteps people outside the door at night and early in the morning , King size bed large fluffy towels subtle modern decor tea and coffee facilities not a bad size room for London Location was perfect for many of the sites we wanted to visit Also great local cafes for breakfast 
144796,The Queens Gate Hotel, Nothing, The reception staff where helpful and friendly the room was clean and well equipped ie coffee tea mini bar bar hair dryer ironing board even scales beds comfortable and breakfast was great lots of choice will stay here again

144798,The Queens Gate Hotel, Very small gap between bottom of bed and table Room 311 Had to walk sideways to get through , Location to Royal Albert Hall Kensington High Streeet close by 
144799,The Queens Gate Hotel, The room was quite small It was fine for one night but would have been a bit cramped for a longer stay Fortunately the high ceilings stopped it feeling too claustrophobic , The hotel is in a good location in Kensington just down the road from Benny Hill s old house Our room was at the front overlooking the street 
144800,The Queens Gate Hotel, The Wi Fi was very weak in the 5th floor rooms , Pleasant welcoming staff comfortable clean well appointed rooms excellent facilities very good location plentiful good breakfast
144801,The Queens Gate Hotel, The room was small had to lean past the TV on the wall and walk sideways at the bottom of the bed No bath which would have been nice after a long day walking , The location was excellent for museums and Albert Hall
144802,The Queens Gate Hotel, A tiny bit too far from the underground station to be really convenient , Location next to the museums Nice modern continental quality bathroom Reasonably friendly staff 
144803,The Queens Gate Hotel, The bar area could be more inviting It s small and due to modern design is colder than cozy , This hotel has a lovely modern design We needed a room for 2 adults and 2 children and loved that the kids had their own single beds Our room was on 1 and at first we were worried about being on a lower level but the room was extremely spacious shockingly so did have a large window so we didn t feel jailed in and had generous lighting through the room and by bed sides Location was fantastic Quick walk to Gloucester Road tube station or South Kensington And Museum of Natural History is just a 2 minute walk down the road The staff was friendly and helpful 
144804,The Queens Gate Hotel, Very badly designed shower which flooded the bathroom when the plug seemed bunged up Not always the best of TV receptions A bit short on space, Close proximity to the museums Safe feeling area at night Relatively quiet even though there was a wide road outside Comfortable bed
144805,The Queens Gate Hotel, When we got home we discovered that our bank account had debited twice and upon calling the hotel they completely denied this It took a visit to my bank to sort it out, Room was clean and bed was excellent
144806,The Queens Gate Hotel, Limited bar menu several items of which were not available but very reasonably priced for Kensington Food quality was fair not memorable, Superb powerful shower Largest most comfortable bed ever Extensive choice for buffet breakfast Felt very swish throughout the hotel Very handy for Natural History Museum Royal Albert Hall
144807,The Queens Gate Hotel, Rooms a bit tight and wardrobe very small not suitable for more than a short stay, Well situated in Kensington for tube and museums Small but comfortable rooms well equipped and clean Staff helpful and responsive
144808,The Queens Gate Hotel, Nothing , Beautiful full length Windows Staff go the extra mile all staff Very clean and well presented hotel Beautiful furnishing Very lavish Would stay again for definite 
144809,The Queens Gate Hotel, Room s furnishings poor beds very uncomfortable noise isolation poor the entire night we could hear the tossing and turning of the guests above us , The receptions attitude regarding type of card payment was sarcastic borderline offensive Otherwise they were polite and prompt on ordering the taxi 
144810,The Queens Gate Hotel, No where to put washbags in bathroom Hairdrier in bathroom got very wet from steam as no decent extractor fan Hairdrier should be in bedroom , Good shower and decent sized towels 
144811,The Queens Gate Hotel, We had lunch at the hotel but the service was slow and the soup awful How could soup be that bad One was a water consistency and the other milk It put us off so much that we decided to go to breakfast The hotel appeared short staffed too at reception for example, Room was a good size clean and well furnished for a London hotel at that price Staff were friendly and helpful 
144812,The Queens Gate Hotel, Noise from the floor above sounded like they have opened an elephant sanctuary up there I m sure this was just a case of bad timing and being below some loud heavy footed guests but overall a great hotel , Great location friendly staff
144813,The Queens Gate Hotel, Our room was unbearably hot room 411 even though the heating was not on The aircon was no good We had the window open the whole time but it was still too hot We did not sleep with any covers on end of January Road noise was suffered due to having the window open, Great location for Albert Hall Natural History Museum and V A museum
144814,The Queens Gate Hotel, Broken bed leg told it would be ok till next day despite being very unstable we had to insist we were given a different room the next room was on the front of the hotel and was very small lots of road noise hotel certainly not worth 135 per night Would not recommend it and we will not be staying here again, Location to albert hall

144818,The Queens Gate Hotel, Just the room size it was impossible to get the cases around the bottom of the bed to where the storage space was , Perfect location Clean modern with generally friendly always helpful staff 
144819,The Queens Gate Hotel, London prices , Comfortable room good sized bed and all very clean Staff were helpful and welcoming Location was spot on for the Albert Hall Kensington museums and Hyde Park 
144820,The Queens Gate Hotel, our room was a little tired with scuffed paintwork in many places and quite noisy from room above and below , location as we were at events at Royal Albert Hall and V A 
144821,The Queens Gate Hotel,No Negative, the hotel has obviously been re furbished recently and is very well done the staff were all lovely and very helpful the breakfast in the specifically designed breakfast room was amazing with something for everyone and plenty of it extremely good value for money we all had a very enjoyable stay 
144822,The Queens Gate Hotel, Booked a double and a twin room each cost 120 Very disappointed with the double room room and bathroom were about half the size of the twin room If the double room is normally smaller then it should be cheaper , The location was perfect for the Royal Albert Hall Nice bar area
144823,The Queens Gate Hotel, The wardrobe in my bedroom had an iron stored in the hanging space The fixed hangers were positioned very close together making it impossible to use I was only staying one night so it was not an issue for me , The Queensgate Hotel is well appointed and situated close to the local museums shops and restaurants The Reception staff were very welcoming and efficient My room was spacious clean comfortable and quiet My room had the street view I had requested 
144824,The Queens Gate Hotel, Room big but very cold Windows single glazed didn t close properly Floor slightly worn fabricated planks no carpet Bathroom not clean sink grubby and blocked Shower hose leaking badly These were addressed after complaint but the work created a leak in the sink waste that then dropped into the waste bin Not good enough for 220 quid per night ,No Positive
144825,The Queens Gate Hotel, Cooked breakfast was only luke warm as the heater did not have hot water in the lower heating chamber The staff said they never used this method which accounts for why the food was almost cold The lady in the restaurant was apologetic but clearly didn t know how to use the heater correctly Reception staff were keen to address the problem , Comfortable bed soft matress very good Small but adequate room Bathroom clean but usual grubby dirt around shower cubicle door rails as found in most hotels I would use the hotel again
144826,The Queens Gate Hotel, The bathroom and bedroom was on the small side Shower in bathroom with screen not very good mouldy spots Could be so much better with a bit of TLC , The Location is superb
144827,The Queens Gate Hotel, 1 Kettle cord is far too short about 7in or 18cm I ve to move it from fridge top to desk top put writing pad hotel book under it so that it can reach the socket The kettle nearly touched the wall because the cord is so short When I removed it from the socket I burt my lower hand 2 The bed is huge leave very little room to move around it to draw the curtain The bed can be smaller to give more space to walk around , Location is excellent the bed is very comfy 
144828,The Queens Gate Hotel, 1 The cleaning of the room was horrible always dirty glasses and the minibar not refilled even when u ask them 3 times 2 Rooms are small and old not corresponding to photos I would give the hotel not more than 3 3 We had two rooms booked had a family trip both through booking from the beginning we mentioned to the hotel stuff that probably we ll leave earlier they told that it is not a problem some people were leaving earlier others stayed for another few days but not till the end of the booking there was no problem with one room but with another room they told that they cant do that until we contact booking com and tell them that we are leaving 24h in advance novody mentioned that to us when we said that we are leaving and it was more than 24h the fact that the other room had no problems they told it was a mistake a stupid russian lady on the reception could only say i can t help u for the moment i have no information anyway we had to stay for another day because of that there , The location is pretty good
144829,The Queens Gate Hotel, The bathroom was very small and the gym facilities were not really adequate , The beds were really comfortable The room was clean and the property was in a great location 
144830,The Queens Gate Hotel, The bed was too hard but when I mentioned this on checkout the receptionist assured me that next time I only had to request bed toppers My supper steak was inedible , The staff were very bright cheerful and helpful The room clean and cheerful 
144831,The Queens Gate Hotel, Everything except the staff at hotel which was a shame Check in lady was very abrupt barman in the evening was much the same Such a shame for a nice hotel , Location was excellent for us as we were going to The Royal Albert hall so just a short walk for us ladies in the evening Lovely area and did not have the madness of central London
144832,The Queens Gate Hotel, The hotel is old the rooms are congested the windows are locked this makes you feel like your in a prison You hear all the noises from the corridor My room was exactly in front of the lift you can imagine i heard every footstep every conversation between people right from 6 30 am all the way till 7pm It was a depressing experience The decor is completely sad something like a Dracula movie The window kept banging because of the wind i don t mind noises but this was just terrible I couldn t sleep more than 4 hours I checked in thinking i would stay for 4 days i left the very next day There are much better hotels than this one for the same or less price I do not recommend this hotel unless you get a bigger room away from the elevator maybe , The location is really nice in Belgravia the square with coffee shops and ice skating ring is like 10 min walk The staff was kind 
144833,The Queens Gate Hotel, The staff were fine or arrival but by no means the friendliest There is no restaurant only a bar The bar is fit for purpose but rather small and the TV was on the whole time Not a great atmosphere Cocktails over priced for the quality During our stay start of Christmas season there was a big leak in the ceiling of the bar no mention of it nor apology We ate in the hotel which is ok for a snack look elsewhere if you want really decent meal , Loved the location and bedrooms above average standard Great for a short stay But not a 4 star hotel in our opinion 
144834,The Queens Gate Hotel, Rooms are small But for this price it was exceptional Wifi is very poor And very slow Small clothets But for someone who doesnt travel with two big suit cases it s ok , The location is excellent 5 min walk from Hyde park The hotel is modern Nice breakfast Very nice bar And a restaurant For 4 stars butique hotel the price is more then reasonable Clean facilities Friendly stuff A manager came to us almost every day asking how we were doing and if we needed anything extra to get So it s defiantly recommended to stay there 
144835,The Queens Gate Hotel, To get to the room you needed to access another locked door to 2 rooms and entering here the smell was a bit unpleasant , Quiet room as requested Room 508 Very comfortable bed and pillows Good view 
144836,The Queens Gate Hotel, Stayed in a triple single room which turned out to be in the basement with one window looking into a light well Wish we had known before booking , Great location close to shopping park restaurants and museums Comfortable beds Modern clean line decor Reasonable price for location 
144837,The Queens Gate Hotel, Breakfast at 16 per head seems overpriced I felt obliged to have a cooked breakfast as well as cereal to get some value My wife is vegetarian so didn t have that option ,No Positive
144838,The Queens Gate Hotel, The d cor was a bit glitzy very bright tiles etc I did not like the fake grey wood floorboards in the bedroom It felt more three star then four , Very good location and not a bad price for central London Pleasant staff 
144839,The Queens Gate Hotel, Could have booked cheaper rate on another site Club room we booked was basically all bed and tiny bathroom Is 304 really club standard , Location to Albert Hall
144840,The Queens Gate Hotel, Just a little oversite on housekeeping The bin from the previous guests had not been emptied nor the door wiped down some make up fingerprints or the floor hoovered Mainly just a bathroom issue Which was sorted the next day , Location was ideal close to everywhere we needed to go Staff were so polite and helpful The hotellier who greeted us was so friendly The hotel itself is lovely and modern Would definitely reccommend this hotel 
144841,The Queens Gate Hotel, Noisy plumbing from surrounding rooms Cleaner was not aware room was occupied and came to clean and entered room at 8 30 when we hadn t checked out yet and were actually still sleeping , Excellent location Price lower than other similar hotels in area Good breakfast selection Staff is friendly and smiling 
144842,The Queens Gate Hotel, A little bit off the beaten track and a cold somewhat uninviting lobby Not a place to hang out which we would have liked traveling with friends , The room was really spacious and nicely decorated
