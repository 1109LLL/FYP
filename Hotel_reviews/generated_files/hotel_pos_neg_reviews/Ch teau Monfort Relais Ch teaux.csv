303186,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Nothing our stay was perfect , Beautiful hotel with incredible attention to detail We only stayed for one night and genuinely wish that we were staying for longer The spa is amazing and definitely worth a visit and the breakfast was lovely and fresh 
303187,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, WiFi was horribly slow one of the worst internet i ve ever seen Rooms are very small but nicely done , Location is good walking distance from Via Montenapoleone Hotel is pretty spa is nice 
303188,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Wouldn t change a thing and will return , The room was gorgeous The bathroom lovely The reception was warm and helpful We arrived late and the recommendation for a late night restaurant was truly amazing 
303189,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Nothing , Staff could not have done more for us They were friendly helpful and interested in our stay Breakfast had everything you could have thought of Everything was absolutely 5 Everyday you came back to sweets in your room and a weather forecast for the next day Plus we were upgraded on arrival Could not have had a better stay in Milan 
303190,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Nothing, Huge room high ceilings overlooking the courtyard in a beautiful older building The bathroom was nice luxurious with a comfortable bath and shower Staff was extremely friendly and always helpful In a great area away from all the tourist traps but surrounded by lots of restuarants cafes and shops About an 8 10 minute walk from the Metro with a tram stations just out front Complimentary water bottles everyday chocolates and chips Highly recommend and definitely worth a visit 
303191,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Very expensive drinks at the hotel but so were a lot of the bars around certain tourist attractions Best deals are in the parks for drinks and ice creams , Excellent Hotel clean and beautiful decor Very helpful and polite staff Did not use the spa as too busy exploring but it looks wonderful Great location to explore the city 
303192,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Only a very small observation that there was no bath But the shower was very nice , Exceptional staff Everyone was polite friendly and very helpful We were about 0 5 mile s walk from the shopping centre and 1 mile from the Duomo The breakfast was excellent with lots of choice to suit all palates As a lovely gesture they gave our daughter a little birthday cake treat We would come again 
303193,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Gym was quite small, The room was beautifully decorated and the bed was comfortable great breakfast The sauna and pool area was very relaxing Friendly staff 
303194,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, The price of drinks in the lobby bar I really wanted to enjoy the wonderful bar but drinks where extortionately priced even for a classy hotel such as this one I expect to pay more but not double and triple the price I would pay anywhere else , Loved the room decor and the comfort of the whole place 
303195,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Only two seats at the reception area There are 2 lifts and one of them was out of order for whole duration of our stay 4 days Reception staff look like not happy to see you Poor breakfast buffet not as expected from a 5 star hotel Ceiling decoration within the room was peeled off Strange room arrangement Bathroom is separated by glass walls from the rest of the room There is a curtain for privacy but they forget to provide curtain between shower and the entrance door So if someone opens the door they are able to see inside shower There was strange sound comes periodically from AC unit Pillows are too thin even if you used two There is only one bottle of water 500 ml as complementary for two Cleaning was ok ,No Positive
303196,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Location s entourage isnt the greatest works in progress and does not match the photos Closest Metro station is San Babila so expect some walking to do or ride the bus Some of the staff members are not worth being front desk assistants while others exceeded the expectations and provided great level of services Its unfortunate for a 5 stars hotel and would impact the journey of customers having a long stay What I hated the most is blocking my credit card with the full amount of money preauthorization though it was booked as prepayment only pay at thr property directly however on last day after checking out the receptionist stated that the amount needs around 2 weeks to be refunded to my credit card This is very unfortunate specially when I paid the full invoice by cash so the blocked amount should have been immediately like other Booking com hotel previously did with me OR they should have released faster than that Blocking such a huge amount on a customer s credit card for 2 weeks isnt very convenient , The beds are very comfortable The rain shower is very nice with a good pressure The room size is good compared to Italy s other hotels Breakfast contains a lot of options and is very well displayed The pure honey is simply oustanding as well as the cappucino 
303197,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, The room was small with limited storage space for 2 persons luggage food and drink in the hotel is very expensive and not great value much better value to be had in the surrounding cafes and restaurants which cater for every taste and price range , Staff where extremely friendly and helpful very grand public areas which where spotlessly clean Our room was also very clean and tidy with air con and a very comfortable bed room was serviced every day Great access to the spa area which was complementary treatments are not complementary We didn t eat in the hotel simply because of price 
303198,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, The room was on a low floor Which was disappointing The pool spa was extra 30E which was way out of our range The Australian exchange rate is very poor so that makes it doubly too expensive, Beds were comfortable Nice and clean Good breakfast
303199,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Some building works adjacent to the hotel but not causing disruption or noise, Beautiful hotel with excellent staff Just a short walk from the city centre bars cafe s and attractions Also there is a tram stop opposite the hotel and a Metro station nearby There is actually quite a bit to see and do in Milan besides the designer fashion outlets Great food don t forget to visit Luini s famous Panzerotti shop Also if you tire of Italian food there is the Chinese quarter nearby 
303200,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux,No Negative, We had an excellent stay Staff was extremely friendly and helpful They even provided light snacks and water upon departure We will definitely stay there again and recommend it to everybody 
303201,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, The price of the room versus the quality what you must have in a five star hotel Although our stay in Milano was nice and the staff is very friendly the room was outdated and noicy , Very friendly and helpful staff good breakfast and sweet hotel 
303202,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Nothing Everything was perfect, Proper 5 star service from the staff From the moment we arrived till the moment we left they took care of everything Nothing was too much trouble They went above and beyond the call of Duty to make us as comfortable as possible Easily the best hotel experience I have ever had And the breakfast was outstanding A surprise bottle of bubbles on account of our recent engagement I can t recommend this hotel enough 
303203,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux,No Negative, Fantastic staff and an amazing breakfast Very good location to explore Milan The bedrooms are very romantic Will definitely book this hotel again 
303204,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, I think value for money in the bar was a little bit low That s the only improvement I can come up with , The most impressive with Chateau Montfort was the staff We felt so welcome and they were always helpful and positive It felt like they did their very best to make you happy and enjoy your stay Then the rooms and the breakfast was also perfect 
303205,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, The decoration is sometimes quite kitsch But this is in line with the hotel s main theme , The staff was extremely friendly The spa was modern You can receive a WIFI transponder for free when you visit Milan which is a nice plus The reception helped us with restaurants and reservations Great breakfast buffet 
303206,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, It would have been great to have had a place to sit in the sun A roof terrace would have been ideal , The room and facilities were excellent The selection for breakfast was superb The staff very friendly 
303207,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, The swiming pool is very small Missing a jacuzzi in the spa Some problems with the shower drain , The hotel is well located Only 15 min walking to the centre The staff are very kind friendly and helpful Clean rooms and very quiet 
303208,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux,No Negative, Beautiful hotel situated not that close to a metro but there is a tram line outside the door Staff are beyond helpful We were upgraded to a stunning room with a brilliant view Would 100 stay again Felt so welcome in the hotel Thank you
303209,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, way overpriced most expensive yet least enjoyable of all the many hotels on our trip the smallest room too old hotel inconvenient location only tram nearby no metro VERY far from train stations and airport not a lot to eat nearby that wasn t exorbitantly high or uninteresting Splurged to relax but didn t happen here either Old and foo foo hotel Not even breakfast is included Will probably never stay in a relais chateau after this experience , helpful only genuinely smiling staff member the bellboy
303210,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Staff is so annoying they treat every guest as they never stayed in hotel before They wasted a lot of time talking to us about the spa menu and mini bar also rooms are tiny there is no shower only bath and water is dripping everywhere while you shower NOT a 5 stars definitely ,No Positive
303211,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, There was an immigrant and homeless centre right next door to the hotel and they were urinating against the walls drinking beers and generally it felt threatening Our air conditioning didn t work so the room was constantly hot, The hotel was quirky and the staff were lovely shame about the location
303212,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, This is not a 5 star hotel it is a very nice luxury 4 star but needs external renovation The price charged was too high considering that similar last minute prices were available at other nearby 5 star hotels that were much better in terms of facilities, Cleanliness
303213,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux,No Negative, The staff are super friendly and helpful We bought the bus metro tickets at the reception Very cozy hotel with classic deco Clean and comfie Bus stops very nearby
303214,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Access to cooked breakfast apart from eggs was difficult and there was some sort of mens shelter next door which when walking past felt a little uncomfortable , Staff were exceptional and the hotel so quirky and fun The spa was small but perfect 
303215,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Was just a little underwhelming for a Relais Chateau Location was also just a little bit off centre It was a 20 mins walk to the Duomo which is not too bad but I felt I was booking something closer The omelette at breakfast was very oily with sun dried tomatoes than fresh cut ones and closer to a double fried egg than an omlette , The staff were terrific from the pleasant doorman to the helpful front desk team excellent bar manager The people are a credit to the hotel Room was great very comfortable and a great size Bathroom was spacious and large by European standards 
303216,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Everyone excelled to make this holiday absolutely perfect , The whole experience from the staff rooms facilities and location were impeccable This experience truly was magical and am overwhelmed with how good the Chateau Monfront Hotel was The whole facility and experience is just jaw dropping An absolute must see 
303217,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Poor level of English of the staff Hard to get myself understood Poor breakfast limited choice and the fact that the staff does not speak English soft boiled eggs come as hard as rock , excellent manager very helpful Staff smiling Clean facilities
303218,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Some of the rooms are small with a view on the inside courtyard while some of the rooms on the street are quite busy Renovation work on the square in front of the hotel still not completed , Overall nice boutique hotel well located and good value for money 
303219,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Bed isn t comfortable too stiff hurting my back Our room is in the 0 floor ground too noisy we can hear tram from ground killing our sleep quality As a 5 stars hotel I doubt , Location is good 10 minutes walking to reach Dumo Staffs are nice
303220,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, 2 things We give them the wifi modem 2 days sooner and leave the hotel and two days after my partenr in work leave the hotel and wanna check out and they get 100 for modem and tell they do not give the wifi modem it is like rubbery And indo not know why they do it and they can check videos of the registery desk and can see we give them the modem Thats very bad thing And other thing is that the showering room is with glass and we are colleage in one room and we do not have privacy These two is very bad But i do nit know why they still 100 of our money, 
303221,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux,No Negative, Felt very welcome and loved the small hotel feel personal Pool area was a treat at the end of a busy day Staff were extra helpful Would go to this hotel again 
303222,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Restaurant was limited and area right outside hotel unsightly with construction graffiti and homeless Didn t feel safe to leave hotel at night , Lovely staff and interesting decor etc
303223,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, The urge to go for 5 star perfection has dissapeared but the price has stayed the same Breakfast is still 52 for 2 persons but if you want orange juice you have to ask every morning if it s possible to refill The staff forgets for who those 2 cappuccino are and asks everybody if they are for them even if there is a full cup in front of them on the table Not one time but every morning At our previous stay in the beginning of this year there was focus service for the same 52 So the place lost his glance for us for sure when you leave on a Sunday like we did Then the crew is not at all at his best It s a pity , Still very nice rooms perfect location in the residential area of Milano within walking distance of the Duomo but something has changed with the service 
303224,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, The only two things I would change are first the lack of a window we only had skylights in our room and second the street out in front of the hotel is totally torn up and is an eyesore I am sure that the hotel management is not happy about the street either , Really nice hotel within walking distance to the Cathedral and fashion district Nicely equipped funky rooms we had toy soldiers on our bed posts 
303225,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux,No Negative, The hotel was beautiful and unique the rooms were impeccably clean and comfortable and the staff was superb I would stay here again in a heartbeat The location was walking distance to everything we wanted to see It was perfect 
303226,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, The style of the hotel is in a charming mode We loved it for our personal occasion and it was great Though it is different from a trendy place , Very cosy place great team for support and welcome and infos room was amazing breakfast was very nice not outstanding though great spa place definitely worth the visit
303227,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, There is little I can say about things we disliked in fact there are simply none Maybe the only thing that might be inconvenient for some travellers might be the distance to the city centre although it is only a 10 min walk to the Dom , This is truly a wonderful hotel We had a short but excellent stay in the hotel and our experience was great from our arrival till our departure Breakfast was great the staff is great the piano bar was cosy the hotel has a great fairy tale theme a great hotel for a romantic getaway We will be back 
303228,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, The rooms do not have enough space to accommodate your things, Good location The hotel has an excellent restaurant Free wifi and router to use in the city Rooms are clean and nice Comfortable bed 
303229,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Right next to the property there was a facility that people lineup for either shelter or something at sunset time It doesn t make us comfortable to walk by ,No Positive
303230,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Dinner menu Poor selection disappointing main course with no side dish of vegetables or potatoes Nothing Breakfast was chaotic , The staff Very good courteous and helpful 
303231,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux,No Negative, Lovely hotel and really friendly staff who made us feel very welcome and seemed genuinely interested in ensuring we enjoyed our stay Would always stay there again when in Milan 
303232,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Nothing Wish they were at every hotel I stay at , Staff were absolutely amazing from start to finish they impressed Want to say a huge thank you They went beyond all expectation 
303233,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Spa treatments were costly and would probably get greater demand if the prices were to be restructured Floor in room 103 dangerously slippery surface, Excellent customer service upon arrival and throughout stay from reception staff day night Bar Staff very attentive helpful
303234,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux,No Negative, We had a really nive stay great location went walking to Duomo easy access Really nice staff Very intimate cool 5 Star hotel Cleaning is impecable At first we had the impression the hotel was a litle bit far from the city center but in fact it is very close from quadrilatero the la moda and the Duomo 
303235,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, There was nothing that we disliked in any way , The hotel was magnificently decorated and appointed with modern features that accentuated a classic old world hotel 
303236,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Everything was perfect , The villa itself was stunning and attention to detail incredible everything from landscaping to living room and kitchen well kept All rooms were beautiful and the master bedroom something else We even loved the smell of the shampoo and body soap Loved that the car rental was included but mostly Dimitri the host was very friendly and provided the best service Anything we needed he did the utmost to make it happen and provided nice dining recommendations He picked up both of our parties one at the airport and one at the boat port and dropped us off at another port 45 mins away at the end of our stay refusing to accept a tip Sisi the cleaning lady servant was also fantastic doing an exceptional job with my laundry and serving breakfast every morning There was 6 of us in total and the vote was unanimous we would all stay here again Will definitely recommend to people staying in Zakynthos 
303237,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Spa little bit small but nice choice of breakfast limited but high quality Spa for kids only from 3pm to 5 pm, excellent location supermarket restaurants pharmacy nearby middle of centre only 15 minutes walk nice comfortable bed stayed in fourth floor big storage facility staff excellent and clean rooms
303238,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, I think we were given the disabled access room couldn t stand up in the shower as shower head was fixed so low , Clean and comfortable good location 
303239,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Spa pool could be a little bigger, The fact they took note of my fiance allergy and prepared the room And the sweeties were great in little jars everywhere 
303240,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Nothing, Gorgeous oasis of calm and playful beauty I loved everything here delightful room with thoughtful and very fine attention to detail comfort delicious breakfast feast hammam spa a wonderful pampering treat Superbly courteous staff attentive and so helpful couldn t have been more so Can recommend this boutique hotel unreservedly Thank you very much for making my short stay so enjoyable 
303241,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, asking my children in the SPA to be quiet due to some adult complains we used the SPA in children time and noises should be expected my advise to not allow adult to use the SPA during children time , staff very nice and freindly
303242,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Nada, The staff are excellent corteous and friendly Hotel is lovely and rooms spacious Beds very comfortable and the cocktail bar a great place to start the evening 
303243,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Nothing , All Staff are super helpful and friendly including the trainees They checked all the train time table for me to Lake Como and we had a wonderful time and very pleasant day trip Well done It s a very beautiful hotel in a heritage building The bar the room decoration are all very nice like a fairy tale 10 mins walk to Duomo the city center area Which I prefer to stay a bit away from the tourists crowd so the location is ideal There is a supermarket around the corner open till 9pm which is very handy Highly recommend a steakhouse near by call Muu 2 3 mins walk from the hotel It s excellent 
303244,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux,No Negative, The hotel is very luxurious without being snobby The staff is friendly and helpful and the room was beautiful The big bath and convenient location were a huge plus for me 
303245,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Had a problem with the aircon in the room but the staff responded immediately and upgraded us to a higher category room , Nice boutique hotel in a good location Great Restaraunt food 
303246,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, The sooner the City of Milan completes the road works outside the hotel the better Hotel management may well want to monitor and control the behaviour of some riffraff and taxi drivers who congregate a little too close to the main entrance , We loved the themed rooms which are so well appointed The breakfast and dinner were first class I mean first class The glorious old building is superbly maintained and so well located being only 12 minutes walk along De Montfort to the Square and central shopping areas 
303247,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, The hotel was a little bit far away from Santa Maria delle Grazie where The Last Supper is located , The staff were very friendly thoughtful and helpful they helped us secure tickets to see The Last Supper on the next day which was my birthday We also got upgraded to a Deluxe Suite for this occasion and I received a free birthday cake as well 
303248,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, The fact we couldn t stay longer, The entire experience was amazing The room the beds the bathroom the staff and the food They went out of their way to accommodate us on both of our overnight stays with them I highly recommend this hotel It is absolutely charming The lobby bar is so lovely Bar menu is great This is the place you want to stay if you are in Milan Don t miss out 
303249,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, We had no complaints whatsoever and the walking distance to the city centre of about 15 minutes suited us fine as there were plenty of super shops en route , Reception staff were so friendly and helpful always smiling Our room was delightful and comfortable as were the lounge bar and restaurant areas Nothing to fault at all and would certainly return Nice touch with the jars of sweeties 
303250,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Not ideal for a business traveler Small desk plugs not optimized for laptop etc But definitely doable , Beautiful property great staff great location 
303251,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, I stayed for the third time last stayed my AC room didn t work I called them to fix 3 times they tried but it doesn t work thank good the weather outside cool enough so I enjoyed the fresh air I hope won t happen again for my next stay good luck , I fall in love with the ambient friendly staff the property and the interior also great location feel like my second home in Milan
303252,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, I wish the toilet had a separate shower stall as it was quite difficult to negotiate the rain shower, Everything including the breakfast and the portable wifi device which you could take with you
303253,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, the construction site next to the hotel the area around did not look wealthy sorry can not find proper english word , nice hotel and extremely friendly staff

303258,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Extra cost for spa area and for some reason spa not open when we went to use it , Friendly staff excellent service and quirky Alice in wonderland theme Good food 
303259,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, The Hotel allows children to use the Spa pool as a swimming pool Having paid to use the Spa to relax which was not cheap this was not what I expected , The Rooms were excellent the food was too and the service was second to none One of the best hotels I have stayed in 
303260,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Breakfast could be better , This is a beautiful new hotel Great interior design The staff was very king and helped with all our requests Perfect location 
303261,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, We had a terrible smell from ventilation and had to change the room Old wooden floors need renovation Definitely not a tourist location , Great breakfast and wifi 
303262,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Very expensive but was to be expected Restaurant surprisingly poor , Great standards of service and cleanliness Very good location Very peaceful and well kept hotel Staff exceptionally friendly and helpful Spacious relaxing rooms and bar area 
303263,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, When i got there and searched room price whilst searching for a bigger room there the room I was staying in was being offered a lot cheaper than i was paying per night on those same days which I could not cancel and rebook which did not seem fair so feel I overpaid compared to what someone else would have paid , Pleasant staff and enjoyable experience all round 
303264,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, several requests not answered poor English expensive breakfast 26 and buffet not complete during 3 days location spa expensive 30 entrance, spa
303265,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, 1 Stupid flyer for a pancake breakfast Absurd in a French Relais Chateaux in Italy Made no sense Plus the flyer is ugly and not refined 2 The wood stand with Restaurant Open handwritten at the entrance and the electric sign of the restaurant BLINKING outside totally ruined the image of a Relais Chateaux Plus it conveys the massage the idea that there is a problem with their restaurant 3 The bar of the hotel is very cold The attendant not attentive and not willing to please ,No Positive
303266,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Would have preferred a room looking onto to the street as the back rooms are dark High pitched hum in the corridor , The individuality of the decor Great breakfast choices Comfortable bed
303267,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, We asked for twin beds for our older children who were sharing a room When we got there the bed was a double At first they said they couldn t do anything till the next day Only when I insisted they said they could give them another room They did give us another room but they said they would make up the beds while we were out for dinner When we got back they hadn t made up the beds to twins so we asked for the bedding and our children made up the beds but in the process they noticed that the mattresses were disgusting We complained to Peter on reception who was very apologetic and offered us another room but as they were unpacked we decided to leave it as long as the mattresses were changed After all this hassle the manager knocked half of the price off for the cost for that night I did not like the idea of the bath shower in the main room , Staff helpful Very helpful with some good restaurant choices Lovely decor

303270,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, With all the rooms themed and different to one another it s difficult to know what you ve booked A helpful service could be an individual photo of the room supplied on reservation , An amazing ethereal experience of a artsy boutique hotel we were blown away by the attention to detail From entering the hotel we were wowed by the decor only to be even more exhilarated to find personalised touches in our room for our honeymoon including a welcome note and cheese platter The location for central Milan was brilliant as there were countless top rated restaurants all in walking distance Breakfast itself was an experience with the most varied and luxurious items available to eat including an impressive tray of honeycomb to compliment the fresh fruit All in an Alice In Wonderland theme Surreal PS A lovely little touch from the hotel included a beautiful goodie box which was left in our car on departure which contained treats to make our journey home smoother 
303271,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, The breakfast service was a bit chaotic made difficult perhaps by the scale and shape of the dining area , We enjoyed the elegance and wit of the decor the hotel s perfect location which offered both easy pedestrian access to central Milan and a quiet setting and above all the charm hospitality and precision of the hotel staff informative and attentive to the needs of their guests 
303272,Ch teau Monfort Relais Ch teaux, Staff accidentally put suitcases in taxi when instructed to keep them in storage They corrected the problem quickly and satisfactorily, The spa was amazing Received a birthday cake unexpectedly and a note from the General Manager
