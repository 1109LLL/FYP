49399,H tel Duc De St Simon,No Negative, Great location within walking distance to Seine and many not to be missed scenic areas Quiet Private Welcoming Very helpful staff who always provided a quick response to my emails prior to our departure We would definitely return 
49400,H tel Duc De St Simon, A little more space , Excellent location Comfortable bed and pillows quiet room overlooking a garden Helpful and courteous staff Very good free wifi Very clean Even though room is small it is pleasantly decorated and had everything we needed 
49401,H tel Duc De St Simon, The only thing is that there was no shower curtain in the bathroom Idk if that s a European thing , Great location with nice French style decoration Really loved it The staff were super nice and helpful The room was clean and in a quiet neighborhood Easy access to buses and various cafes 
49402,H tel Duc De St Simon,No Negative, The genuine warmth and friendliness of the staff from the moment we arrived was a delight and much better than experienced at larger hotels We received an early check in with a lovely room overlooking the courtyard and assistance with printing tickets as well as a late light dinner one evening The breakfast in the cave each morning was perfect and a great uniquely French and intimate atmosphere The location is also great walking distance to metro stations and Musee D orsay Notre Dame and the Latin quarter Would definitely stay here again 
49403,H tel Duc De St Simon, The only thing that was a bit annoying was the shower Not exclusive to this hotel but when using the shower as a shower and not as a hand sprayer the water tends to get all over the bathroom floor requiring post shower clean up I guess shower curtains are not widely used in Europe American point of view of course , The hotel is located in close proximity to many of the top attraction which are walkable We used an Uber to visit the the Eiffel Tower and getting a car was easy and cost effective The hotel has A C which was a necessity because of the 100F temperatures during our visit Our room had access to the 2nd floor patio so that made the stay extra special Staff was friendly and knew English well enough to help us every time we had questions 
49404,H tel Duc De St Simon, This is a stretch because really quite nice Add hot cereal to breakfast menu and a salad to room service Mini spa would be cool Honestly lovely quiet place, Lovely staff Sparkling room Divine coffee and breakfast 
49405,H tel Duc De St Simon, Asked for a taxi to Gare Lyon Instead got us a lovely driver but it was 109 Euros Yikes, Bathroom beautiful Bed very comfortable temperature control excellent Charming hotel Staff very friendly and accommodating
49406,H tel Duc De St Simon, It s a little bit pricey but a beautiful hotel , Beautiful boutique hotel in a quite area of Paris on the Left bank It s an easy walk to the Seine River either to the Notre Dame area or the area near the Musee D Orsay Great and tentative staff gave us great recommendations for restaurants within walking distance Brought drinks ice and breakfast to our room for us 
49407,H tel Duc De St Simon, It would have been nice to have had a hotel restaurant Our room was very small as was the bathroom and shower a little more space would have been nice but we didn t pay for more space , Decor is great old Paris velvet wallpaper historic decorations The location was great too Left Bank close to the Seine but quiet built as a convent There s no hotel restaurant although there is a cave downstairs where breakfast and drinks were served The breakfast was good but not stellar we were tired of it after eight days 
49408,H tel Duc De St Simon, The rooms are very small but this is a common thing in central Paris where life functions in minute spaces , Great location charming Belle poque style nice breakfast charming staff 
49409,H tel Duc De St Simon, The rooms are a bit small as are the bathrooms , This is a wonderful hotel charming friendly beautifully furnished superbly located and a perfect place to stay Breakfast is served in a most delightful and well decorated room in the cellar like a grotto and just wonderful The manager Sade could not be nicer or more helpful Very comfortable bed 
49410,H tel Duc De St Simon, On a few mornings we decided to lay in and the called us to ask if we wanted the room to be cleaned waking us up , Very friendly and accommodation staff 
49411,H tel Duc De St Simon, We would have preferred a larger room but since it was just for one night we did not ask to make a change The desk staff seemed a bit indifferent but everyone else was great The bed was also very comfortable but if a couple is used to anything larger than a double bed beware , The room had been recently renovated but we found it very small The bathroom was beautiful and functioned very well We have stayed here many times over the years and loved the service at the bar breakfast area and from the porters We also love the neighborhood and felt totally at home at the hotel 
49412,H tel Duc De St Simon, My only suggestion would be a bigger breakfast variety and more available seating for parties of two in the breakfast room , Very charming breakfast room downstairs Albon and Daniel at the front desk were very helpful and accommodating The hotel is tucked away on a quiet side street but is ideally located for Metro access I would absolutely recommend booking a suite if you are staying for several days The standard rooms are cozy but very small 
49413,H tel Duc De St Simon, Rooms are small which is to be expected in Paris at this price point But the bathroom was quite roomy , The public spaces and rooms are absolutely beautiful The staff were very very helpful 
49414,H tel Duc De St Simon, Nothing Great little boutique hotel Definitely recommend , The staff were lovely and really helpful The hotel was spotlessly clean warm great to come back to and relax after a day out sightseeing 
49415,H tel Duc De St Simon, Nothing major Bed and pillows a bit uncomfortable Breakfast and sound isolation could be better However I understand that this hotel is very old and soundproofing is not possible Water in the shower splashes everywhere , It is very cosy Staff was very welcoming We had room with terrace In summer this would have been perfect Hotel has a lot of character is very old hotel Bathroom was spotless Area very close to louvre Easy to find Staff very helpful 
49416,H tel Duc De St Simon,No Negative, The hotel was beautiful and quaint and in a perfect location for restaurants shopping and transportation Within a very short walk to the Musee D Orsay which was a bonus Service was excellent 
49417,H tel Duc De St Simon, Nothing lacking, Very quiet with multi glazed windows Very powerful instant hot shower Helpful friendly staff High quality well decorated rooms Good location Lovely bar in basement area Best place I have stayed in many visits to Paris 
49418,H tel Duc De St Simon, You had to lock in to the internet again and again , Charming small room with fine details but no kettle for tee making and a nice view to the side of the hotel with threes etc 4 floor Elegant bathroom Very good location if you want to stay close to the Seine and the museums and between 6 and 7 arr and still stay in a quiet neighborhood 
49419,H tel Duc De St Simon, The room was very small The hotel is a bit cramped , Very friendly pretty hotel in a lovely part of Paris The staff were very nice and helpful Good restaurants nearby Quiet at night 
49420,H tel Duc De St Simon,No Negative, All of it Location size DECOR services airport pic up perfect menu quiet hidden street Want some history of bldg age owners etc hotel keeps getting better we have been coming for 30 years 
49421,H tel Duc De St Simon, The walls are thin We had a neighbor watch tv all night and we heard it the entire time , Charming and elegant Historical building with a beautiful interior Great location and steps away from a metro Amazing staff 
49422,H tel Duc De St Simon, It is a small property and some concessions to space but you expect so in Paris , Staff was friendly and helpful Great location in St Germain If you are good walkers you can walk to most of the main sites Local area is cool also 
49423,H tel Duc De St Simon, The room was much too small The toilet flush fell off the wall That shower was only half closed which made for a wet bathroom and the safe did not work properly , Staff were wonderful 
49424,H tel Duc De St Simon, Nothing, Beautiful decoration lovely courtyard quiet yet very convenient location easy walk to the louvre and Rivoli The lady serving breakfast is nice friendly and helpful
49425,H tel Duc De St Simon,No Negative, Great location before a drive through the mountains Very clean room and sunny views Dinner was delicious I recommend the goat cheese salad Service a bit slow but not a problem Easy and as described Good value 
49426,H tel Duc De St Simon, WIFI should have been for the 4 days Had to re login in every 24 hours Breakfast expensive for what was offered , Beds and pillows were very comfortable In walking distance to most of the highlights of Paris Plenty of cafes in the neighbourhood Nice and close to the Seine 
49427,H tel Duc De St Simon, Space between bed and the little desk is like 20 cm Difficult to squeeze in to the chair if you want to enjoy breakfast in your room, To stay in the middle of Paris but still sleep with you windows open garden view and quiet 
49428,H tel Duc De St Simon, can t think of anything, the hotel is quiet extremely comfortable the staff is extra helpful and operates expertly without hassle the downstairs areas are well furnished and quiet both inside and on the outside terrace we go there to decompress and the abiance of the St Simon is tuned to that endeavor 
49429,H tel Duc De St Simon, The hotel cannot control this but Rue de Saint Simon was under construction and difficult to navigate , Your staff remains warm and welcoming The location in the 7th is perfect for navigating the city The courtyard is always a great place to either begin or end the day 
49430,H tel Duc De St Simon, The breakfast is very overpriced compared to nearby alternatives Would appreciate coffee in the room or in the lobby as an added benefit Would suggest an update with their current chain auxiliary door lock , The room and bath were extremely well thought out and outfitted For a moderately smallish room there was an excellent amount of dresser hanging and shelf space Two women could easily apply makeup and do their hair at the same time in nicely lighted areas There were complimentary house umbrellas All of the staff was comfortable speaking English and sincerely helpful on all occasions There are English newspapers and tv stations Exceptional property other than the breakfast 
49431,H tel Duc De St Simon, We felt the the breakfast was much too expensive and would liked to have had coffee and a croissant continental breakfast included in the total price , We liked the nice sheets down pillows and comfortable blanket as opposed to duvets that are on most beds in hotels we have frequented 
49432,H tel Duc De St Simon, The size of the room could have been larger , The charm and intimacy of hotel was a plus compared to all the ultra modern hotels in Paris I loved the French decor The bathroom was new with a wonderful shower 
49433,H tel Duc De St Simon, Nothing , Completely charming cozy lovely hotel Excellent welcoming staff Room had everything Lovely bathroom Great sheets and towels Delicious breakfast Perfect location 
49434,H tel Duc De St Simon, I like crispy bacon and the bacon was too undercooked for me so I didn t get to enjoy that , I loved the window that opens to the courtyard We had a ground floor room and I liked not having to take the elevator Breakfast staff very prompt with coffee Generous amount of coffee Bread and pastries were excellent Check in was super fast and easy Our room was ready early 
49435,H tel Duc De St Simon, can t think of one downside really , very calm hotel very central location fantastic staff decoration of the room was very interesting and beautiful
49436,H tel Duc De St Simon, Don t put the nuts in your commercial and then charge for them petty Some proper knobs on the chest of drawers would be helpful Safe took too long to close Room a little too small to host 2 suitcases , Breakfast was good and the staff very helpful Good coffee and tea It s very peaceful Lovely towels and sheets The breakfast cellar is charming great decoration 
49437,H tel Duc De St Simon, No where to have a drink in the evening surprisingly as they have a stunning bar and lounge area downstairs, A stunning traditional French hotel Cosy great central location within walking distance to the main visitor attractions Good breakfast and very comfortable rooms
49438,H tel Duc De St Simon, What has really disappointed me is the breakfast It s very poor Moreover products are mainly industrial and still under plastic From a 4 hotel I would expect a larger choice and above all that almost all proposed products are local and fresh There wasn t also any low fat or light product No full wheat bread What a deception , The hotel has clearly been recently renewed always keeping an old fashion look I have also noticed the deep cleanness of its spaces both public and private Those are definitely positive points 
49439,H tel Duc De St Simon, Rooms small but expected that However noises from room next door was downside of that perhaps , Location great for what we wanted to see in Paris this time Loved old fashioned look but with mod cons Very little street noise inside Because hotel small staff knew who you were Always friendly and helpful 
49440,H tel Duc De St Simon,No Negative, From our very first stay 3 years ago to our most recent stay we were met with the most welcoming and courteous staff We look forward to our next visit Many thanks 
49441,H tel Duc De St Simon, A couple of times the air conditioning wasn t working when we returned in the evening All it took was a call to the front desk to bring it back on I couldn t get a clear answer about why this happened , Great location close to Metro quiet many nearby moderately priced restaurants Lovely breakfast buffet Nice little garden patio inside the front gates 
49442,H tel Duc De St Simon, The rooms we booked were rather small We will go with Superior accommodations next time , Quiet street cozy accommodations helpful staff excellent breakfasts 
49443,H tel Duc De St Simon, I had no dislikes to report and would stay here the next time I am in Paris, My wife and I loved staying at this hotel Everything about it including the personnel our room and the fantastic staff made our visit to Paris all the better Clementine the property manager and concierge treated us as if we were part of her family and made our visit unique and extremely enjoyable
