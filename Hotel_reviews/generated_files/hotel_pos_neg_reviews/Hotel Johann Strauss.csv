323105,Hotel Johann Strauss, The poor breakfast They only put blue cheese not of best quality at all for one day and never again Very old furniture not clean, The friendly nice receptionists
323106,Hotel Johann Strauss, The breakfast was poor and so the breakfast area The bathroom was not clean there was always shaved hair at the counter on all 4 days that we were there Very old furniture and bed pillows and covers, I loved the helpfully friendly staff at the reception
323107,Hotel Johann Strauss,No Negative, The location to the old city and train station worked well for us There was also many places to eat within a few blocks They had a great breakfast to start our day 
323108,Hotel Johann Strauss, I would like home made brewed coffee Otherwise breakfast is good, Beds were really good Slept like a log Airy room Love air condition needed in the heat Underground outside still quite 10 min walk to Karl Platz
323109,Hotel Johann Strauss, It was one of the hottest days in the summer and we arrived after midnight all the shops around us were closed The room had a bottle of water but it cost 4 EUR It would have been great to have a complementary bottle of water instead given the circumstances , Excellent breakfast buffet 
323110,Hotel Johann Strauss, Unique issue was slow intermittent WiFi, Wondeful location with subway 50 meter away Within 15 minutes walking it s possible to reach city center and or many attraction
323111,Hotel Johann Strauss, Unfortunately some of the personnel does not speak good English while my German skills also desire improvement But we still managed , Breakfast was very pleasant and the variety of well cooked food was very good The atmosphere in the restaurant with good classical music being played just added up positively to the productive beginning of the working week 
323112,Hotel Johann Strauss, We had to ask for a room change because the first room was small and dark and it was unpleasant to stay there for 5 days Luckily the receptionist was very kind to help us so we moved to another floor to a very bright and comfortable room , The hotel was located within a few meters distance from the metro station It is very convenient to reach different locations of the city The room was very clean and the staff very helpful The wi fi was fast The Art Nouveau style of the building adds to its charm 
323113,Hotel Johann Strauss,No Negative, What a great find From the moment we arrived we could tell we were going to enjoy our stay The receptionists were so friendly and helpful and throughout our stay they recommend restaurants booked reservations at restaurants suggested places to visit and gave gems of information to ensure we made the most of our time in Vienna They also went out their way to accommodate me with gluten free bread for breakfast freshly cooked bread rolls delicious All the staff throughout the hotel were incredibly friendly helpful and professional 
323114,Hotel Johann Strauss, Breakfast was a little disappointing but Im probably being a little picky There was plenty of choice but it felt like if you werent down before 8 30am some things would run out and not be replenished The breakfast room and atmosphere made up for it , The hotel itself was lovely and unique The rooms were good quiet at night and the shower powerful The hotel was nice and warm throughout and the staff were extremely polite friendly cheerful and helpful I would definitely stay there again 
323115,Hotel Johann Strauss, Lays at the Favorietenstra e so at night some traffic noise can be heard Not a real problem for me since I was on the 4th floor at the lower floors it can become a problem , Great breakfast nice big rooms good personal inhouse parking place 
323116,Hotel Johann Strauss, The only thing that I really did not like was the price of the hotel parking garage 20 something per day which for instance means 4 days if you are staying 3 nights Paying 85 for a parking space for 3 night stay is just too much Other than that I would recommend this place , Overall it was good A bit older hotel but everything clean and nice Good breakfast and the location was incredible 2 U Bahn stations to Stephansplatz and the station is in front of the hotel 
323117,Hotel Johann Strauss, Toilet paper thick A bit farway dowtown for me over 64 if don t use underground , Breakfast excellent and staff reception really fuil of good will very friendly 
323118,Hotel Johann Strauss, The room was a little bit bare especially in the sitting room and came across as a little dreary The Double bed was just two singles pushed together that slid on the floor so easily that we woke up with the beds separated simply from rolling over in sleep , The location was very convenient to the Hauptbahnhof and not far from the city centre in the other direction The staff were friendly and efficient and the breakfast was lovely with a good selection of both hot and cold options The size of the room was wonderful with a separate sitting area and two toilets 
323119,Hotel Johann Strauss, The beds were two twins pushed together which was uncomfortable for my wife and I The rooms and furniture seemed like they were antiques which isn t necessarily a bad thing but just not to my particular taste I always feel as though I should be very careful with antique looking furniture and it s always more stiff than more contemporary furnishings , Hotel location and wifi were great It s right off the subway which was easy to access and use 
323120,Hotel Johann Strauss,No Negative, The hotel is located about 100 meteres from the nearest metro stop This stop is one stop from Vienna main station Two stops from Stephens platz Around the hotel are a few bars and resteraunts and a couple of supermarkets Excellent if you prefer somewhere quieter to eat in the evening 
323121,Hotel Johann Strauss, First night we got room without heating and after our compliant we got small noisy calorifier which wasn t able to reach normal temperature Day after we got different room where heating was better but again not so good enough so after complaint we again get same calorifier Staff wasn t so much interested and never asked me is it everything okay or am I satisfied I never got response for late check out which I asked for as a genius customer , Breakfast is excellent and location which is 20 meter from metro station is also excellent Cleanliness is good towel changing is every second day WiFi is good Value for money is acceptable 
323122,Hotel Johann Strauss, No electric kettle, Ideal location next to metro station 500 meters to the Karlsplatz Excellent breakfast A feel of late XIX century Vienna but all facilities look recently renovated Our room was to the quiet side of the building so no noise problems either 
323123,Hotel Johann Strauss, Breakfast standard could have been a bit better , Room was comfortable warm and had plenty of space Hotel was situated adjacent to an underground station making travel very easy 
323124,Hotel Johann Strauss, Wine selection and beer selection in bar very limited But seating arrangement very comfortable , Staff are very accomodating The room size was very large Easy access across the road to the underground One stop to town 
323125,Hotel Johann Strauss,No Negative, The location was excellent 2 min from a tube station The hotel was clean and the staff was very helpful The internet connection is quick and stable 
323126,Hotel Johann Strauss,No Negative, Very nice hotel in the center close to metro station easy to reach airport to Opera by foot takes 10 min We almost did not use public transport Old charm and atmoaphere in the rooms Good breakfast Polite staff 
323127,Hotel Johann Strauss, 1 They didn t reply to my mail request at booking com 2 I had to explain at reception over 3 times when arrived with following reminder in the evening that we would like to perform payment from company by regular remittance instead of Card where I was assured that in the morning I d get Invoice Next morning new shift I happened to know that they don t know anything about my request I spent there another 15 minutes I had to hurry up dtto appointed meeting to get Proforma invoice 3 When we were leaving to airport I asked reception to call small or mid size van taxi for group of 4 person I have raised their attention exactly to van type of a car several times having experienced previous issue with Invoice They called regular car and told ONLY upon arrival of a car that there was no van and even didn t ask me either we would like to get two cars in this case , Indeed nice breakfast and wonderful location for walking at weekends or public transport for business traveling
323128,Hotel Johann Strauss, I made little mistake in the date of arrivel while booking and informed the hotel directly five minits after booking for changing date However they were not cooperative in changing dates considered it as a annulatio while question was to change date one day and already took the money from my bank account 12 days before the wrong date of arrival A shame for a hotel that calls itself friendly and honnest to their costumers My advice when you need a friendly hotel pleased skip this one,No Positive
323129,Hotel Johann Strauss, No tea coffee making facilities in the room and no tea available in the lobby which is often the case in other hotels , It was my 2nd stay and I enjoyed the hotel again Good room size comfortable bed high quality of sleep Very good breakfast and the breakfast room is spacious which is very nice and enjoyable to start the day Staff is professional and helpful Good internet there is a minibar in the room 
323130,Hotel Johann Strauss, Please remove the outgoing wood frame from the beds I hit my head on it two days in a row That is my only complain So it must be a good review, We got a nice big and quiet room towards Floragasse A good breakfast and the staff was very friendly 
323131,Hotel Johann Strauss, A little draught from the windows but may be compensated by heating, Convenient location close to metro station good breakfast helpful staff pleasant atmosphere classic music and interiors
323132,Hotel Johann Strauss, The only window was sealed up with solid plastic cover so there wasn t much fresh air inside I didn t stay for a second night , Within walking distance from the city centre Room space is ok and clean enough and well equipped 
323133,Hotel Johann Strauss,No Negative, Spacious room with old fashioned furniture music related decorations Very helpful and nice staff who provided many advises during our short stay WIFI is stable and w o password Breakfast is normal but still decent and relaxing Location is just excellent downstairs there s a U bahn one stop to Wien Hbf and 10min walk to old town 
323134,Hotel Johann Strauss, Breakfast buffet menu is almost same every day though the food is fresh nice , Small and old hotel but very nice room and comfortable There are many drawings sketches of old Wien town hanging on the wall in the corridor Champagne is served at every breakfast and that is one of the reason I chose this hotel 
323135,Hotel Johann Strauss, At 6 o clock in the morning someone made very bad noises Very dark Room No light very annoying Old and small TV For the breakfast they put a small coffee machine which was very slow and produced small amount of coffee and you had to stand few minutes in a line of guest to reach it , Big and clean room
323136,Hotel Johann Strauss, We were awoken at 7am the first morning as builders painters erected scaffolding outside our window We had not been advised that this would happen Our room was not cleaned one of the days even though we were out for much of it Breakfast was adequate but could have been improved by some fresh fruit salad , The location was fantastic It s just a 5 10 minute walk from Karlplatz and the Opera 15 minutes from the Museum Quarter and 2 minutes from the Underground The rooms were bright and comfortable 
323137,Hotel Johann Strauss, The lift was very cosy but enjoyed using the stairs , Breakfast was great particularly the mornings we had salmon with the crossoints and I enjoyed the bubbly each morning also Well placed for enjoyment of the tourist spots nearby and the nearby metro was frequent Some good restaurants and supermarkets nearby 
323138,Hotel Johann Strauss, Really nice stay Few complaints Could benefit from deadbolt on door in room and pillows need updating , Great location away from the super busy area but easy walk and steps to a subway stop Air conditioning comfy bed but pillows need updating good selection for included breakfast very clean 
323139,Hotel Johann Strauss, The toilet is separate from the bathroom but there is no sink to wash your hands you must go across the room to the bathroom, Excellent position not far from downtown in a quiet location and in front of metro station free WiFi The staff were very friendly welcoming and efficient Most places you d want to visit in a radius of 1 5 km I would definitely choose this hotel again 
323140,Hotel Johann Strauss, On Booking com it says the single room has tea coffee making facilities in the room There was none When asked I was told they had already informed booking com and if it was not rectified they were not responsible 2 lights in the room were not working but these were attended to once informed My room was getting cold in the night as it was raining outside and the heater didn t appear to be working This I informed at the desk but there was no change in the performance There is no iron in the room as mentioned on booking com but was told I can be given one when I needed it Bed was not very comfortable , The breakfast had a decent spread but it was the same everyday Location is just outside the Taubstummgasse metro station and convenient to get to work other sites 
323141,Hotel Johann Strauss, When I fluffed my pillow an old contact lens belonging to someone else fell out of the pillow I thought that was very unsanitary and disgusting I requested for the sheets and pillows to be changed immediately To be fair they complied right away Also hotel is not deserving of four stars It s old dusty I could see the dust on all the surfaces like the shelves and the desk and dark Housekeeping at this hotel is clearly not done well , The staff were very friendly welcoming and efficient They checked me in quickly and arranged for my airport transfer the next day Also great location Decent breakfast 
323142,Hotel Johann Strauss, only 2 spare power outlets one of which is near the door no facilities like sauna pool fitnes how did they get 4 stars the breakfast is ok but still not what you would expect from the 4 star hotel, The staff and the building itself
323143,Hotel Johann Strauss, There was no writing paper in the room And I did not bring paper with me A little ways from city center , The staff were extremely helpful with all my requests They went out of their way in helping me resolve some problems such as not having an extension to my European wall adaptor to successfully charge my cell phone They had a charger and let me use it on more than one occasion 
323144,Hotel Johann Strauss, A room that I was booked was presented at Booking com as much more spacious and comfortable In reality I have obtained a much smaller and less comfortable room which was poorly equipped not even similar to the one presented in pictures Also it was far below 20m2 as it was advertised It is not fair policy Tomorrow evening after my first night there I noticed that the staff missed to clean the room even no basic service was done , Very kind staff Good breakfast good WiFi Perfect location to visit main touristic attractions in Vienna 
323145,Hotel Johann Strauss,No Negative, The allergy free Jr Suite was large and clean as advertised no feather bedding Good sized bathroom Staff was helpful with 1 exception Full Austrian style buffet breakfast served in basement level room no view outside had many protein options The breakfast Johann Strauss waltzs playing for background music get repetitive by Day 2 or 3 but it is the name of the hotel While it s not in the inner city ring the subway is within a block 
323146,Hotel Johann Strauss, There could have an extra pillow and shampoo and shower gel, Breakfast pretty satisfying Clean room and spacious staff really kind and helpful So close to metro station taubstumengasse Easy access to city center 10 taxi to cat station
323147,Hotel Johann Strauss, Still no coffee tea facilities in the room Detail our room didn t have power sockets near the bed which is easy if your cell phone serves as an alarm clock This however is not the case in every room , Very helpful and professional staff Great location 10 minute walk from the city center Extensive breakfast The rooms we got on the second floor were renovated last year when we were there and thus probably some of the best standard rooms in the hotel 
323148,Hotel Johann Strauss, The standard rooms are rather small but comfortable altogether In room coffee tea making facilities would be great to have , Great location right in front of metro station free WiFi and free breakfast yummy breakfast buffet with extensive choice for all tastes I especially liked the variety of fresh breads 
323149,Hotel Johann Strauss, The furniture could be newer The pillows were extremely soft, Location was excellent just the nearbay of metro station Staff was friendly Breakfast with Strauss music was a privelage and breakfast menu was rich
323150,Hotel Johann Strauss, The pillows were way too soft , Big comfortable room delicious breakfast and excellent location a few steps from the metro station and 5 minutes from the city center Would definitely stay here again 
323151,Hotel Johann Strauss, Toilet and bath shouldn t be in different places , Great breakfast big and comfortable room friendly staff 1 minute walk from the metro station comfortable beds 2 stations from the centre

323156,Hotel Johann Strauss, Sound proof is just bad Hotel personal had loud conversations in the mornings It s not a problem for those who wake up at 7 AM but for me it was annoying I wanted to sleep till 9 AM couple times but they woke me up , Location is very good walking distance from the center and most places you d want to visit It s also only 20 minutes by foot from the CAT train to airport if you have hand luggage no need to use metro Breakfasts were good with a nice variety of meals juices types of coffee and champagne 
323157,Hotel Johann Strauss, the elevator is old very small and slowly slippers lack is inadmissible at a 4 star hotel lucky me that I brought mine from home rooms could be better soundproofed the cleaning lady makes noise in the morning slamming doors, lovely place to stay in Vienna good position shops and restaurants nearby and easy enough to walk downtown in the city center or if you re tired to take the metro which is 50 m from the hotel big rooms even if a little outdated but clean it was really cleaned every day very good breakfast buffet and the music at the breakfast just loved it makes you feel happy and it s a good start of the day to visit a very beautiful city friendly staff good WiFi in the room

323161,Hotel Johann Strauss, Soundproofing between rooms isn t the best , Great open plan design with no dingy little corridors to walk dowm to get to your room Fabulous view from my top floor room 
323162,Hotel Johann Strauss, The only improvement I could suggest is the coffee situation in the morning The espresso machine takes a tad bit of time and creates a high waiting time I suggest having a large pot of coffee also available I m just being nit picky though , Overall the hotel was great in terms of location and price It s located literally 45 seconds away from the metro station on foot The breakfast package we selected was a great option Tons of delicious breakfast items to choose from Our room was spacious with very high ceilings The staff was very friendly 
323163,Hotel Johann Strauss, Possibly a bit expensive some of the days overall for my stay was expensive but ok , Huge room with a view to the street WiFi was good with no problems with many devices Breakfast was really good
