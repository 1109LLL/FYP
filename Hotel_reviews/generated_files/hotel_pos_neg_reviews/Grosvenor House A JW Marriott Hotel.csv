395944,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, Air conditioning in the room was very noisy room 275 has what looks like the main plant to the building outside the window noisy all night This is an expensive hotel you would assume that you could get a good nights sleep If booking go 3rd or 4th floor up , The staff were very good

395949,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, I didn t particularly liked the food of the room service order at 1 00am It was delivered pretty quick perhaps wasn t so fresh the pasta was badly overcooked and the ceaser salad there was way too much sauce compare how much salad there was shame really as the few lettuce I could test did taste quite fresh We also ordered an hamburger that was slightly better but still for the comparison quality price NO GOOD for me I do have to say that when I checked out I have gently complained to the reception and with much apologies and with no effort they haven t charge me for the ceaser salad and the pasta , I liked the bedroom especially the size of the bed and the shower bath I liked all the staff that was very helpful all the way through outstanding from the concierge to the receptionist 
395950,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, They were doing a complete renovation on the 7th floor above the 6th where they placed me Hammers saws ungodly noise Staff was rude when changing Would never recommend this nightmare hotel ,No Positive
395951,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, 1 I made my booking through Booking com type Deluxe King Room but I surprised when I checked in that this type of rooms did not exist originally and could not communicate with the management of Booking com Because there is no address to communicate in website 2 Upon check in they gave me a room for disabled people for one night 3 The front disc manager did t come to solve the problem and when I asked for it they told me that it was busy and after that she came , Comfortable and location

395953,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, I felt the corridors were just a bit tired looking with some patches of worn carpet the guest room was also a bit old looking and we viewed on to a dull drab back court area had I been there on vacation or a longer stay I would have asked for a move , the flower displays in the foyer were just gorgeous and the staff were friendly and helpful we had afternoon tea and it was good and very nicely presented Breakfast was very good with loads to chose from and our server was great and very helpful 
395954,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, free Wifi would have improved my overall stay especially when pay such a high price just for a room also free parking for guests should be included , the food served in the Steakhouse was excellent highly recommend it 
395955,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, We booked a twin room and were told on arrival that there were none available After some time and an attempt at trying to get us to spend even more money on an upgraded room or an additional single bed the receptionist told us she had found a superior room with twin beds but it wouldn t be available until later in the day This was fine as we were spending the day in the city On arriving back to the hotel we were given our room keys and excitedly went to the room expecting a superior twin room Instead we got a standard room with one king sized bed I immediately rang down to reception and explained the situation The receptionist sounded surprised that we wanted a twin room and offered to send someone up to split the beds No one arrived for a good half an hour by which time we went in the middle of getting ready for our evening event being held at the hotel We send the member of staff away and asked him to come after 7 00 when we would have vacated the room 10 minutes later a member of housekeeping arrived with bedding for the twin beds we also sent her away asked her to come back later All this inconvenience certainly impacted on our overall experience and left us wondering why we had chosen to stay at a 5 hotel when clearly the service didn t match the rating I m not sure I would recommend the Grosvenor House Hotel to others after our experience , Friendly staff good location
395956,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, The food particularly breakfast was truly terrible I have actually had better in a Premier Inn Eggs seemed to be powdered sausages did not taste good pastries were dry coffee tasted like instant Not at all impressed It also took over an hour to serve me cocktails in the Park room I eventually had to get up and ask to be served , An opulent feel Piano in the Park Room was a nice touch

395958,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, Better level of decoration for a 5 star hotel it was looking a bit tired in our room which was billed as a deluxe double, The staff were just the best and the food although incredibly expensive was fantastic
395959,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, the rooms on booking com are not of the regular rooms but rather the executive suites All the other rooms are not renovated and very dated they placed us on a smoking floor although we booked a twin room non smoking no one showed us where the coffee is the Starbucks in the hotel does not taste like Starbucks the wifi is not for free the receptionist did not give us a card for our luggage however later the concierge asked us for the card and gave us a hard time for not having it, It was easy to find a taxi

395962,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, The girls standing in the lobby to welcome guests and help them were not friendly and were behaving more like security personnels Wasn t welcomimg at all No sweet smiles, The bed was comfortable and staff were really nice in particular the valet guys The entrance gate was closed as there was some red carpet event going on when we arrived The valet boys took charge straight away by taking our car to park it and took our bags out They took care of our initial arrival 
395963,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, There was nothing we didn t like at hotel however we attended the royal variety performance and were at the banquet A security guard caused chaos and was very rude to us and another group of three insisting we were not allowed in unless we removed our jackets He said this was hotel policy We asked to see manager but never did and eventually he allowed us all to enter It put a damper on that function, Elegance friendliness professionalism All amazing
395964,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, Why stop serving wine and food i the Executive Lounge at a time when guests are returning from theatre shows etc Even some cheeses biscuits bread would be nice with a glass of wine Really cheap And the breakfast is chaotic When myself and my wife got up from our table to get some cooked food leaving our half finished fruit juices and coffee s on the table we returned to find some people had taken our places and the table had been cleared We had to find somewhere else to sit This happened to two other couples whilst we were there , Nice room good outlook onto Hyde Park great pillows

395966,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, Just putting gold paint on reproduction antique furniture does not make it classy quite the opposite The decor was very random and lacking a coherent style , The staff were wonderfully polite and friendly without doing resorting to the insincere bowing and scraping you get at some hotels The bed was incredibly comfortable Very hard to leave 
395967,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, 1 I requested red rose petals on the bed for my wife as we stayed in the hotel for our 10 year wedding anniversary My request was ignored with no explanation 2 Pillows were too high and there was no option for flatter pillows in the room I did not get a good night sleep 3 Breakfast was very basic compared to other 5 star hotels Not enough vegetarian options 4 Wifi is not free 5 The shower in the bathroom has 2 heads the portable head did not work only the overhead rain shower worked I m disappointed in the value for money , The location is good and the staff are pleasant Checking in was easy Facilities are decent bar and afternoon tea dining area 
395968,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, Bedroom was very poor quality for nearly 300 for the night Admittedly I arrived early this attend an event at the hotel and rather than leave my bags until check in time I was offered early check in into a smaller room with complimentary breakfast an offer that I accepted However I hadn t expected the room to be so small and cramped even for single occupancy I struggled to find enough surface space for my belongings plus kettle etc The bed was small with a very soft sloping mattress that made me feel I was rolling out of bed It was a very uncomfortable night and very poor value for money , Lovely hotel A repeat stay for me and in this occasion it was particularly convenient as I was attending an event there on the same day 
395969,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, Location of the room inside view I could see only the pipelines Bathroom water sewage was very slow to go so I had to reduce control the water flow , Cleanliness room service laundry service

395981,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, Where to start 1 Reception employees are way too rude and don t belong to 5 stars chain hotels 2 Cleaneness of the room is a disaster 3 When you call house keeping no one appears to care about your logical demands I had to call three times to get my room cleaned then I approached reception where I was promised to get the service needed immediately but guess what NO ONE CAME TO THE ROOM 4 If you call concierge you d be lucky if someone attend to your call 5 The bath top is so old the water does not get drained You d get soaked in dirty water and soap And when you ask for the issue to be repaired you d be lucky if they ever intend to do it 6 The mattress is so old your back will suffer and you d need to seek for medical help by the time you re trip is over 7 The waiterses at the steak house where breakfast is served are out of knowledge of the basic hospitality issues This hotel does not deserve the huge amount of money I ve paid for The service I received at this hotel I would assume a no star hotel would offer One thing for certain I WILL NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN , The only good thing about this hotel is the great location

395985,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, We would have liked a swimming pool to be available somewhere nearby if not on the premises Also the pianist playing in the lounge lobby would have been very welcome some evenings rather than just some afternoons , Everything was lovely although the food was ridiculously expensive
395986,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, I think the hotel is starting to get a little tiered the beds are very soft the air con doesn t work very well The rest of the hotel is great , The service was always with a smile they always tried to help from the doorman to the reception The staff in the executive club room were amazing

395989,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, I didn t like to be asked if I did not like any thing in this hotel It is amazing , I like always to be a reasonable in giving my feedback about any service The first rule of me being reasonable is to avoid giving extreme rates such as 1 very poor and 10 very excellent However I asked myself why is not a reasonable to give 10 from 10 for such amazing experience with JW Marriott Hotel Grosvenor House I felt ashamed to not give 10 I should always give 10 for many reasons and one condition I got since I started my relation with this hotel The reasons could not be all included in my current memory and my busy time in my PhD study But I have several examples One is when I arrived several times to this hotel before 12 pm I knew that I should wait till 3 pm to be checked in but I learnt with this hotel that I could always get my room Every time I got my room around 12 pm which is big thing for me Second is when I meet every member of the hotel I got the feeling of how they are professional Being professional in the context of hotel services is scarcely to been seen Third is how clean their rooms are Fourth is how delicious their food is Fifth is how I missed my staying in their hotel It is difficult for me to miss any place that not my house but I missed their hotel I just listed several examples Now it is about my condition with this hotel I am living in the north of England This hotel is expensive for my budget I love visiting London BUT since I knew this hotel this is what happened to me I cannot go many times to London because my feeling cannot accept any hotel if it was not Grosvenor House which is expensive for me So instead of going to London many times in one year I save the money of the many times to be able to go few times to London with the ability of staying at their hotel I had several experiences with other nice hotels in London such as the Savoy hotel but since I knew this hotel I cannot book a train to London before book a staying at this hotel

396000,Grosvenor House A JW Marriott Hotel, The fact that breakfast service stops at 11 am is a bid old fashioned given the lifestyles and behaviors of the clientele Although they might be older by passport they stay up long sleep in and then would like to have a proper breakfast even when its 1pm The person preparing the Starbucks coffee had no idea milk overheated although great coffee bad preparation , loved the location and the service very much Starbucks coffee available
