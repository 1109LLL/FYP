439850,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, The hotel is beautifully decorated and definitely different from what I have seen of late The staff were super helpful most of the times and we really enjoyed making use of the pool area They make killer sangria cocktails as well 
439851,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The air conditioner was a heater and the staff was not humble and they were extremely rude and one of the most pathetic and uncomfortable experience ever will not recommend HOTEL ESPANA ever , Nothing
439852,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, Great hotel Service excellent Bar restaraunt bar pool area great My only concern was our room was a little bit small otherwise a great place to stay
439853,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The elevators were very small and it would have been nice if the building hallways were air conditioned , The room was very clean We had a great experience with the front desk personnel 
439854,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, No complaints, Lovely hotel 100 metres from La Ramblas Friendly helpful staff Very comfortable beds Rooftop terrace with a bar pool Walking distance to Port Vell and Barcelonetta beach area 
439855,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Our room had a little window onto the vertical wall garden While beautiful a bit more natural light would have been lovely We did however get all the natural light we needed in the rooftop plunge pool and the al aire bar , This was the most beautiful hotel we ve ever stayed at The pictures on booking com and the hotel s website do not do it justice It has to be seen to be believed We were checked in very quickly which is great when you ve travelled all day The staff at reception gave us a map and recommended where to go in the city Our room was a superior double and met all of our needs We didn t avail of many of the hotel s facilities as we spent our time exploring the city however we did come back to the rooftop bar a few nights to grab a drink The food and drinks are very very reasonably priced for such a gorgeous setting We were grateful for the always working air con in our room and to have had our fridge restocked with water and juice each day It was the perfect spot to stay to enjoy the city central a 20 second walk to the rambla 2 minutes from the Boquer a market but also hidden away from the busy main street meaning you get a great nights sleep I look forward to revisiting 
439856,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, As soon as you walk in the hotel amazes you So luxurious with friendly staff on reception 24 7 The decor of the hotel is just amazing from the grand piano to the landing to the rooms The bed was extremely comfy and very big as well as a walk in shower and soft towels Rooms also very nice and cool in hot temperatures Hotel was always spotless and smelt amazing with nice touches such as fresh pineapple juice in your fridge every morning Also had computer and printer downstairs to print off any tickets you may need whilst staying here such as Camp Nou or Sagrada Famillia Such a luxurious feel whilst staying here and would definitely return again soon 
439857,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The darkness of the room No natural light If I stayed again which I would love too I would need a room with a window , The bedding was extremely fresh n silky and the room was impeccable clean
439858,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Tapas ordered from the rooftop bar was served luke warm cold However service and drinks were spot on , Jordi was very helpful helped us to the room and gave us helpful information about our room and Barcelona The room was clean and comfortable The terrace was a great choice to relax and have a drink in the sun and in the night 
439859,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, Our stay was made extra special because of the friendly and knowledgeable staff of local high quality eateries away from tourist hot spots Thank you to Tom at the front desk for all his recommendations He is a keeper 
439860,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Lighting in the bathroom was awful Clearly designed by a man as it was impossible to apply makeup with spotlights harshly shining down from above Really irritating , Rituals toiletries architecture of the hotel gorgeous design features
439861,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Housekeeping was inconsistent Sometimes the complimentary water and body lotion wasn t replaced , Very helpful reception Perfect location Big bowl of sweets on the reception Loved the pool 
439862,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, the room was excellent zero noise from outside during the night air conditioning was also excellent really recommend the roof terrace bar of an evening
439863,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, Only 70m to Las Ramblas main street and the action but nice and quiet to sleep in a good sized room Easy walk to everywhere Nice restaurant if you wanted it although we sampled local food all the time Staff were really helpful Nice facilities 
439864,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Small room no view noisy room breakfast not included in room rate expensive bar no late check out We were woken up very early in the morning with the housekeeping staff making noise in the reception area at 6 30am in the morning this is because our room was on the first floor and the bathroom had a window rather than a wall so they need to sound proof the room so there is no noise, Bed comfy and clean room good location
439865,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Nothing to not like , Amazing stylish Hotel right next to Las Rambla very helpful friendly staff will definitely stay here again Perfect holiday for my wife s Birthday 10 10 
439866,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, We couldn t fault the hotel , The hotel was in a fabulous location All staff extremely friendly from check in through to check out Breakfast was excellent and the rooftop bar and terrace was a real added bonus away from the hustle and bustle of La Ramblas Just great ambience The rooms were spacious clean and the beds and pillows particularly comfortable Overall a fantastic stay in a fantastic hotel in a fantastic city Many thanks 
439867,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Noisy hotel guests returning from a night on the town slamming doors shouting But what can the hotel do about it Very sound isolation over all did not hear a thing from neighboring rooms otherwise , First class restaurant in a stunning architectural setting Worthwhile visiting even when staying elsewhere Whole building is a site in itself Large and very comfortable bed functional modern design Perfectly working free wifi 
439868,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Not enough sun loungers on roof top terrace but that s only if I m being picky , Staff were very friendly and extremely helpful Very clean and an excellent location just off la rambla
439869,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, ground floor bar looked inviting to sit and have an evening drink but it was closed and only used for special events like weddings and not generally used until October which is a bit odd , best restaurant dinner ever along with the service
439870,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, did a lot accommodation reservation via booking for my trips this is the first time that I wrote email to ask about airport hotel pick up service but no reply at all so we took to taxi by ourself after arrival Some hotel staff not very friendly to offer help, Compact room but comfortable
439871,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The wait for a taxi to the airport took a while but then Barcelona is a very busy and manic city Driving is probably challenging , Loved pretty much every aspect of this hotel However a special mention for the rooftop terrace which was very nice indeed Attentive bar staff excellent wine and very good food Beautifully decorated as well All staff were first class throughout the hotel 
439872,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The rooms are on the smaller side the mini bar holds only water and rooms located towards the inner courtyard tend to be dark with barely any daylight rooms with balcony towards the pedestrian Zone are more expensive and could be noisier and don t reall have a view either , The Hotel is in a great location and is beatifully designed in an old city house 
439873,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Maybe the noise early in the morning but did not bother me I am on vacation so I ll enjoy every minute, The location is the best close to everything in downtown Barcelona especially the great street las Ramblas very cute hotel receptionist very helpful the food excellent the roof top bar is very good they open very late and their drinks are yummyyy mostly everything 
439874,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Small room Not the most clean hotel Some of the lamps did not worked No shelves in yhe closet 2 meter high mirror fell from the wall on yhe bed , Location Staff super nice 
439875,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Nothing, From the minute you walk through the door your breath is taken away with the ultra cool historical building The staff are so friendly and accommodating and the breakfast first class The rooms well equipped and stylish lovely bathrooms and nicely decorated Finally must mention the roof top terrace bar order the club sandwich to die for First class hotel in a first class city 
439876,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Size of room poor daylight because II was on the 2nd floor and was told that rooms booked through Booking com are always on the cheaper lower floors I blame booking com for that situation,No Positive
439877,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, fried breakfast cold every day frugal with tea making facilities 2 teabags 2 minute cartons of milk no biscuits no spoons His Her washbasins totally impractical with it architecture gone mad , bed shower air con roof terrace reception staff
439878,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Our room was on the first floor and lacked an attractive view but we were in Barcelona and didn t spend much time in the room, The staff may have been the most helpful I have dealt with helped explain how the room works cleaning services best eats how to get around The rooms were extremely clean 
439879,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, The good thing about the hotel for those to whom swimming matters is the small but adequte pool on the roof This is useable 9 to 9 betweeen June and August For young travelers there s a sunning area and a bar open til about 2 30 in the morning Other than that it s a poorly designed boutique hotel The view out the window was of Barcelona families getting cool on their balconies about six feet away Both nights somebody maybe a resident or residents set out to bark and howl to get resident dogs across the street to do the same at which they were very successful We suspect that the local families poor are not thrilled that a hotel for rich foreigners has a nightclub functioning on the roof until all hours of the morning and take their revenge Other design details of hotel the shower door only opens enough for a body to squeeze through The air conditioning wasn t effective at cooling in June heat and because of the closeness of the local neighbors we couldn t keep the one window open at night Most rooms on an inside courtyard are under a glass roof so have no air circulation A few are not under the roof and might be more private and airier The boutique design is all sharp corners on beds and furniture great for bumping shins Although a queen bed would have been adequate for two people ours was a King which let almost no space in the very small room No desk only one chair The decor gray walls mixed with gold panels combines gaudy with dreary in a way we ve never before seen There were a few old tiles in the floor and nice iron work along stairways indicating that this was a lovely building before it was improved This is a tremendously overpriced hotel 180 per night for what it offers My recommendation is to choose a hotel a little bit out of the Ramblas Barrio G tico neighborhood in a less crowded and more fairly priced area 
439880,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Our room backed onto a hostel which was noisy at night, The staff were very friendly breakfast was delicious and the hotel is in a very central position close to all the attractions of the city 
439881,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, shower was strange in that the door opened outwards and when you came out of the shower the water leaked all over the floor not so good, comfy bed air condition
439882,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, Great hotel very charming with modern amenities Breakfast was fabulous Planning to go back to Barcelona and will definitely try to book Hotel Espana again 
439883,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Internet could have been stronger The internet works fine for surfing but not for downloading or streaming movies if you have jet leg and your partner doesn t The space around the bed was very tight but we did have a lot of room on the other side of the bed where there was a desk and balcony , There was plenty of closet space and the beds were very comfortable If you close the shutters you can t hear the street noise room 405 was the bigger size of the standard rooms and it has a balcony we were very happy AC worked great we had some issues when we first arrived with the AC but it was fixed immediately It could have been user error 
439884,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, This was a very central hotel An old building with a modern interior It was very clean The staff were very helpful The roof terrace is a fantastic place to sit and chill out Would definitely return 
439885,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Breakfast included , Hotel and rooms are exactly as pictured As mentioned by other reviews the toilet door seems to make you feel claustrophobic if closed while you re using the porcelain throne Our first day we graced some noodles from down the street and sat on the balcony watching the world go by The hotel while renovated and modern pays homage to its past with tiles and reliefs filling the hallways and staircases I especially loved the Mermaid Room where breakfast is served We made use of the rooftop pool had a drink at the bar and at all times staff were professional friendly and courteous 
439886,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, Great Service very helpful and friendly staff excellent location was here the third time and will be back Despite the location quiet rooms are available not facing the street of course 
439887,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The size of the room for 2 people was misleading as very small and there was only 2 sachets of decaf no proper coffee in bedroom which you would expect when paying that much, Staff were very friendly
439888,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, The location is excellent just off La Rambla The hotel is old world charm with a modern touch Spacious rooms and bathroom as well Has a small dipping pool on rooftop as well as bar area 
439889,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, No windows to daylight in the room Hotel room was actually very worn out with lots of chips etc on furniture , Breakfast was amazing although v pricy if not included Amazing pool and rooftop scenario Entrance and lobby area absolutely beautiful Couldnt ask for a more central location 
439890,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Air conditioning did not always work that well at night but was not a problem, Hot and Cold breakfast buffet was great Room included Tea and Coffee as well as Bar fridge with Complementary juice and Water Bathroom was mod and included a bath and good shower combo Robes and Slippers were included Location was the best
439891,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Small rooms I ve never stayed in a room this tiny Poor room service they didn t make our room the first day We had to tell them twice to clean our room before it was done I ve never stayed in a hotel with so thin walls we could hear everything our neighbours talked about and we were even woken up by the room service in other rooms and neighbours coming back to the hotel in the middle of the night several times Room service even called outside our door despite the Do not disturb sign was up , Comfortable bed Great location easy access to shopping and not far from the beach
439892,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Having checked in and having been allocated a room the manager decided that the room was too good for me and it should be allocated to another My luggage and valuables locked in the safe were removed in my absence Personal possessions locked in a safe should remain private They should not be accessed without permission in my view The new room 307 turned out to be very noisy and the bathroom plumbing did not work Dirty water was deposited on the floor from a leaking waste I needed to paddle in dirty water from the wash basin the only saving grace was it was my dirty water The sound proofing between rooms was abysmal The normal level conversation in the adjoining room kept me awake The noise level from the street was also high with the window closed and curtains drawn Guess a single night stay was not sufficient to warrant a decent room despite the 200 a night price tag Would never go back , The hotel had modern facilities The breakfast was good and It was central to the city centre The roof terrace bar was a good place to relax 
439893,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The bathroom door is actually largely made up of a frosted glass panel With the lights on you can pretty much see through it It was slightly awkward as I was traveling with my dad , Location of the hotel is great if you are looking to be in the centre of the hustle and bustle of the city It is located on a side road just off La Rambla so it is not so noisy Plaza Catalunya is only a 10 min walk where you can catch the airport shuttle and the hop on hop off tour buses A 10 min walk in the other direction brings you to the habour The hotel itself is very stylishly decorated and they even provide a common computer and printer in the lobby if you need to print documents The room we had was also nicely designed with light switches located on the bedside stands for easy access The beds were also very comfortable 
439894,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, We had to change rooms as some of the rooms in this hotel do not have windows so if one is at all claustrophobic these rooms can be challenging Also the pool is very small the lobby bar was not open while we were there although it looked lovely and the roof top bar restaurant although nicely designed does not provide a view and the food was very disappointing , Location is good staff are very professional and competent the rooms and bathrooms are very nice completely renovated and brand new 
439895,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, If you request two single beds you have no guarantee of getting this Should not advertise twin beds for rooms if they cannot supply them , Rooftop pool and Bar Rooms were nice and comfortable Good location
439896,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, When we checked in the staff were abrupt except for a young male employee We were not made welcome The lobby is very small and uncomfortable No refreshments were offered After getting our room The bathroom floor needed renewing and an overhaul There was no outside window But we were out all day and it was only 2 nights , The breakfast was good and different options the bed was comfortable The saving point was of course the location 
439897,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The shower door did not prevent water going into the bathroom making the floor very slippery The room temperature could not be reduced any lower than 19 deg c and there was little flow of air from the air conditioning, Good location very central Quiet Good access to the Metro Very clean Friendly staff
439898,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The room was soooo small tiny No place where to hang anything And little noisy Our room seemed to be right in the corridor , Loved the Staff very helpful Gave us great advice and the restaurant suggestion was amazing Bar El Ca ete Breakfast was very good and complete 
439899,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Rooms are minuscule We arrived exhausted after long flight from the US The staff found us a small but adequate room admittedly before stated arrival time About 3 minutes after we lay down for a nap not unusual time for a siesta in Barcelona loud banging in wall by our heads A workman was pulling out the tiles in the bathroom of the neighboring room and would be doing that for at least an hour The staff graciously changed our room but to an even smaller one with not only no luggage rack but no place to put one if there were The tiny bathroom would have been OK but was terribly designed A fashionable extremely shallow trough sink took up the entire meter wide space for it leaving no dry room to leave your stuff When we opened the shade we look ed out at a wall a meter away We spent very little time in the room over four nights so we managed , Location excellent restaurant downstairs funky tapas bar on fifth floor roof clean rooms helpful staff 
439900,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Only provided de caff coffee in room Room too hot a c seemed to be on central control Price was more expensive for single occupancy usually it s less for single use in Spanish hotels , Rooftop terrace location short walk from Plaza Catalu a for Aerobus Boqueria market Gothic quarter restaurant we had a great dinner 
439901,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Everything was ideal There was nothing we didn t like , Front desk staff were more than just helpful They were welcoming and always attentive The rooftop terrace was a haven at the end of a long day of touring The bar food was yummy and the room was perfect 
439902,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Surrounding area was somewhat unsafe and full of unsavoury characters Barcelona such a beautiful city but Spanish tradition is not there unfortunately many of the tapas bars and restaurants were not typical Spanish , Friendly and helpful staff the hotel itself was a mixture of contemporary modern design but still keeping in with historical antiquated architecture 
439903,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, We loved the location of the hotel the style and the super helpful and friendly staff We would 100 reccomend this hotel and I hope to be back one day 
439904,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Only that we could stay just one night This is an ideal location for spending a week to see Barcelona , Great location very quiet super comfortable beds spacious room excellent friendly helpful staff 
439905,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, Great location The room was large enough and we loved out terrace It is only a couple minute walk to La Rambla but it is far enough away the noise was never an issue We loved the bar in the lobby Great pricing and good drinks Would stay again in a heartbeat 
439906,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The staff being so rude telling everyone to shhh every time someone spoke and especially at night the night staff the old man threatened to call the police and actually pretended like he was on the phone to them because we were eating Mcdonalds downstairs this is unacceptable behaviour the staff need more training that guy is a pr1 ck , That it was close to everything 
439907,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Bearing in mind we stayed in their best room with terrrace Bathroom was very impractical wash basins are tiny with no water depth Issues with hot water availability issues with shower leaks issues with basin tap which wouldnt stay on loo paper and tissues not replenished very poor standard of daily room clean generally poorly maintained bed very hard for our tastes no drawers for clothes and no space to put suitcases , Location Style Terrace size good reception staff breakfast ok but expensive
439908,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The bar and pool were closed due to the rain and there were some weird noises at night from the neighbors, The Design and the value for the price you pay The restroom was fantastic so big and the funky design
439909,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The lobby was too small The people at the front desk were not very friendly , The location was excellent The room was nice We did not get to eat in the restaurant 
439910,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Nothing, A wonderful historic but boutique style hotel in the very centre of the Ramblas with excellent rooftop bar and ground floor restaurant if your feet are sore with walking all day
439911,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, That I hadn t stayed in places like this my entire trip , Everything was amazing The ambience the included breakfast delicious the helpful and friendly staff and the location Fabulous place to stay I loved the mermaid room s tile work wonderful Clean modern and comfortable Highly recommend 
439912,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Noisy dogs constantly barking from apartments below the windows obviously not the hotels fault Not a full size ironing board very difficult to iron shirts, the sweets at reception 
439913,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, A little hard to find and my taxi taking me there was not able to get me to the actual hotel but I didn t have to walk far at all , I did not have time to eat breakfast so can t comment on that Staff was very helpful in getting me an early morning taxi to the airport 
439914,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, I bit of noise from outside if balcony door open at night , Great location friendly and accommodating staff good value for money lovely breakfast each day
439915,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The room was very modern and clean but a bit too small, The perfect location for exploring the beautiful city of Barcelona the staff were so friendly and helpful
439916,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, I loved everything about this hotel it definitely goes in my top 3 hotels to stay in The staff were wonderful and nothing was too much trouble The hotel was beautiful comfortable and relaxing some days we had trouble leaving because we just did want to On my next visit to Barcelona I really can t see me staying anywhere else 
439917,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, We were on honeymoon and just had a lovely time in the hotel the central location was fantastic The staff were really helpful and the rooms were big and really clean 
439918,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The hotel food including breakfast was rather pricey With so many nearby restaurants there was however no need to eat in , A beautifully restored hotel close to La Rambla Convenient Metro stop nearby and only a few minutes walk for access to the hop on hop off tourist buses Interior light wells of the hotel spectacular Free mini bar with coffee tea water and fruit juice 
439919,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, nothing about the hotel in general i was shocked when i was walking to las ramblas with my wife back from dinner after 11pm and you could see women in the street doing business and the police ignoring the situation few meters away i think that your management should put pressure to the local authorities to clean up the area this migt affect your business in the future, the hotel has character and the staff is very polite and happy to help also they speak good english the rooms are stylish and they have a nice lighting also very clean and with good size for a european hotel 
439920,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Bigger cups for hot drinks in the room was the only thing to note upon, Staff were very friendly service at the bar was impeccable very well kept and clean and the location was perfect
439921,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The room size was too small as against the size mentioned on the site There was no tub in the bathroom as mentioned on the site They give extra benefits if you book directly from the hotel site , The bed was comfy and the ambience good Good connectivity to the public transport system 
439922,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Free wifi was very slow and had a very bad connection For us Internet is one of the most important things when we stay in hotels Double bed would be better if its wider Pillow not comfortable too low and long Breakfast in the room can be better orange juice tasted like its mixed with sparkling water extra plates too eat from would be nicer Bathroom can be cleaner Bathrobe or slippers would have been a nice touch because floor was little bit too cold to walk on I really missed water kettle and hot drink making facilities , Location Amazing design and interior in the lobby and open areas View from the balcony Very soft towels Free drinks from the minibar Very fast service and friendly stuff The portier seemed very friendly and welcoming person 
439923,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The room was on the small side for 2 people Although I was very happy in my exceptionally clean standard room 113 for a 3 day break there was not enough manoeuvring wardrobe or drawer space Half of my clothes had to be draped on the back of a chair There was no space to hide away toiletries That said it is not a complaint just a design flaw I would recommend upgrading to a larger room if you are staying for more than 2 nights I will go back for sure , The hotel was in a perfect central location off the Ramblas easy access to attractions Metro taxis Couldn t be more perfect for a first time visit to Barcelona or if you are a regular visitor like me I will definitely go back to this hotel The staff were very friendly and attentive very comfy bed and pillows I did not have breakfast as it is so near to all sorts of eateries dinner looked fabulous again I did not eat there The bar was cozy tastefully restored and designed I liked the design of the room it was impeccably clean Quiet room free minibar items water and juice was a nice touch The hotel public areas are beautiful a great mix of ancient and modern design Great shower nice glass doors inside the bathroom great design 
439924,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Rooms could be slightly bigger but not a problem at all though still very nice I don t have many bad things to say about this hotel , Excellent breakfast although not the cheapest Perfect location to visit all of the sights a lot of them within walking distance Really nicely designed hotel very modern whilst maintaining all of the classic 19th Century history of the building 
439925,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The neighborhood is a little gritty and at times made me uncomfortable The WIFI was erratic Often could not get email , The ambiance is excellent beautiful hotel with a staff that was friendly and helpful 
439926,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Understand the building being old and beautiful however the location when walking from the left especially at night was not the best Despite this the location in terms of how close to the centre you couldn t fault 30 seconds out the hotel and you were at the centre of Las Ramblas Could not fault anything other than the side street location ,No Positive
439927,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, I can t really complain about the hotel because it exceeded expectations considering it is only a 4 star hotel But if I had to make a negative comment it would be that the shower takes a while to drain which can be annoying when you re standing in a puddle of water Also the shower door couldnt open fully because it would hit the sink We didn t try the breakfast so I can t comment but there seemed to be a lot of choice , The staff were amazing very friendly Valentino welcomed us when we first checked in and gave us a map with the best restaurants to visit The hotel was in a perfect location right on the ramblas which offered a range of restaurants bars and shops with the metro station only 2 mins walk I was hesitant at first after reading reviews about the noise and problems with sleeping so I requested a room further away from the reception The hotel were very accommodating and gave me a room on the 4th floor where I had a perfect sleep no problems with noise from other rooms or the bar located downstairs This hotel is exactly like the photos and just as beautiful in real life It s defiantly luxury for half the price The terrace bar wasn t open when we went but the bar inside had a good vibe not too loud and busy but perfect for a evening drink after dinner 
439928,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, Location was perfect for sightseeing Staff was very helpful Rooms were a good size for Europe My husband loved the jars of licorice and candies at the front desk 
439929,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The staff were always rushing things No one told me where my room was or took the time to explain the amesnities and features of the hotel after checking in , The terrace was big and had an amazing view I would sit in the terrace in the afternoon and watch the sunset 
439930,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The room and The Hotel overall does not look clean Most of the hotel rooms don t have windows to the outside We had a tiny balcony which overlooks the inner patio with glass roof This might be a little disturbing for people who are afraid of closed space, Fantastic location The absolutely fantastic hotel interior You live in a museum of modernism spectacular 
439931,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Tiny room but we were warned , Excellent atmosphere nice and helpful staff super bar and perfect location Breakfast had some nice choices with omelettes etc available Beautiful building cool decor keeping the comfort and a welcoming atmosphere We had a couple small problems our own not the hotel s that the staff made disappear with a smile very appreciated 
439932,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, There was nothing not to like about this hotel, Bar staff brilliant as were all the staff room well equipped and comfortable but could have been a little more spacious having said that the bed was enormous 
439933,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Room a bit small but we were out most of the time so it was adequate enough and it was clean and quiet , Staff very friendly and helpful Hotel quiet and clean Ideally situated for exploring all the different parts of the city 
439934,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, All excellent only thing I would say is that I would ve preferred more natural light in our room , Excellent customer service very friendly staff Beautiful decor and very comfortable beds 
439935,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, We were trapped on ship due to weather We called to delay our arrival but we re charged for the nite we had to spend on ship Bad policy enforcement ,No Positive
439936,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Beds were a bit uncomfortable, Nice bar and service the sangria was just delicious Loved the rainfall shower in the room Breakfast buffet was excellent Location is top notch 
439937,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, We asked the room with the shower instead of a bath and the room in the higher floor but in reception they said that they fully booked even though you can tell that they wasn t The room was small without any windows and any balcony so it always was lack of fresh air and the thing that you cannot see what s the temperature and the weather outside that was really annoying Also room insulation was terrible You could hear everyone and everywhere and as it was February 14 you can imagine what sounds you could hear clearly going from your neighbors that was so disgusting All in all the money that you pay for the stay is only worth for the place that is in the city center , The breakfast and the place is really good to stay around the center Main Ramblas street is in two minutes walk 
439938,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Small rooms We booked a queen and it was two twins pushed together with separate bedding on each twin , Staff was very friendly The hotel is in a great location super convenient to restaurants and sights The rooms are small but have high quality bathrooms and finishes There are great amenities on sight such as a restaurant and lounge 
439939,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Nothing I can think of , I thought the overall ambience of the hotel was amazing the staff were really helpful the location was perfect and the bedroom was very comfortable I ll definitely stay there again 
439940,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The heating system was a bit off so we had to call down to the front desk Would have been nice to be able to control the heating from the room , Really liked the service and breakfast The rooms were comfy and the size was good for two people 
439941,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, the bathroom was poorely designed so when u took a shower all the water spilled over breakfast was not worth the money you can get much better for a lower price outside of the hotel the room was noisy you could hear everything that was going on outside of the room like people talking or walking around , location was great staff was very nice the room looks nice very clean

439993,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The hot water tap on the basin kept turning itself off We didn t know if it was an eco thing but it was a real nuisance as you had to hold it on with one hand which made everything very awkward , Fantastic location just off Las Ramblas Modern decor and air con Welcoming and enthusiastic staff Good breakfast 
439994,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Our room wasn t ready at time stated Told to have a complementary drink in bar and we would be called in half an hour One hour and a half later we had to go down to reception to find out it was ready This was the only negative Everything else was excellent , Decor was beautiful Roof top pool and bar fabulous Received complementary water and juice every day and a welcome cake on arrival Excellant location just off la ramblas

440002,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Slightly larger lavatory in the room for long legs , Charming helpful staff interesting building a former nunnery good gothic features modernist conversion adds improved facilities 
440003,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Reception staff weren t that welcoming which was a shame and the issues we had with 2 lads sharing meant that we had to move rooms just to get a twin bed not the worst thing in the world One maid wasn t great as she was shouting in Spanish telling us something that we couldn t understand and then walked off in frustration and kept avoiding us when we saw her, Bar staff were amazing on the roof couldn t fault the service they provided Rooms were of a high standard and look exactly like the pictures Location is not even 2 minutes from las ramblas and about half way down las ramblas
440004,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The location is in the heart of the tourist area a very busy area if you want a more relaxed visit try their sister hotels away from the Ramblas , Comfy bed good rooms Central location

440008,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Hotel is very noisey due to the design sound travels echoes all around and at all hours Also housekeeping staff are prone to clattering outside your room quite early , Location decor cleanliness all great
440009,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, You just don t get what you pay for I ve stayed in much better hotels for half the price of this hotel My 5 night trip was in 4 figures and our room was so cramped you could barely walk around with ease Our twin room was two single beds pushed tightly beside one another Guaranteed to disturb one another if moving around at different times Not ideal , Hotel was spotless and friendly terrace was a big plus Great facilities 
440010,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, We had a two day booking but needed three days I requested this on day one They told me the third night wouldn t be a problem and they again confirmed this on the second day However when I arrived at reception on the third morning they told me they didn t have a room for me and I had to leave We had made no alternative arrangements and we found ourselves on the street with no where to go in a Barcalona which was full to bursting point The hotel staff had no concern and no consideration for our situation when I put it to them that they had twice assured me there would be room they just ignored me We ended up in a hotel 20 miles out of the city This event completely ruined our trip ,No Positive
440011,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, A bit pricey but comparable to other hotels of this type , The location is fabulous staff outstanding and service excellent This was my third time here and would go back in a heartbeat Beautiful facility 
440012,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Air conditioning was not that great and it wasn t super hot We could not have stayed in the top floor south facing boutique room with terrace in the hot weather as the a c would not be adequate , Great quiet location a very short distance from Las Ramblas Beautiful breakfast room and stunning dining room 
440013,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, You can easily hear the other rooms if there is any noise also I was staying the first floor and can hear when they have music in the reception very clearly in the room, The location is excellent the staff is very helpful
440014,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, They mixed up our booking and when we arrived they couldn t find our reservation and told us they were fully booked We were very panicked After some searching they found out that we d got a room but under another name A frustrating start to our break , We had a room around the atrium style area which was very impressive Rooms are very small but beautifully decorated in an artistic contemporary style Good location just off the Main Street and a stones throw from the main square 
440015,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The room was quite dark , The complimentary cupcakes and water were much appreciated The terrace bar was excellent to chill out away from the city bustle The room was a good size and I liked being able to open the window 
440016,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Nothing to dislike , Wonderful decor very friendly and helpful staff lovely clean and comfortable room amazingly quiet considering its proximity to La Ramblas delicious hot and cold buffet breakfast and a top notch laidback roof top terrace with small dip pool Fantastic 
440017,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The rooms were a little bit on the smaller side for the price but the room was well appointed which made up for this You also don t spend that much time in the room given the amount to see in the city , Hotel was beautifully decorated and rooms well appointed Free water and juice was appreciated after long days sightseeing and the roof top terrace bar with small swimming pool was good fun also
440018,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The ceiling of our bathroom began leaking one day we went out all day after telling the concierge in the morning about it When home around dinner there was just a ladder and half done work all over the bathroom must have been 1 of the 237 holidays in Europe with no work We went to dinner and asked if it would be finished or at least cleared out but when we got home around 1am or so no progress was made So we fortunately got another room but after some skepticism and eye rolling about how high and mighty we must have thought ourselves for needing a new room despite the workzone bathroom we at least we re moved , Location was excellent rooftop was nice and staff was helpful outside of the facilities issue
440019,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, We asked several times if we should book for the restaurant and were told no just come down when you are ready However when we did a very snotty man from the restaurant told us they were fully booked and ushered us away with no other advice So we went elsewhere The swimming pool is actually no more than a pond on the roof and there are no views from the bar terrace The bar downstairs was never open either , Tucked down a side street off Las Ramblas it couldn t be more convenient a location It was noisy all the time but the blackout blinds and windows did the job of letting you have a lie in We got breakfast in our room which was delicious 
440020,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Would have preferred little bit better view and space for the money Breakfast was not in the room rate and was quite expensive The next door neighbours had parties every night and the noise was quite disturbing, Location was close to La Rambla but on very dim and dark alley Very friendly staff Room was smaller than expected but very modern and clean Very comfortable beds and pillows
440021,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, Classic hotel with history A tour group with a docent explaining the atrium and architecture just outside the short hallway to our room Don t see that every day Two great things 1 the rooftop bar Friendly staff Great drinks Open late 2 literally a few feet from the Opera house Dress to the nines in 6 inch heels and walk to your seat without distress This stretch of Ramblas is a little sketchy but proximity to the Gotic is the key Perfectly situated 
440022,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Room was small and dark with a view into the atrium Neighborhood is mixed but close to Rambla, Beautiful building and well equipped room Great breakfast
440023,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, No balcony or window which made the bedroom a bit claustorphobic Also rooftop terrace had no outlook Only 3 English chanels to view on TV all news unless you wanted to pay , Beautiful hotel with lovely spacious rooms very comfortable beds Staff are friendly and willing to help with any queries Excellent location Positives outweighed the negatives 
440024,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Wi fi could be temperamental especially in the room , A smart modern hotel Couldn t be situated more centrally Good sized and clean room Excellent breakfast Friendly helpful staff Super architecture 
440025,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Nothing, Staffs are very friendly and helpful especially Jordi who help us with our luggage when checked in and Omar the one who helped us with the luggage when checked out 
440026,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, First room offered dark and very small no shelves for clothes no storage space However spoke to reception and they gave us another room which was much more comfortable for our stay Wouldn t normally complain but it was a special event trip , Staff were excellent great location Rooms kept very clean fresh towels everyday and clean sheets every two days 
440027,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, We had asked for a room with twin beds but the hotel seemed unaware of this and only a double bed was available They did offer to change our room the next day but we declined , Well appointed hotel with good transport links to the city Comfortable rooms in a lovely restored building 
440028,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, The staff were very welcoming and helpful We loved sitting on the rooftop terrace at the bar I really want some of that furniture Comfy bed Slept very well Perfectly positioned on the Ramblas for all areas and the trains 
440029,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The showers flooded the bathroom as top shower did not function well and the lower shower had to be used , The staff were extremely helpful booking entrance tickets for various sights and recommending restaurants 
440030,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, We stayed in the top floor with a spacy terrace which was very nice with the afternoon sun The staff were friendly and serviceminded The location was great with walking dinstance to everything 
440031,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, We were given the wrong rooms for the 1st night until I mentioned it It was all very designer ish which sometimes didn t mean comfort The sinks were too shallow the bed didn t leave much room to walk around in fact I cut my leg badly on the edge of the bed No mirror over the desk which meant either using the bathroom or the long mirror But saying all that we enjoyed our holiday , The roof top bar was a great place to meet and have a drink 
440032,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, The hotel is a hidden gem just off La Ramblas As soon as you walk in you are surrounded by luxury It is not cheap but you certainly get what you pay for and I would definitely stay here again The hotel the staff the service and the food at the Fonda restaurant and on the roof top terrace are exceptional
440033,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Bedside light didn t work on arrival and despite asking for it to be fixed it wasn t done during my four night stay, The roof top bar to relax after a days sightseeing
440034,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, No help at all fron staff with parking which is a nightmare Lots of noise early mornings will wake you Nasty cheap looking terrace bar , The restaurant is top class and worth a visit
440035,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Very noisy through the night, Lovely room clean bedding pool terrace was great barman was really lovely with fabulous customer service bathroom was very modern with great interiors
440036,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Double bed made up of two singles which when put together where uncomfortable as they appeared to part ways Loose toilet roll holder a minor thing but when we have paid a lot of money for our stay expected almost perfection Pool is really not worth mentioning in the hotel facilities very small Disappointed that having paid more and with breakfast we ended up with a small room on the first floor with no view when our friends had a large room view and balcony on fourth floor No tea or coffee making facilities in room and even though told free soft drinks in fridge it was only replenished once in four days and that was two small bottles of water and two small juice bottles , Staff were extremely lovely and polite especially the concierge in reception Lovely roof top bar with again fabulous staff 
440037,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, See bathroom comment above, Great friendly staff who spoke good English when my Spanish was lacking They suggested good restaurants and directed us to all the sites we wanted to see The room was adequate but bathroom shower stall needs attention There were traces of mold 
440038,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Woman next door clonking around with her stilettos marble floor , Room was lovely modern and comfortable Hotel decor is great and the staff extremely nice 
440039,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Pillows could have been better The entry was awkward as the key card to the room was behind the door, Position was great Staff were helpful and friendly
440040,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The room was not ready when we arrived They let us wait for two hours Second thing is that the bed was not very comfortable comparing with the amount of money we paid One of the staff the bald mature man not very tall was not very nice And he let us wait for two hours , Cleanless 
440041,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Apart from Antonio and the blonde lady at the reception I did not find the rest of the staff helpful or professional enough When I asked for slippers they told me that it is included only in luxurious rooms After paying 150 Euro for night I don t think this answer is appropriate , The location was lovely 
440042,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The rooms were a little small with limited furniture The Bathroom was limited by the design layout such as thin basins that allowed limited water in them The breakfast staff were overcome if more than a few people were present often creating a situation where people were waiting for food and drinks No views from the rooms or rather overlooking a cheaper environment, The site is convenient to the Ramblers and the staff were very friendly The architecture was different and seemed to overtake everything else The bar staff were excellent and the area enjoyable Very clean and inviting
440043,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Although it is located in mid of Rambla which is located in close proximity to shops caf s and nice restaurants However walking back to the hotel after 11 PM is not quite safe especially walking down the alley from the Rambla to the hotel Everything is satisfying about this hotel however I might not come back because of this point , Friendly staff Comfortable bed Cleanliness value for money Fast and wonderful Wifi
440044,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Didn t like the shape of the square sink Had to lean over far then you would normally to use it , The room was very comfortable Very tastefully decorated The whole hotel has been refurbished to a high standard without loosing the history of the building 
440045,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Room was a little on the small side and the free mini bar consisted of two bottles of water and two bottles of juice so a bit of a misrepresentation , Lovely hotel in the hub of the city 
440046,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Beds were hard Walls paper thin , The room with a terrace was fabulous The breakfast was delicious The pool looked brilliant Everything was spotless 
440047,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, less prostitutes in the street outside less chance of getting mugged outside more light in the room room 318 had no natural daylight what so ever , clean comfortable
440048,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, TV didn t work but really no time to watch it , Very helpful attentive responsive staff Excellent fast wifi Lots of hot water Good room cleaning Lovely building 
440049,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The air conditioning did not work meaning we had to open the window at night so it wasn t too hot Given the location this meant it was very noisy and we didn t sleep well There were also no tea coffee facilities in the room or iron For a 4star hotel at this price I would expect this as standard Also the roof top pool and bar was shut which was disappointing , Location Room decorations 
440050,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, I had aunts in room and bathroom on daily bases even after cleaning No hot water cattle I don t want the coffee packs just the kettle my major turn off os ventilation no ventilation or fresh air what so over in my room 418 i understand Europe hotels are tiny and u cant be lick enough to get a room with window but this ia unbearable or healthy i felt like losing my breath because of lack of oxygen , Thr location however there are like 40 other hotel in same area

440052,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, No requests acknowledged or given Breakfast paid for but charged and argued about every day Staff cool unfriendly and inefficient Room looked out at a wall , Historic building
440053,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, This hotel far exceeded our expectations the rooms were roomy the bathroom great the d cor was the icing on the cake and absolutely outstanding the breakfast had good variety and the staff were exemplary I found it hard to find anything wrong and we have had experiences all around the world of hotels I will DEFINATELY be back
440054,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, No tea or coffee facilities Cold breakfast and pastries were stale Very bad location of hotel as at night u could av got mugged , We had a Boutique Double very comfy bed Luxurious looking hotel
440055,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The street it is on is very shady One of the sinks in our room was broken No coffee in the room Very small room , The Hotel was beautiful Very close to las rambles 
440056,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Our only criticism was that the washbasin was very smart and ultra modern but too shallow to be of much practical use , The hotel is in an excellent location just off the Ramblas close to lots of shops bars and restaurants Beautiful hotel with spotlessly clean room and lovely d cor throughout Staff were very friendly helpful and efficient 
440057,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Rooms either look onto a covered internal courtyard or onto the street If you want some fresh air and a bit more light ask for a room overlooking the street but bear in mind it can be rather noisy at night , Friendly helpful staff fabulous location close to many of the main sights and a historic Modernista building that has been beautifully restored Breakfast is good too 
440058,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Our room is so dark it is ok for a good sleep but you know we miss Barcelona sun After bath a lake has occured in the bathroom due to solation problem I guess room 218 And climate system is not working so healthy, We love the position and design of the hotel And the team especialy Mr Omar is fantastic
440059,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Not the best value for money , The excellent location close to the Ramblas and metro station The friendly staff The design of the hotel Breakfast was very nice yet not spectacular 
440060,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Wash basin not practical long and shallow Glass door to toilet caught on tiles Would have liked a neck support pillow Would have liked a night light in bathroom, Quiet location close to La Rambla
440061,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Hotel was aware that the reservation was for 2 people and we had just one towel We stayed there 2 nights and this seemed to be an occurrence Also I asked ahead for the hotel to make any special arrangements possible as the point of this trip was for my boyfriends birthday Not one thing done or acknowledged Other hotels in the past this has never been an issue Hair in the bath when we first arrived which was very off putting topped with infestation of ants in bathroom and in room Staff wasn t very accomadatumg or hotel for that matter How it s a 4 is beyond me , The location was very handy In a popular area and tooled away off the most popular road in Barcelona 
440062,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The first time we stayed we had a room on the third floor which was great This time we had a room on floor 1 which looked onto a brick wall horrid if they put you on floor one check you aren t looking at a brick wall We were only there two nights and had stayed there before so didn t ask to change rooms , This hotel is in a great location in the centre of the Rambla but very quiet Taxis can reach it so no dropping of at La Rambla and making you find your own way 
440063,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The room was a standard one and we did ask for an upgrade when we got there but the hotel was full The view from room 112 was a brick wall But we were only in the room for showers and sleeping, The room was contemporary and perfectly adequate for a 3 night stay The bed was very comfortable The bathroom was very nice and had an excellent shower The staff were very helpful particularly the guy behind the bar 
440064,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The Internet in the room we had did not work we were told there was a problem on the 5th floor but next door and the corridor had wifi The pillows were awful and there was no spare ones The heating did not work and in the shower the water flooded The staff were friendly and gave us a free breakfast However at the price we paid these things should not happen We were told that the management would be writing to us and that was a month ago and we have heard nothing ,No Positive

440067,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The room faced the street and at night it can get noisy The sound isolatioon from the street should be better , Have been staying here several times and will come again Central location next to Rambla strong WiFi signal clean and very cosy Never seen a long line at the reception 
440068,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Occasionally had to wait a while to check in at breakfast Could hear some street noise voices but not a real problem as it was New Year after all Smokers congregated in front of bar window and could smell it from our table As the bar and view of the celebrated sculptor Eusebi Arnau fireplace are a feature of the hotel perhaps the smokers should be on other side of main doors only, Very helpful polite and friendly staff Room with balcony doors pedestrian street Good breakfast yummy omelettes ask waiter for these Enough for us as vegetarians with fresh fruit cereals cheese croissants and pastries Gorgeous orange juice Comfy bed Great shower room Felt relaxed and comfortable there 
440069,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, No easy road access for taxi when we arrived were dropped off around the corner and told to walk around the block First time in Spain so confusing and a little worrying at night , Very convenient to Las Ramblas and staff were very helpful and friendly Right next to the opera house and in easy walking distance of most sights Food was lovely and the decor special Specifically liked the alabaster fire place and the historic switch board in reception

440078,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, Hotel is in a fantastic building with very nice original features Location is just off las ramblas but despite the drinks are very reasonably priced and much cheaper than on the main strip Metro stop 2 min walk away and plaza catalunya 5 10 minute walk connecting you to transport to take to you places not in walking distance
440079,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The room is a bit cramped than I expected though mine got a terrace with street view , Good location so close to many main attractions especially only a couple of blocks away from the wonderful St Josep La Boqueria Very convenient The hotel itself is elegant and quiet too 
440080,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, The hotel was a bit dark but that s normal because of its location close to other buildings Also it was difficult trying to get to it with a car Otherwise the problem was worked out by putting our car in a garage about 5 minutes away on foot , Everyone was very helpful and friendly and the room was very comfortable We will definitely go back to this hotel next time we go to Barcelona Location was perfect as well 
440081,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Not recommended for those on a budget but the quality of service and facilities more than makes up for the price , Numerous landmarks are within walking distance The Hop On Hop Off bus stops red and blue routes and Aerobus stop are near as well The hotel showcases beautiful architecture so much so that it offers guided tours of its interior The staff are friendly and responsive to our needs 
440082,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, Noisy hotel There is a lot of internal noise generated from the atrium style and the placement of the function areas Overpriced for the quality of the rooms , Great location

440085,Hotel Espa a Ramblas,No Negative, A lovely quirky hotel the reception staff where very knowledgeable A most courteous welcome Perfect location for La Rambla close enough to walk explore and shop but quiet enough to miss the all noise as the hotel is situated in a side street with traffic restrictions We would highly recommend this hotel for a city visit to Barcelona

440087,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, We upgraded our room which was only just adequate so not sure what the original would have been like Upon checking out they ask us to pay again had already paid in advance Interestingly the bill they gave us was over 120 euros cheaper than we paid booking com and I thought we got a good deal , Staff excellent and friendly great location
440088,Hotel Espa a Ramblas, stale water smell in bathroom shower cubicle could have been smaller which would allow the toilet cubicle to be larger bedroom too modern for an old hotel , Hotel is old and has a nice comfortable feel to it Staff are excellent and the restaurant is superb
