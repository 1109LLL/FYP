269293,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The mattress too soft or maybe too used , The Nespresso machine in the room is a really great improvement I love and recommend Flo Brasserie the French restaurant downstairs

269299,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The shower wasn t very powerful the room had a stale sewage smell and the breakfast wasnt very appealing for the price Choice was limited as a buffet , Great location friendly staff The room 594 had a very large bathroom with a heated floor 
269300,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Small size of the room and twin beds You have to fill up and sign a form at the door to get your breakfast Never done this anywhere I will never stay again No mirror in the room , Location
269301,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The floor was obviously slanted and it was easy to stumble The floor also was bouncy and would move and make noise when you walked on it Carpet was soaking wet in front of bathroom and desk No instruction on how to use European coffee maker but it was nice that one was in the room Shower soap dispenser was empty , The room was spacious and comfortable Staff was friendly and helpful 
269302,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Arrived to check in and had to go away and come back 3 times before we could get in as room wasn t ready The receptionist disputed the fact if paid before arriving despite me showing 2 lots of proof and didn t apologise later that she had got it wrong Nowhere near enough milk or sugar for tea and coffee and powdered creamer Room was serviced once through whole trip so wet towels last night and sat and no tea or coffee left No robes and towels were tiny not big enough to be bath towels for adults , Location excellent

269305,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, What is with all the hotels in Amsterdam only supplying a comforter It was way too warm a flat sheet for the bed would be nice , The bathroom is really nice Most hotels I ve stayed in while in Amsterdam have tiny bathrooms with showers that seem made for children The full size tub was unexpected very nice It s also just barely off Rembrandt Square so it s right by one of the hubs of the city but significantly quieter than the hotels that directly overlook the square AC works well too which was also a nice surprise 
269306,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Please ensure if you need iron and ironing board you do request it prior to your check in as property runs out of those very quickly during a week , Great central location very knowledgeable and friendly staff Lovely bathrooms tea and coffee facilities and WiFi 
269307,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Absolutely hate the split beds Don t be fooled you get two twin beds when you book a large bed option The pillows are just as bad The whole bed in fact could probably be removed and make the room more comfortable , Location Location Location This hotel is in a great spot very near my place of work and with amazing access to public transit both tram and metro Rembrandt square does get pretty busy at night as well 
269308,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam,No Negative, Friendly staff Clean and comfortable Great location in terms of where I needed to be for the week Also lots of restaurants and things to do in the area 
269309,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The shower could not be turned off totally and the domestic staff had failed to report this My room was not serviced until about 3 30pm when I was tired after a morning sightseeing On my last morning the domestic staff knocked on the door and repeated the knock before I could get to answer it , Very comfortable room with window which opened and also aircon

269311,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The room was very noisy from the street and other rooms Air con in room not working Don t like glass door on bathroom Small room Extractor fan didn t work in bathroom , The food in the restaurant was good although they had run out of many things and didn t advise 
269312,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Bed was too soft The bathroom door can not be closed, Grate service Wonderful breakfast Lots of resturants and bars Very comfortable transportaion around Larg room
269313,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, See above, The apartment was in a great location overlooking the canals The only drawback was that we needed to negotiate steep stairs as there was no lift This was an issue as we were at the end of a 7 week holiday with lots of luggage Thankful that we were only on the first floor It would have been nice if we were aware of this from the beginning 
269314,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Would prefer to have iron and ironing board in the room than having to call for one, Great location to basically everything transportation shopping food museums tours canals
269315,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The bathroom The door is made of glass and very transparent so no privacy So it was a big Downer for me , The bed was very comfortable but the bed is actually two beds pushed together

269318,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Nothing to share loved all of it , The rooms were spotless and very comfortable The location was fabulous and the breakfast amazing The staff were friendly and polite 
269319,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, It would ve made top marks if there was more variety at the breakfast buffet as it became very repetitive at day 3 , The quality of food was good and the amount was always enough They allowed people to finish their breakfast and their own pace 
269320,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Check in time 15 00 is too late No slippers in the room Minibar is useless as a fridge because moved content is automatically added to hotel bill so there is not much space for your stuff , Location was very good 10 12 minutes by foot to Heineken Rijksmuseum and Dam Square During checkin and checkout there is a free concierge service Rooms were clean toiletteries replenished on a daily basis Breakfast was sufficient open buffet was a plus 
269321,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The breakfasts were not great and were not included as part of the deal Also a room that cost over 200 per night was extortionate in my view, The property was ideally located just off Rembrandt Square It was clean the staff were really helpful There was a restaurant coffee shop and bar on the premises which was great There was also lots of useful information about tourist attractions and tours 
269322,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Huge bathroom breakfast location value for money staff , Front desk clerk at check in was excellent breakfast was a nice treat location top Just some confusion as there is another hotel on town with the same name where we where dropped off by our taxi drive

269327,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, We were lucky enough to get an online flash sale deal on the rates but knowing the full price this hotel is not great value for money Cleanliness not up to standard and value towels had stains and dust on furniture Asked for 2 single beds got 1 large bed The hotel building and interior are mediocre and bland and considering the price the rooms and furniture should get a face lift , Breakfast was good but certain items were available some days and not others Staff was friendly and helpful but quite too formal which is not really in sync with the hotel itself Location very good 
269328,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, One of the lamp was broken in my bathroom which I asked to be changed but nothing happened during my stay , Central location perfect for few nights stay 
269329,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The curtains were hanging off the rail which I reported and it was not seen to The carpet was dirty and a couple of holes in the bed linen Although two in the room only one set of towels put out the second set had to be searched for One of the other rooms we had toilet paper was not supplied and had to be requested , The location
269330,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The room was tiny there was lots of dirt on the walls The window was broken so stuck slightly open permanently so I was woken constantly Room 372 is the room i was in They wouldnt let me check in till 3 even though id paid for the day Was at the hotel from 9am tired from travelling and had to wait 6 hours to enter my room which i was paying for The staff were really nice There is no way this hotel deserves 4 stars The actual hotel was nice and the bar was great The actual rooms were horrible though Location is superb, Location is great staff were brilliant Bar is amazing

269334,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, It was hard to get a good nights sleep because of the location I have stopped in a hotel on Rembrandt square twice before and have never had problems with sleeping but here I was woken up on the hour every hour by people outside and the trams The bed wasn t that comfy and there seemed to be a dip in the middle so I found myself rolling into the middle of the bed a lot Housekeeping were reluctant to fill up the toilet paper and we ran out of toilet paper twice There was only 1 soft pillow each on the bed I found another pillow in the wardrobe then the next day this had been removed from my bed by housekeeping On kings night our room was left open on the lock possibly by housekeeping as there was a housekeeping cart outside but no housekeeping members in site this was at 10 30pm at night so very odd We have no idea how long our room had been left open as reception told us they finished at 6pm so was a very weird situation Reception seemed shocked by this but didn t do much and just said they would pass our comments on to the housekeeping manager , The location was very good although our room was on the busy street with trams so getting a good nights sleep was impossible The bathroom was clean and the shower bath was a large size The staff were very friendly efficient and welcoming

269336,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The double bed was two singles pushed together found ourselves falling through the gap The bathroom was basically a glass cubicle can see and hear everything Be aware of the mini bar it is computerised and will charge if anything is moved Not comfortable for couples , the location was nice rooms clean and well presented friendly staff
269337,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The cleanliness of the room was not satisfactory Even day to day house keeping was not done to our satisfaction , The location was perfect and in the heart of Amsterdam Walking distance from all places of interest Located at the Rembrandt square which is a hive of activity and energy surrounded by super cafes and restaurants 
269338,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The single room bed was tiny and quite uncomfortable especially the one pillow provided The room didn t feel like a four star hotel and it smelled of nicotine although it was a non smoking room Windows could not be opened for some fresh air , Excellent location with access to public transportation which made the hotel very easy to reach from the airport or the train station Lots of choice for restaurants supermarkets and bars as well The breakfast was one of the best I ve had in a hotel and they even had traditional Dutch Easter bread for Easter The bathroom was really nice as well 
269339,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Shower temperature was a bit dodgy to adjust it was either hot or burning hot , Excellent breakfast buffet selection Friendly staff Prime location we walked everywhere Would definitely recommend Rooms are a decent size if you re just looking for a place to crash after a day of exploring

269342,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The room was bare and in need of refurbishment and the carpet was dirty The corridors had for trays and drinks outside rooms and in corners all day The walls were dirty and uncleaned We waited for 20mins to be served at check inland taken to a separate building where we had booked an apartment room The room was only accessed by the thinest of spiral stairs four floors up impossible to get your bags up to The apartment was over two floors and the toilet was on the lower floor meaning a dodgy trip downstairs to the bathroom in the night No where on the website was it mention the apartment was in another building and nowhere were the stairs no lift mentioned A very sad visit to the hotel even though we were moved to a different room and money of parking to compensate , the view was cool
269343,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, WiFi was very unstable and I had to disconnect and reconnect all the time , Excellent location at Rembrandtplein and close to Waterloo Metro Station Very helpful staff and comfy bed

269493,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The wifi could be improved Basically only fast enough to use messaging apps like whatsapp but you ll find it s too slow to stream videos You can get a code from the frontdesk to access their other wifi router but the access point seems to be buggy and sporadically disconnected me Overall you ll be too busy exploring the city to even worry about the wifi in the hotel , I loved the location of this hotel Basically right next to Rembrandtplein which offers access to restaurants bars and clubs but tucked away enough to mitigate the loud partiers tourist from the square at night The staff are great and rooms are clean and more spacious than most hotels in Amsterdam 
269494,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Free WiFi is terrible There was a long line to check out this process should be a lot faster , Stayed here many times now and the location is unbeatable Right next to Rembrandt square but because of double glazed windows and tick curtains still relatively quiet at night Rooms are of fresh design comfi mattress and spacious enough to sit as well 
269495,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, We booked an apartment which was spacious but in serious need of modernisation in comparison to hotel rooms , Good location not far anything friendly staff and spacious rooms 
269496,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Arrived late on Friday receptionist was very glum Guess it was late no problem , Great location all you need on your doorstep Also shower room excellent 
269497,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Safety and Security issues Someone opened the room door while we were sleeping at 1 am I don t know with what key All I know us I jumped out of bed and pulled the door open to hear running footsteps I called the receptionist who said he would investigate this imediately but he couldn t find anyone on my floor They obviously have a very poor surveillance system and could not get hold of that person , The location was great
269498,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Our room was a bit rundown and could use a paint job Also very poor design on the bedside tables with sharp corners , The location to places to eat and shop Hotel restaurant had good dessert 
269499,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, the hairdryer provided in the room week power and it heats up to quickly so that you need it to cool off because it automatically turns off once it gets too hot My advice for those who need a strong hairdryer is to ask at reception if they can provide you with one, Everyone I spoke to at reception was super nice and professional available at every moment and very friendly The room had every facility one would need and spacious also the bed was very comfortable I had it cleaned every day and the cleaning service was impeccable Location deserves 10 There s no place like Rembrandt square 
269500,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Found the gentleman on reception to be unfriendly Didn t feel that we received an appropriate welcome Advance Information relating to deposits was limited and as such I had to pay the deposit by cash and the gentleman didn t appear too pleased at this Although the hotel was adequate it didn t match its rating , Location
269501,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Internet on the 5th floor was poor Had to use the lobby to get a decent signal Shower pressure was low so couldn t use properly Unable to open windows for fresh air as on top floor so was reliant on the air conditioning security windows would be good here Breakfast is very expensive for what you get , Check in process is easy and staff are friendly 
269502,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam,No Negative, We needed a hotel for two nights as our flight was cancelled so couldn t be too fussy however this hotel was everything we needed The rooms were spacious the bed was comfortable and it was clean Perfect for what we needed 
269503,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The shower is sheer from the bed and the water after the shower flooded the bathroom and they didnt give us enough towels to dry it , The location is perfect Rigt in the center The staff is nice 
269504,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Noise from street at night Safe did not work and problem not sorted Breakfast was very noisy No clean cups in room for the following day Very expensive for what you got , Staff very polite
269505,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Upon arrival wasn t greeted very well by the receptionist I had requested ground floor was given the 5th floor Room never hoovered when I did not put DND sign cleanliness left alot to be desired asked for paper every night 4star not worth the money I spent My room facing a lecture room could not open the curtains it was like being in prison , I liked the location but thats about it 
269506,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Maids were nice most good but room usually not cleaned until 5 pm Tough if you wanted to rest before going out later , Overall the suite was a nice space We had a corner room with a view of the square Not as noisy as others reported due to multi paned Windows 
269507,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The glass doors for the bathroom didn t provide much privacy Also the double bed was 2 single beds pushed together but they were comfy all the same , Location was perfect Room was clean and comfy 
269508,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The beds a double is two singles pushed together The view we were looking at old office buildings The staff they were not very helpful The sheets had holes in the overall room was small and had poor lighting The room was not that clean There was not a full length mirror, Close to everything Spacious bathroom
269509,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Room was never cleaned only one day the bed was made, Great located Hotel upgraded to an executive sweat as I had told them it was a surprise trip for my husbands birthday When we was in the room for about 10 minutes a member of staff presented us with a bottle of complimentary champagne to say happy birthday 
269510,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Bath difficult to get out of without slipping Needs a mat for safety Nothing to hold onto Got the bruise on my thigh to prove it , Very quiet away from the street Comfy bed 
269511,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, I did not book an apartment but some how my booking has ended up as an apartment I simply don t know how Apartment was cleaned only the first day It was not cleaned nor towels changed for the next 3 nights I informed the reception 4 times The answer was we are sorry They promised to send clean towels within 10 minutes They never came The front office girl who took my complant should have followed up without just noting down Since this hotel is within walking distance from your office you should inspect it personally The stairs too steep narrow to carry heavy baggage I am 59 yrs old had sample baoxes that I bought for a trade fair Look at the bed There is hardly any room to get into the bed from the sides unless you get in from the front I always book thru you Look at my past booking history This stay was my worst travel experience I did not pay Euro 250 plus to stay at an apartment Bedside lamps bathroom mirror lights not working , Location is good
269512,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, the check in and check out time however staff is supportive in case guest arrives early before check in time , Inside room everything is worth value of money Breakfast was awesome and good combination of veg and non veg items in Amsterdam Liked the stay
269513,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Twin beds pushed together rather than double as requested Poor bedding Facilities like iron and board were available but only on request and often unavailable as on loan Late check in time 3pm Room was poorly lit , large room and bath Desk and comfy chair included 
269514,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The room was disgustingly small and to pay around 190 for one night was daylight robbery I certainly would not stay there again , Not much really The breakfast was good but not worth 18 5 Euros 
269515,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, the first night the receptionist was awful wouldnt give us another pillow or change our room wich was terribly noisy as it was facing the street next day we were able to switch rooms to a quiet and bigger one and get another pillow as the receptionist was a different person, copmfy bed clean centrally located 
269516,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam,No Negative, The location right on Rembrandt Sq and very near the tram line was fantastic The free Wifi and breakfast was good The rooms were decent although quite small and had twin beds instead of a double bed 
269517,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Air conditioning temperature No early checkin, Staff very helpful especially re extra bed for 13 year old which had got lost in booking process and when it came to paying they waived cost
269518,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Rooms were either not made up everyday or done very late when I had been out and come back to the hotel after a day out I had a coffee machine but the capsules were never replenished , Excellent location Close access to the tram and walking distance to most attractions Plenty of restaurants close by 
269519,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, rembrandtplein is an easy location very central though it s not the most charming area for someone visiting Amsterdam who hasn t been before, easy location
269520,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Pillows were terrible Lumpy hard and worn I told the staff about it and they said that is all they had Truly they need to get better pillows at their price point , Location was superb Staff was helpful 
269521,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Room quite cramped twin beds but only inches apart clear glass doors on the toilet shower not a good idea especially when sharing with a friend Room not always hoovered or toiletries replenished , Security was good
269522,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Not great value for money The hairdryer stopped working after a min so had to go to reception to pick up spare which was not in great condition either with wet hair I would have expected it to be bought to me Most of the outlets did not work or I could not get my adapter to fit in the holes Tv screen sticks out into the room it would be easy to colide with it Small step up into the bathroom which could be easily missed I had ordered a taxi for the next morning but when I checked it had not been ordered The conseage then ordered it for me then I am glad I checked , Good double glazing could not hear trams passing by or street noise Staff were friendly and pleasant 
269523,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Room service Room not cleaned or bed made on last but one day Had to call reception but still not cleaned completely , Large room with plenty of space 
269524,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Room was a bit on the small side but functional Not much wardrobe space for a long stay , Nice bathroom layout and good shower although I had to unblock the shower head properly first and a big comfy bed I didn t use any of the hotel facilities but what I did see of the place it was all quite clean and modern My room was side facing and on the top floor so quiet 
269525,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Pricing was unclear 5 city tax was hidden in the small print we also paid for what was advertised as 4 rooms they were not 4 rooms I kept getting locked out of my room They tried to overcharge as well ,No Positive
269526,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The reception was understaffed and very busy so consequently checking in was a very slow process Housekeeping of our room was a bit below par and they failed to replenish coffee tea making each night and forgot to refill the near empty toilet roll All were however remedied with a phone call , The hotel is very well positioned for central Amsterdam and the overall calibre of the place was very good 
269527,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Shower design needs attention water leaks out onto the floor However this is common in most hotel accommodation , The location was excellent The quietness of the room was fantastic I could not hear any outside noise or city traffic 
269528,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam,No Negative, We loved everthing view over canals The Apartment was amazing it had a balcony which was great as we both smoke Very clean and tidy Think the apartments had been refurbished as photos on tripadvisor and reviews was nothing like it The Apartment was just perfect 
269529,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Very slow wifi dirty bathroom and carpet in the room Booked a double but I got twin Asked to get it changed for 3 days but every day they said tomorrow , Nothing
269530,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Just actually 3 star hotel is advertised as 4 The price even with the 45 discount is too much for the 3 star hotel standard room Breakfast good again for 3 stars but at the price of the expensive hotels Fan in bathroom just a joke Too small bed for a double room with even short lienen on it original quality of the pillows and blanket up to a 2 start hotel in a word inapprorpiate ratio price vs value could be partly justified only by the location and supressed competition , Location standard services range
269531,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, I was pretty sure I selected early check in when I booked with Booking com I had to wait until 3pm for my room to be ready Wifi is very slow , The hotel is located right across from Rembrandt square Very clean comfortable room and bed Great restaurant downtairs
269532,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Maids were given till 5pm to clean our rooms so we were always back by then and didn t have our rooms cleaned the whole time, Bed was so comfortable Staff were really nice and helpful and always had a smile on their face 
269533,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The bed it was faulty couldn t sleep well all night They pushed two beds together 1 mattress was not straight so kept sliding down in the middle , Location
269534,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, At the front desk there was a bold tall guy he was very rude and to me and my friends and i think the reason is because we re arabs , I liked the location and the concierge we re always very helpful
269535,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Nothing really with hotel Amsterdam is an expensive city Normally museums art gallery s and churches are free to enter You had to pay into everything Even toilets in McDonald s charged , Beds comfy Staff friendly Located 1 min from busy square and tram stop Great location So easy to get from airport Train then tram 
269536,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Bedroom ventilation system Bathroom extract on all the time is noisy and balancing air conditioning was not easy , Superb location just 2 minutes from Rembrandtsplein and the tram system
269537,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The transparent bathroom door was a little bit odd but for us wasn t a problem A bit noisy from the street, Amazing location in the middle of the night life of Amsterdam and close to everything The staff was great and hold on to our luggage till our flight 
269538,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, reception is extremly slow check in and especially storing luggage My room was facing the street which streetcars passing etc and therefore quite loud , location quite central in amsterdam many bars restaurants and museums in walking distance
269539,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Breakfast expensive for what you receive and the staff was not able to clean the tables rapidly so many of people had to clean the table by themselves or wait for a clean table , Very good situation
269540,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Would have been nice to have breakfast included given the price , An excellent hotel in a great Amsterdam location easy to get to from the train station and an easy walk to most sites There is an excellent take away Mexican about 50m up the road from the front entrance delicious 
269541,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam,No Negative, The beds were very comfy The concierge was very helpful The location of the hotel is perfect for going to tourist attractions plus being able to relax in the sqaure

269543,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Nothing a good pleasant stay , On arrival room first given was not very good over looked back of hotel and was not a great deal of space After asking if it was possible to move we were given a room that over look the front Much better Good location for travel around Amsterdam and plenty of places to eat and drink 
269544,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The most disappointed hotel during my holidays The room was tiny and the curtain couldn t even close properly so the room is too bright to sleep Very tiny window with a dirty stuff outside Staffs weren t very friendly , In the city centre Have many restaurants and pubs around 
269545,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, New hotels like this tend to have a glass screen revealing the shower to the bedroom I get the idea for couples but it is kind of inappropriate for anyone else , Room was clean and beautifully designed
269546,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, There were a few minor issues with the room such as a leaking shower head and a broken tap Also the towels are a bit old being torn , Location is great Breakfast was also good with a very good selection in the buffet 
269547,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The room service menu was very limited , Staff were really lovely upgraded room to junior suite at no extra cost Fantastic location very comfortable bed 
269548,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Two single bed joined togather where It should be double or king size bed in junior suit as a couple it was very uncomfortable, Every thing location hotel room it s a good hotel
269549,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The staff at check out seemed rather disinterested in the job Instead of asking how was your stay the first thing she uttered was EUR 345 please card or cash Very impersonal and unsmiling After this she reluctantly said Have a nice day like a recorded voice mail messenger which was not needed after all that , I liked the location of the hotel and the general decor cleanliness of the property Also I was provided a special high speed internet connection other than the usual free wifi for no extra charge Much appreciated for the gesture 
269550,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, the pressure on the water in the showet it wasn t possible to wash hair The paint on the ceiling was falling of in the shower The cleaning was terrible The hotel wasn t serviceminded I ask for 1 2 an hour late check out only possible if I want to pay 50 and I had already paid 260 for a Night and this was 100 more than my College , The location
269551,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Bed sheet should have been larger it didn t cover the mattress , Good location friendly staff Helpful concierge allowed ticket purchase which avoided queues 
269552,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Strange having glass swing doors from bedroom to bathroom Separate loo gave a bit of privacy thankfully , Good sized room Warm and comfortable Under floor heating in bathroom was lovely and warm Friendly and helpful reception and concierge 
269553,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Cancellation policy very strict I booked 1 month before for 728 I checked 4 days before I was traveling same hotel 639 Plus I booked 5 nights had to leave after 3nights hotel said strictly no refund Good location but not worth the price ,No Positive
269554,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, For such a high standard hotel the wifi should be faster It was slow most of the times The breakfast is a little too pricey almost 18 if you book the room without breakfast included but I suppose that s normal , The hotel is an a fantastic location Very clean amazing rooms and loved the bathroom The shower was a waterfall shower which I absolutely love One of the nights I was there I ordered room service and the quality of the food was 5 star restaurant You can walk everywhere in Amsterdam from the hotel and it s right beside Rembrandt square Would highly recommend to anyone 
269555,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, I didn t like the fact that I booked an apartment and when I arrived it was like an old people home it was old fashion it wasn t in the hotel it was down the road the bed had cobwebs and there wasn t lighting and it was just very poor all over I do think also I got lied to when I was trying to check in as my flight arrived early at 8am they made us wait until 3pm on the sofa until we could check in They could improve this by perhaps offering early check in I m sure there are rooms available or even at a cost but it should become available because we wasn t the only ones, When I did complain about my apartment it did get resolved and I did get moved into another room which was done immediately which was good off the man working It is only about 10 minutes on the tram from dam square also so not far to all the good attractions
269556,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The bathroom doors glass panels that don t fully seal are a little awkward for friends , An excellent location for all the main attractions in the city Very close to a tran stop shop easy to get to Central station The room was large and comfortable 
269557,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, shabby poor decoration could do with an upstaurs toilet very steep stairs both to and inside it would be better value if there was a sofa bed in the living room, it was fairly central
269558,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Wish there were less stairs to get to the top apartment wish it was connected to the hotel rather than being in a building next to the hotel, I like the apartment the overall size of the apartment too
269559,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Housekeeping was dreadful had to find her in the hotel daily to ask for toilet roll and towels , Thw bed was so comfortable and the reception staff could not be more helpful and pleasant 
269560,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Thought it was closer to dam square than it actually was , Everything about this luxurious hotel was perfect couldn t fault it in anyway Im most definitely going back sometime soon 
269561,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The only bad thing I could say about the hotel is that the cleaners didn t even knock on the door they just opened the door which wasn t good when you were undressed The mini bar was automatic which meant as soon as you picked up a drink you automatically get charged , The location was amazing for the night life the room was exactly like it was advertised on booking com The rooms were spacious comfortable and clean The reception staff were very polite and friendly Would 100 stay here again 
269562,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Staff attuide is terrible Very rude And we stayed in a room overlooking the road and the noise was very bad went to complain And the staff looked down at Me and my wife Wifi not very good either, Location is good
269563,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Room wasn t cleaned properly, The very helpful staff member who assisted me with contacting my bank in Ireland in the early hours of Sunday morning following the theft of my money credit cards and mobile phone from my handbag within 24 hours of landing in Amsterdam the theft did not occur in the hotel but in a local bar I found all of the staff I encountered at the hotel to be very friendly and helpful
269564,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, I have scars from the glass door in the bathroom The door swings out the way and catches the top of your foot BEWARE Also on check out we were accused of drinking the beverages in the fridge when we didn t They have an automatic sensor so don t even touch them Room was smaller than the pictures but it was okay Television did not work The worst for us was the keycard for the lift 15 mins average time trying too open the lift It just would not accept the key cards A lot off improvements to be done in this hotel , Bed was like a dream requested a double and we got it Location is perfect not far from smokeys ice bar or Starbucks 
269565,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Dirty clothes left in the wardrobe in our room Also hearing was not working we had to get a blow heater The 2 single beds pushed together instead of a double bed , Loved the location Friendly staff
269566,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The glass wall into the bathroom was odd and made my aunt and father very uncomfortable My second room also had an odd odor and the comforters were a little small , Location was outstanding in the middle of everything and a tram a short walk away The staff were very helpful and polite 
269567,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, room was not properly cleaned the snack pringles were eaten and it only had one set of towels even tho we were in 2 people when trying to call reception after 10pm we got no answer so not super available staff, the location is good and staff is friendly
269568,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, the apartments are in diffrenet building which does not have an elevator so its very bad choice unless you want to carry your laggage to the second floor the made did not clean the room well, I liked the location and modern decoration of the room staff were helpful but not that friendly
269569,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, One lady who s name is dilta something Like that She was very unpolite and disrespectful Her attitude and bodylangage don t match with the meaning of her Work Hospitality and customers services We are very disappointed about this lady However 2 others staff were helpfull And professional , The location
269570,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Some of the cleaning could be better For example the toilet and the shower floor Also some big chairs in the lobby were dirty with big spots , Great breakfast with something for everyones taste Stylish room The location was perfect some minutes out of the worst tourist area 
269571,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Only negative thing would be no milk in room, Amazing location Very comfy bed Didn t have breakfast so can t comment but I m sure it was lovely Will be back soon

269574,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, I didn t like the thin walls Very poor sound proofing Could hear loud conversation from the next room could also hear the tv from the next room , I liked the location It was a twenty minute walk to a lot of tourist spots A lot of shops restaurants and banks nearby Tram stop about 100m away very convenient 
269575,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Room very small deceiving pictures on website Staff on arrival were helping other people who arrived after we did Not very helpful to us Tiny room looking out over a dirty roof full of cigarettes No milk in room for tea or coffee even after I REQUESTED SOME On checking out we were pushed for time and they kept us waiting ages for our bags out of the bag storage room and 8 other people , Great location Nothing else positive I can say 
269576,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, I asked for a full double bed and I was given two double beds pushed together Neither one of us were comfortable kept falling down the middle was waking up all night couldn t sleep When I went down to try and figure something out the mad who helped me was rude and said there wasn t anything he could do to assist my needs I traveled all the way from California and will never come back to your hotel nor will I recommend it , Bathrooms were nice and location was handy 
269577,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Double bed consisting of 2 separate matresses not what i d expected in a junior suite, Nice room at affordable price bathroom well fitted out Location perfect for getting anywhere in central dam 
269578,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, There was no natural light with only a tiny window into a courtyard There were stains on the headboard and a chair and there was no fitted sheet so the mattress was exposed Also the queen sized bed was simply two twin beds put together , The location was very central and convenient The room was spacious and the bathroom was modern 
269579,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The sheets were dirty the walls had black hand prints on the walls there was a spider web in the corner of the room , This property was extremely close to my office so the location could not be beat 
269580,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Our double bed was 2 twins pushed together there wasn t even a double topper to combine them so the beds would push apart during the night We also had 2 single duvets so we were practically in separate beds with only 1 small square pillow each Our cleaner did not clean thoroughly we only had a small bathroom bin and therefore had no where to put our rubbish which didn t get taken by the cleaner The magnifying mirror in the bathroom was also very grubby and on cupboard door hinges you could see thick dust On arrival we had 1 empty complimentary body lotion so obviously had not checked before our arrival During our stay we noticed people hanging around the entrance of the hotel until someone with a key card opened the hotel doors and they would then make use of our hotel facilities I feel that staff was limited we were often waiting at reception in a long queue during check in and out times also when we were picking up dropping off luggage at the holding rooms , The location was the best part of our stay
269581,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Tv no much programmes And for couple stay had 2 single beds should be double because the bed keep moving , Very good location very good response for the reception staff Spacious living room Nice balcony Very nice shower 
269582,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, We booked the junior executive room and requested a double bed but when we arrived in our room we realized the bed was in fact two single beds pushed together We went back to the reception and asked to change to a real double bed room and were told this was not possible We were also told that out of the 400 rooms in the hotel there were only about 20 with double beds No surprise that this was a common issue now that I read the reviews more carefully They could have made this clear on Booking com and shouldn t pretend that two single beds pushed together become a double bed , Convenient location right next to the Rembrandtplein Nice bathroom with big and comfy bathtub and floorwarming 
269583,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Too slow free internet access and paid alternative is no value for money Breakfast so crowded Saturday that it was hard to get some food Parking across the street costs 50 for one night Total unexpected additional costs 60 , Nice bedroom and bathroom Close to restaurants evening life 
269584,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Nothing , Fantastic location Close to the Christmas market and only a ten min walk to dam square We were able to walk to the central station also The staff were so lovely and helpful They gave us advice on where to go how to pay for it etc They were so friendly can t thank them enough Can honestly say that I can t say a bad word about this hotel Just so clean and lovely Definitely recommend 
269585,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The staff were very rude and unprefessional We booked a junior suit as we were on our honeymoon and when we arrived our room had two single beds we spent the first night of our honeymoon sharing two single beds at a cost of 250 for that night very cold rooms aswell asked for extra blankets on the second night and was told to ask someone else , The location and the facilities 
269586,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, inconsistent housekeeping rubbish left on the floor and cups left unwashed in toilet basin , excellent location with many restaurants or bars nearby

269589,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, not really bad but did like how the beds that were like twin beds just pushed together they actually separated during the 2nd night with a few inches separation in the morning Tub was so deep it was difficult for us senior citizens to get in and out of shower , concierge was super and so very helpful Front desk very nice
269590,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, The shower only had very cold water After requesting it to be fixed the next day it was either very cold or very hot Not exactly ideal , Great location and friendly staff 
269591,Hampshire Hotel Rembrandt Square Amsterdam, Requested an early check in due to our flight being very early in the morning Email confirmed but staff declined on the day and were very blunt unhelpful with this Other staff members were all pleasant Bed sheets were not cleaned once even though there was noticeable dirt marks , Location was very central Room was cosy and clean except the sheets not being changed
