421565,citizenM Amsterdam, The room temperature couldn t be set above 23 C , Huge window huge bed free movies including XXX Goes with the transparent shower and translucent toilet Everything you need on a short trip Quality products cosmetics furnishing Quick self check in and check out And lovely messages everywhere And eco friendly The best way I saw for reducing unnecessary towel cleaning the 10 euro cupon 
421566,citizenM Amsterdam, Rooms very small no option to make coffee tea in room concept of toilet shower in room not attactive not recommended for next stay TV not working via ipad, Bed was good central location near WTC nice bar
421567,citizenM Amsterdam, There could be a curtain between the shower and main door like there is between the shower and the bed when I was in the shower I was visible to people walking past when my husband opened the door The intimacy of having a toilet in the room is something that takes getting used to perhaps sound surrounding toilet for added privacy I missed having tea and coffee but understand why not available and was easy to have coffee downstairs in restaurant , I liked the quirky features such as the messages to guests the pictures and the artwork The staff were all helpful friendly and available throughout my stay Loved the ipad controlling the room Loved the really relevant and useful literature in the room which was invaluable in helping us find our way around Amsterdam and we took advantage of your restaurant recommendations thank you 
421568,citizenM Amsterdam, The only thing I didn t like was the size of the rooms Very clean and modern and bed very comfortable Shower great too , Nice atmosphere in a very contemporary hotel Very relaxing and nice bar area downstairs The staff were very happy and very helpful 
421569,citizenM Amsterdam, Could have offered free coffee tea as none in room staff a bit slow some people may not like the lack of privacy in bedroom , Friendly staff location room layout facilities voucher for not having room cleaned 
421570,citizenM Amsterdam, Finding the packaging of a used condom behind the bed from previous tenants of the room did not contribute too well to the impressions , This is a place you would remember as it is so different from everything else you tried It is very upbeat the room is fun with the transparent cylinders for shower and toilet plus the iPad smart room control Yes the room is small but it is cleverly designed so you will not bump into things all the time Breakfast is good public transport is really great 
421571,citizenM Amsterdam, Small room don t bring more that one piece luggage Shower and WC in the sleeping room is questionable , Huge bed great wifi connection a lot of space in common areas at ground level Excellent for one night is you are travelling alone and you need a confortable room to sleep Bar open 24 7 
421572,citizenM Amsterdam, If I was to nitpick the only thing I missed was being able to make a cup of tea in my room but that said the bar was a lovely area and I could easily buy a cup of delicious fresh ginger and lemon tea to take up The area is a little way out of the centre but once you ve got the hang of the tram system it s really not a problem at all and it is a nice peaceful neighbourhood , You have everything you need to a very luxuriant standard Really comfortable beds good perks like their eco warrior tokens where you gain 10 credit for not having your room made up every day the staff were super friendly and helpful The bar and lounge areas were very stylish and welcoming 
421573,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Bed was so comfy And huge Overall the room was pretty great Controlling it with an iPad was quite nifty Toilet and shower being in the room didn t faze us at all There s a curtain that can be drawn across that area if you re a bit shy Staff were really friendly helpful too Loved the whole concept of the place Brilliant literature and art all around you 24hr bar Clever incentive to help the environment Couldn t really recommend the place more Tram stop was just outside 1 tram ride to city centre but takes almost half an hour I think that s the only slight negative I can think of Just fantastic Will definitely be back 
421574,citizenM Amsterdam, Given voucher but voucher arrived after we had left for the day did not arrive back till early hours as had been away to football match but couldn t use voucher in morning , Kids enjoyed iPad control of lights and TV
421575,citizenM Amsterdam, location is slighty boring The toilets are not very private At some point our airco failed us a little , bed is big and really comfortable Staff is fantastic Breakfast was delicious Cable tv wifi and more facilities were outstanding we even stayed in a whole day Room is quiet Walking distance to the tram Great lobby with good bar and amazing they have computers printers and so much more to your service 
421576,citizenM Amsterdam, The room is very small Not recommended more than one person to accommodate as there is no space to move at the same time There is no separate bathroom one cabinet for toilet and another one for shower There is no minibar no wardrobe no openable windows , Cozy and hi tech Staff is super nice Bikes and movies are for free Good for short stay for single travelers 
421577,citizenM Amsterdam, The short story there was literally NOTHING that I did not like The long story Upon arrival in that dark and rather scary entrance I thought Oh my God where the bleeps did I get myself a room this time And then OK ZENNNNNN take a deep breath you ll survive I got a few more moments like that like when getting this flashy youngster guiding me to the computer to check myself in and when arriving in this endless red carpeted hallway with white walls and same colour doors every three meters reminding me of a super funky futuristic version of a psychiatric ward then upon entering my room with flying saucer like coloured lighting over the toilet and shower and this huge TV screen over the bed saying Welcome citizen Martine But every detail I was taken aback by turned out to be actually quite agreeable I even slept like a baby which doesn t happen in many hotels I can tell you that much Waking up with the trees hanging over my window helped And then the cosy every little corner looks different but it all feels like home ground floor where you can chose a different spot every day to have breakfast , They have the greatest cereal mixes including one for gluten free people AND they have soy milk when you ask for it They have REAL bread that you can slice yourself and REAL jam and berries All the simple good things and something for everyone s taste Surprising how a simple hotel like this can do that whereas the fancy hotels can barely get you a slice of totally tasteless gluten free bread let alone milk powder free and never mind a decent gluten free cereal mix or milk other than cow s Plus one asks for a ristretto the one shot italian one and one actually gets a real one for the other pluses see the section What you didn t like 
421578,citizenM Amsterdam, The bath and shower in the middle of the bedroom floor is something to get used to Limited space to pack your toiletries , Staff were very friendly Breakfast is lovely but the same everyday Bed is very comfortable
421579,citizenM Amsterdam, No stamps to post my postcards , The staff excelled The ambiance was awesome and I loved being apart of this quirky little hotel I feel that I belong 
421580,citizenM Amsterdam, Construction works at the front of the hotel were noisy on our last night, Great staff good location huge comfortable bed powerful shower great choice of movies free bike hire tram tickets sold here quick and easy self service check in
421581,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and welcoming and there was just a very nice atmosphere in the hotel The rooms were very funky and different to any other hotel rooms we ve stayed in before 
421582,citizenM Amsterdam, In the weekend Amsterdam Zuid South is empty as it is a business location in terms of bars and restaurants at the South side , Close to the businesses in Amsterdam Zuid South and still easy to go walk to some good restaurants in the city 
421583,citizenM Amsterdam, Some high tech features are already failing The motors for the blinds are louder than most Dutch trains The shower which should only work when shower door is closed kept leaking periodically through the night , The modern design and high tech room features Very quiet area yet very close to major train station and business park 
421584,citizenM Amsterdam, If you are hoping for a hotel with a view this is not for you Industrial surroundings A lot of construction work going on at the moment aswell Rooms were great on the whole however quite compact between shower and toilet basin , Beds super comfy Staff were very friendly Hotel very easy to reach from the airport Metro trams trains and buses all within a 5minute walk 
421585,citizenM Amsterdam, Quirky tiny rooms No privacy with bathrooms Good for single occupancy but definitely wouldn t recommend to any couples or family The shower head was dripping had to put a towel underneath to dampen the sound , Hi tech rooms with controls using iPad Close to the metro 
421586,citizenM Amsterdam, Ideally there could be a gym on site however that wasn t essential given great weather at the time and proximity to the park , I really enjoyed the hotel I thought that the size of room amenities and breakfast were all ideal for my needs 
421587,citizenM Amsterdam, The AC was not working effectively Rooms are very narrow spaced and would not suit claustrophobic people Positioning of shower and toilet are best for intimate couples , This is a concept hotel with a smart room I enjoyed the mood pad with which you can change the color of the shower lights Kept clean Bed was comfortable 
421588,citizenM Amsterdam, TV had a line through it Shower was a little tricky to work but was good once you got it going , Very easy to get to and from the airport one stop on the train easy to get into the city tram stop right outside Could buy day passes down at the bar coffee was really good Breakfast was a bit pricey but worth it Rooms are big enough bed is big and comfy lots of free movies on the TV s Staff were nice 
421589,citizenM Amsterdam, There was no toothpaste Drops of water falled suddenly in shower during 5 10 minutes and we walked up in the middle of the night Probably it is problem with plumbing room 510 , Very comfortable smart House system Nice bed
421590,citizenM Amsterdam, No long mirror in the room so you had to check your outfit in the hall haha , Bed comfy staff were AMAZING very helpful friendly Set up everything for my boyfriends birthday balloons in eh room ect Treated us like Royalty
421591,citizenM Amsterdam, Perhaps a shelf or two to unpack but we made use of the drawer under the bed , The friendliest hotel staff I have ever come across Super comfy bed Free movies Modern hotel with quick self service check in and out and an iPad controlled room Easy to get to from the airport and with the number 5 team right outside its easy to get into the city centre and around We had a great stay there 
421592,citizenM Amsterdam, Our iPad didn t work whole of 2 days but luckily we are savvy to work the blinds lights and tv manually , Friendly staff comfortable probably a bit far out from the centre however it s right next to the station and a tram stop so you can be there in 15 mins hire a bike or a couple days travel pass definitely worth it Rooms are nice lovely bed and shower 
421593,citizenM Amsterdam, MMORAL Hotel is diffrent Designe and diffrent than others but for family its not good so many bad tv program and picture at hotel i really dont like it Just my idea , Breakfast was ok trum just 1 min Far from hotel Stuff not just Friendly they already friend they dont let you feeling alone They deserve best hotel stuff Award thanks MR Ben English Boy Raymond and Friday and a k Worker
421594,citizenM Amsterdam, I am glad I stayed alone as there is not much privacy in the bathroom toilet If you drop a stinker it will be smelled all over the room , Super modern hotel with all the new modern amenities iPad to control your room lightning curtains TV alarm Great common area Bar is open 24 hours Cool setup
421595,citizenM Amsterdam, a place to put down my luggage, super friendly staff making you feel at home Lovely communication tone and great room and lounge interiors comfy bed
421596,citizenM Amsterdam, Small room size, Unique Hotel with friendly helpful always smiling staff Online check in within minutes Nice location 5 minutes walk from the Train station Tram stop just next to the Hotel Comfy beds Room has these mini Ipad that controls room lightings TV etc Good breakfast spread 
421597,citizenM Amsterdam, Only a minor point although rooms have everything you need and very clean the toilet and shower physically in the middle of the room was a little off putting Its okay if you have a close relationship with someone you sharing but going the toilet behind a tinted glass cubicle or having a shower you can still see Room had everything you needed was clean just narrow and although air con very good I like to open a window , Hotel very clean staff helpful and ultra modern with everything you need room compact with digital facilities to open blinds change mood lighting air con bed very big and comfy You can get your tram tickets at hotel 17euro for 3 day pass Hotel in a good location just round the corner from Amsterdam Zeud main train station direct in 1 minutes from Airport Just round the corner is the tram stop for No 5 takes you through all the main tourist spots to Central Station no longer than 10 mins 
421598,citizenM Amsterdam, There isn t anything I didn t like , I loved everything about the property Such wonderful helpful friendly staff one of the most cool places I ve ever stayed Loved it cant wait to book again 
421599,citizenM Amsterdam, We got an eco warrior discount card to spend in the canteen but you could only spend it on your first day It gets placed in your room at 5pm and we were out until 10pm and wanted to use it the next morning but we couldn t very strange and poor service, Comfy bed and pillows 
421600,citizenM Amsterdam, While we particularly loved the room setup and it was clearly reflected in the room description pics having the shower and toilet in the room might no be for everyone so make sure you are aware of the setup before booking , Lovely concept fresh modern and interesting The hotel is very close to the train station as well as to the tram station making it easy to get to all the city s attractions Nice rich breakfast Staff extremely helpful and kind Loved how they encourage being eco by giving away vouchers for the bar in case you don t need to have the room cleaned 
421601,citizenM Amsterdam, I checked in at about 11pm after a long day of traveling and work When I first entered the room I realized it was too cold and switched on the heating At two pm I woke up due to the cold temperature and called reception and asked them to help They said to keep waiting as the temperature could go up I called again 45 minutes later and they offered a blanket and hot tea as the hotel was fully booked and they knew the room was cold I told them that I expected to get a reimbursement as the night I had paid for was a decent night of sleep in a four star hotel and citizen m was not being fair The guy replied that I could get the blanket and tea and he could not do more and said it was unfair that I was asking for a reimbursement to have a free night by justifying it with the fact that heating was not working Horrible , The concept of the hotel is a brilliant one smart rooms easy check in and check out 24h bar 
421602,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing, Location is perfect almost next to train station Amsterdam South Rooms are as clean and comfortable as in all Citizen M hotels I love their concept Staff is great somehow they notice everything and offer help and service at the right moment Very polite and with humor Breakfast was perfect and more than sufficient Fresh fruit different kinds of bread yoghurt eggs bacon cheese and meat etc 
421603,citizenM Amsterdam, Maybe its just me but to have an extra charge for paying with a credit card is always annoying , Friendly Staff excellent facilities and comforts to enjoy your stay
421604,citizenM Amsterdam, I found the breakfast slightly expensive for the variety available but it was not that bad , Very different and modern hotel Gives that Amsterdam feel The lights TV curtains etc can be controlled via iPad which I found very cool There were also Mood lights in the room The bed was nice and comfy The positioning of the shower and toilet in the room is a little weird but the shower was really really good The location is also good There is a tram stop right next to the hotel from where you could reach the city center in 15 20mins The airport is also very easily reachable via train 
421605,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, very cool room design and public space design Loved the connectivity of the rooms and the media they offer a whole palate of Netflix style media to stream for free very much a hotel for the 21st century Common areas also have a great concept for relaxing networking or working I did all three there 
421606,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff was incredible here My wife came in panicked because the other reservation was fraudulent The staff noticed she was crying and stressed and gave her a cup of ginger tea for her nerves A cozy place close to public transportation 
421607,citizenM Amsterdam, The shower cab and the toilet are in the middle of the room Though separated by sliding doors it is an awkward feeling if you are sharing the room with someone , Modern neat and clean The stuff was very cooperative and friendly Hi tech highlights in the room e g different room lights for different mood 
421608,citizenM Amsterdam, Expensive breakfast checking in was a bit of a nightmare We went to prepay but we booked through booking com which said don t prepay Then we showed up the day of and tried to pay cash which wasn t accepted , 24 hour bar was great And very relaxed main area
421609,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Everything about the Hotel was excellent from the staff to the drinks breakfast and comfort of rooms The location was only 5 mins from the train station and 2 mins from the tram stops Fabulous place 
421610,citizenM Amsterdam, Very inconvenient location 30 min ride by tram metro bus from the city center So if you enjoy commuting that s an option Very small rooms in the picture they seem bigger very minimalistic style of the rooms not enough room to place your staff clothes no fridge the toilet and shower in the middle of the room eventually appeared to be inconvenient at all and the idea of it resembles a cattle barn It s not worth the money they ask for this place at all In the city center there are better options for lower prices with breakfast included Could have had better time in Amsterdam if the location was better , The bed is huge and comfortable good range of movies if that s what you are looking for when you travel 
421611,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, The culture of the staff They couldn t do enough for you and go over and above that extra mile Esp BEN And the lady at breakfast who got me a bowl of cereal from the back because I had missed breakfast Just amazing Would highly recommend it 
421612,citizenM Amsterdam, Parking outside is very expensive A bit a pity that most staff do not speak the language of the country itself i e Dutch in Netherlands , Different concept Rooms are small but very well organized The staff is very friendly 
421613,citizenM Amsterdam, I couldn t say there was anything that I didn t like , Amazing Hotel 30 Taxi ride from the Airport Greeted as soon as we walked in the door helped with check in We was in our room within 2 minutes could not have wished for a better room for the money Clean Mood Lighting Open Shower Large TV free water daily The bar staff especially Ben were very friendly helpful Staff helped with ordering food ordering airport taxi knowledge of Amsterdam The location was great outside all the hustle bustle but just a 10 15 minute tram to all restaurants red light district shopping etc We purchased a Tram ticket for 3 days 12 each from the hotel which is well worth it as we was constantly using the trams Central Line number 5 got us everywhere we needed to be 
421614,citizenM Amsterdam, Can t think of anything, This ultra modern hotel very different room layout to most hotels Wifi is excellent staff are friendly chatty helpful Hotel is near tram stop tram 5 goes straight into dam square central station and museums Station is close by and is only one stop from airport So when landing take train 6 minutes to Zuid station and say 5 to 10 minute walk to CitizenM
421615,citizenM Amsterdam, The photos made the rooms seem bigger then what they are There are small things that could easily make the space more comfortable , The modern feel and 24 hour service availability The entire hotel has a quirky feel 
421616,citizenM Amsterdam, Just the size of the room although loved the modern layout Bed huge and very very comfy, The hotel very quirky Lots of leisure areain main foyer Room also very modern and quirky but with two large suitcases abit squeezy for our five night stay Staff wonderful Very helpful and friendly Booking in and out very easy and quick Great location 15 mins from city centre on No 5 tram Which goes straight past the museum area
421617,citizenM Amsterdam, Only negative point I have is it would be perfect if the room had a small fridge and ironing board, Great stuff nice rooms and set up everything positive about the hotel
421618,citizenM Amsterdam, we had breakfast at the hotel on our last day which was very disappointing and a little expensive Not worth the money you pay Walk down the road and there are much options, Loved the location Tram stop literally outside the property and about a 10 minute ride to Dam square Loved the facilities Great overall
421619,citizenM Amsterdam, Bit of a mission to get into the city centre but nothing extreme , Rooms are funky and more then adequate for visiting the city Found different parts of the city never discovered before being slightly outside 
421620,citizenM Amsterdam, I liked everything there s nothing to complain about , One of the best hotels in Amsterdam that I stayed at A bit far from the center but there s a tram stop nearby also easy to walk to the center passing by channels and nice places Will definitely come again Very friendly staff perfect rooms magic cocktails at the bar 
421621,citizenM Amsterdam, During the night the shower starts dripping and becomes noisy , The hotel is really modern and inovative Close to public transport Good food options at the restaurant take away 
421622,citizenM Amsterdam, Well just one complain that I was charged incorrectly from the breakfast cost If I didn t see it then I have to pay unnecessary cost I ve already paid for the breakfast for 2 morning with a girl by my card on the check in day But the other just thought that I eat without paying so they charge me more That pissed me abit lol, This is a good place to stay Very modern in designs and make you recharge yourself well It s quite expensive for my budget trip but compare to the other hotel in Ams this is a proper place for me It s close to Zuid station just 5 minutes walk if you don t get lost There is a TRAM stop like 20 meters from the hotel so it s another direct way to get into the city The bed is soooo big and comfy I don t want to get up 
421623,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing, This hotel is great I highly recommend it I stayed here with my boyfriend for five days and felt at home Everything was perfect thanks to the location and the kindness of the staff The location of the hotel is great attached to Zuid train station and twenty minutes walk to downtown the rooms are sensational futuristic super comfortable if i would go back to amaterdam i will definitely stay here again Thanks to citizenM the hotel that speaks and gives joys An amazing stay 
421624,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Loved the Concept the location and the Staff The rooms are very space age with their pods and mood lighting The bed was extremely comfortable and the amenities were great The common areas full of design pieces and the brand image is amazing Only 15 minutes away by train to Schipol Airport and 10 m tram into Centrum Friendly Staff with great city advice Would come back again and again Cheers M
421625,citizenM Amsterdam, this is my second stay i still haven t gotten use to the room size and layout having the toilet and shower in the middle of the room isn t for me however i was staying alone so it really wasn t that uncomfortable but it is like staying in a closet ,No Positive
421626,citizenM Amsterdam, Rooms were too small albeit very well designed for a compact space , Overall an excellent super modern budget hotel experience the brand and concept is excellently put together from marketing collateral to staff through to technology Marriott seem to have copied the concept with Moxy but Citizen M seems more streamlined and better executed 
421627,citizenM Amsterdam, I wish we could have brought a cot in for my daughter as we had a very early departure for the airport it would have been nice if she could have slept over, nice bed clean nice shower
421628,citizenM Amsterdam, Not much maybe not coffee tea in the room, the new concept of the room design distribution and connectivity Being able to setting the mood colours music and movies available The big bed different idea for the toilet and shower including lights inside The Restaurant coffee was really good Very nice friendly staff
421629,citizenM Amsterdam, The rooms are on the small side and although the shower and toilet cylinders may be way funky they get in the way The rooms are perfect for a single but as a couple our 3 night stay was at the limit , The location had excellent access to train and tram making all of Amsterdam at your doorstep The price is right The dining bar lounge area is very cool although not intimate it does have a great selection of quick bites and solid bar choices 
421630,citizenM Amsterdam, I wasn t thrilled about the toilet in the room with just a smoked glass enclosure I would prefer a little more privacy If you re sharing the room with someone you need to be in a comfortable point in your relationship , The staff are terrific friendly and helpful The bed is big and incredibly comfortable The room is on the small side but it s designed in such a way that we never felt like we were cramped The breakfast was a respectable buffet that s a little on the pricey side but convenient and tasty The shower was very nice Having a tram stop just down the block made it very easy to get to the places we wanted to go 
421631,citizenM Amsterdam, The toilet facilities are far to lose for comfort Privacy is needed at times when using the toilet , The bed was extremely comfortable The films were a great addition 
421632,citizenM Amsterdam, What I did not like is the bathroom The room is small and there is no separate bathroom The wc toilet is separated from the room with an opening closable glass Another bad thing is the price very high but I must admit a very good service , I liked staff very kind The position is very comfortable Near the hotel there is a tram stop They offer FREE bikes but you have to remember to order it the day before We forgot to do it and all bikes were already rent Highly recommended for 2 3 days in amsterdam
421633,citizenM Amsterdam, They have a free bike rental They probably need some more bikes because they are running out pretty quickly in the morning The voucher for the eco warrior should be valid for the length of the stay and not only the same day , extremely friendly staff nice room features Loved the eco warrior option They don t clean the room and you get a voucher for food or drinks in the outlet 
421634,citizenM Amsterdam, There is nothing that I would change , Amazing hotel great location right by the 5 tram to take you into dam central The huge bed was so comfortable and excellent to come back to after a night out in the city The staff were also very friendly helpful Great value for money 
421635,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Incredible staff We woke up late and missed general dinner eating time and the staff offered us a free warm meal I never received better customer service anywhere Thank you 
421636,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing, rooms are small quirky hi tech and stylish and are ideal for a single or a couple to stay The decor on the ground floor is modern yet very cozy The staff are friendly and knowledgable 
421637,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing was all great , Great place to stay particularly as attending a conference which was within walking distance Super friendly staff super clean and super comfy 
421638,citizenM Amsterdam, Location is convenient with easy transportation to city center but it is far Takes about 30 min by tram or subway I found breakfast cost too high 15 day person The toilet in the middle of the room is cool but is not for everyone Some couples might feel a little uncomfortable so only recommend for open minded couples , Hotel is awesome Beautiful decoration friendly staff very comfortable bed All the technology at the bedroom is really cool and the variety of movies available is great Also had dinner one night and food was very good 
421639,citizenM Amsterdam, It was quite expensive for the size of the room, Love how convenient and close to the metro it was as well as how lovely the rooms were Clean and compact 
421640,citizenM Amsterdam, Would have liked coffee and tea in room More places to unpack very small hanging area right near door and draw to store luggage but then nowhere to put clothes , Very quirky Interesting concept Rooms extremely small all the same size Couples with suitcases and over 130 lb in weight took one look at the rooms and left The rooms are only suitable for smaller framed people single travellers with small luggage Nowhere really to unpack properly toilet and shower are in wrap around glass cylinders very small Room moods TV lights etc are all run from an iPad No coffee tea etc in rooms Not a place for the older traveller and for someone not savvy with this type of thing Rooms are like space pods I an 65 computer savvy was alone in the room so great for me staff are extremely helpful 
421641,citizenM Amsterdam, The room felt really cramped had to go by the door in order to be able to have room to dress properly so both of us weren t bumping into each other Also no coffee facility , The bed was really comfortable The staff are really friendly and the hotel was spotless 
421642,citizenM Amsterdam, Not enough pillows no fridge to store food only one mirror in the whole room , The iPad which allows you to customise your room free movies friendly staff
421643,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, CitizenM was clean comfy quiet and great value it s in a nice area too and just a 5 minutes tram ride to the city centre and one train stop from the airport We had such an amazing time in Amsterdam and hotel really added to it 
421644,citizenM Amsterdam, Broken shower head with way too hot water coming out We were immediately directed to a new room on the same floor so they definitely responded quickly to our needs , Great concept quiet location and vouchers to be used in their canteen if you go green and request for no room cleaning
421645,citizenM Amsterdam, The hotel isn t in the city center which is okay it doesn t have a gym on site okay and the food is simple all of this should be reflected in room price which I d say is 15 high, Very welcoming staff not standing behind a desk patient and informative room had rain shower with lights quiet room and bed good size no kick board great room could be doing with a fridge for hot summer nights getting to airport is seven mins by train the bus takes long time and you need to change and still walk tram to cc is like 2 min walk and ten mins on tram buy a tram card at hotel its cheaper than buying at airport hotel had left luggage but charges 30 euros for late checkout ie after 11am be gone or pay up
421646,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, The hotel was awesome the staff helped us to check in gave us tips for the city If you re a eco friendly guest they give you a 10 check to spend at the bar it was a surprise birthday present for my boyfriend and we loved it best choice ever 
421647,citizenM Amsterdam, Enjoyed it all , We were made very welcome by young enthusiastic staff Breakfast was wonderful good variety and fresh Loved the experience Thank you 
421648,citizenM Amsterdam, The shower toilet situation was a bit awkward If you re sharing a room be sure that you re very comfortable with whoever you re sharing with , The bed was amazing And I loved that they let you use bikes for free The room itself was kind of fun The lobby area is huge with lots of different spaces to work or relax
421649,citizenM Amsterdam, Well if you book double room make sure you stay there with someone who is really close for you Because toilet and shower are literally inside the room and you can see and hear everything that happens there as the doors are transparent , The hotel is very unusual and fully supports the general atmosphere of the city Super comfortable bed Great breakfast 
421650,citizenM Amsterdam, The room was great and clean but I believe best for only one person Two people with normal size luggage could not fit both in the drawer so one had to be on the floor That made it difficult to walk around Also privacy issues with using shower and toilet Did like using the laptop for all features in the room Good access to public transportation to get to town , Friendly staff and always willing to answer questions Enjoyed having computers for guests so they can make local reservations and print them 
421651,citizenM Amsterdam, Rooms much to small The toilet is in a pod in the room which was really not private also the shower is in a pod It reminded me of a hostel for adults the room price is too high for what is offered , Location and access to public transport was great 
421652,citizenM Amsterdam, Breakfast and bar far to expensive Clearly catering for the business traveller with expenses , Comfy bed Good towels I like modern style of citizen M Rooms are small but you know what your getting so it s fine Really good shower 
421653,citizenM Amsterdam, The shower really should have privacy glass round it like the toilet does as the privacy curtain is quite sheer and thin , The bed was huge and comfy The tv with ipad control and apple tv streaming was good The 10 discount for not having your room cleaned which can be spent at the bar canteen is a good idea The staff were all really nice and friendly 
421654,citizenM Amsterdam, Bed although very big difficult to access for couple had to crawl over partner The layout was good except when using the full length vanity unit made moving around the room difficult, Location close to train station metro very clean good facilities great internet free safe free movies
421655,citizenM Amsterdam, Price not so cheap , Wonderful unique hotel concept Convenient location easy to each by car from the motorway easy to go to the center by tram 5 
421656,citizenM Amsterdam, Due to the quirky layout of the room it was difficult when we were packing unpacking, The staff were all super friendly and helpful we had a problem with our shower and it was resolved within minutes
421657,citizenM Amsterdam, Rooms are tiny Even for a citizenM Local area hasn t got much going for it though is pleasant enough No trouble getting the tram though from right outside the hotel and there is plenty going on a few stops away , Cool place interesting design Free films are great Handy for the south train station 
421658,citizenM Amsterdam, Toilet with half transparent walls literally in the middle of the room It s quite challenging to use it when you re travelling with your partner friend you should be really close to each other or it s a good way to melt ice between both of you , Modern stylish hotel very comfortable bed Easy to get from the airport Not far from the center You can get there either by tram which is round a corner or walk 
421659,citizenM Amsterdam, Perhaps just a couple of extra surfaces in the room to put belongings on would be useful , Very efficient and friendly as usual We know this hotel well and always find it comfortable and functional The bed is huge and very comfortable The atmosphere in the lobby bar lounge area is always great Well located with a 15 20 min tram trip into the centre of town They now have a system where you can put a Do not clean my room notice on the door in exchange for 1 x 10 voucher per day to use in their bar restaurant 
421660,citizenM Amsterdam, Room could ve been warmer a short we set temp to the highest which is was only 23 degrees I think it should ve gone higher we were still cold View was building site see through shower wSnt an issue but better if not , Staff were amazing Loved the movie choice
421661,citizenM Amsterdam, The cleaning of the room could have been better On both days the cleaners had been in but only made the bed I kind of expected new sheets and the rubbish empty bottles etc to be taken out But this is the only minor point I d definitely stay again , The hotel was fantastic and the staff wonderful It really is one of the coolest places I ve ever stayed The food is delicious and the 24 hour bar is just so great The room was perfect for our needs and we slept great it was so so quiet 
421662,citizenM Amsterdam, Only issue is that currently there is building work next door and the view out of our room was just the building site , Amazing location for public transport around the city and only a 30 minute gorgeous scenic walk into central Room was great with a lovely shower and comfy bed Staff are all super friendly and go out of their way for you 
421663,citizenM Amsterdam, Weird self check in system on a first come first serve basis Your room is only designated to you when you arrive So if you re the last one in you re left with what s available This was not said anywhere in hotel s details but a staff member said it when I was checking in The rooms are all the same but the one left for me was first floor next to huge construction site where work started 07 00 Also really price food for sale and quality of breakfast not in line with cost , The review score of 6 3 says pleasant Well that s an overstatement if there ever was one 
421664,citizenM Amsterdam, Very limited storage space in the room stepping over luggage isn t fun Also no packing space in shower or at basin The safe in the room is very small for 2 people s use Located out of the centre of town missing out on the vibe , Very funky design gigantic bed with great bedding Futuristic shower and loved the mood lighting All day all night cafeteria with fresh food is a hit Walking distance from public transport 
421665,citizenM Amsterdam, We found that there were hidden tricks behind some of the benefits this hotel offers For example the hotel offers a 10 euro voucher to guests who choose not to get their room cleaned everyday but the small print outlines that you must spend this voucher the day you receive it so we returned one night approx 12am to a voucher in our room to be told it was no longer valid as we were out all day We tried to NOT avail of this to avail you put a specific hanger on the door no hanger Clean my room and our room was not cleaned despite us wanting new towels bedding This was slightly annoying as it would have been nice to come back to a clean room Also a couple of days before arrival I got an email from the Hotel saying I was entitled to a free welcome drink when I asked about this I was told to sign up to an email newsletter and to produce all reciepts I had for the room after doing this I was THEN told I would not be entitled to a drink as I booked through Booking com Also city tax which was not outlined at booking added 20 euro to the price of the room Breakfast seemed very overpriced 16 50 euro per person for very basic breakfast I felt this was not value for money Our charger for the iPad which controls the room lights etc was temperamental and would often not charge the tablet luckily we had an iPad charger however this would be inconvenient if you didnt have one , This hotel was brilliant very modern and extremely well designed I stayed here with my boyfriend for 3 nights Saturday Tuesday I spent the weekend thinking this hotel was too good to be true and was wondering what the catch was but there wasn t any Check in out and room was very high tech Check in out was all self service and members of staff are available should you need help Shower and toilet were in pods within the bedroom but this was far from a problem there was also a curtain which split the room in half so that the bathroom pods were separated from the bed which we didnt need to use as the glass in the toilet pod is frosted and not see through might be slightly awkward if you re not traveling with your partner or close family memebers but the curtain would help in that case Biggest bed I have ever seen wall to wall next to a huge window Free movies some of which were very new and international TV channels were also available which was greatly appreciated Room is controlled with an iPad which is a cool gimmick for those who have never experienced something like that it also means that the whole room can be controlled and you don t even have to stand up Room and hotel decor was very modern with excellent use of space From reading other reviews prior to my stay I was expecting a much smaller room than what I got Facilities were very modern including a large rain shower and automatic blackout blinds mood lighting and a large flatscreen tv above bed Room also has an easy to use safe Location was ideal the tram stop is much closer than I expected and as we got a 3 day pass available to purchase at hotel for approx 17 18 euros we could come and go as we pleased Tram was about 15 20 minutes to city center with many stops at landmarks along the way Also the hotel is a very short walk from the train station Amsterdam Zuid station which meant that getting from Schipol Airport to Citizen M was very easy 
421666,citizenM Amsterdam, The breakfast was poor considering the price The room including the wc area was not cleaned we had to call the reception after the entire day out from 9 30 am Room is small but well organized , Modern design hotel perfect for young couples everything in the room temperature tv lights can be controlled via ipad from the huge bed in front of the window The staff was very kind and always available to help 
421667,citizenM Amsterdam, There was no kettle in the room , It was a very cool hotel The room is amazing The staff were very great They speak good english Its in a quiet location with accessible tram 
421668,citizenM Amsterdam, Can t say anything bad about the hotel , Everything about the hotel was lovely The staff were friendly and so helpful and the room was amazing So glad i stayed here and would 100 stay again if i was to return to amsterdam 
421669,citizenM Amsterdam, More than 1 pillow each on the bed as one isn t enough the room needed a bit more room as it can be quite cramped And more toiletries such as toothpaste and shower gel , Extremely comfy bed lovely rain shower
421670,citizenM Amsterdam, There was no tea coffee facilities in the room which is a shame as we would have liked a warm cup of tea first thing in the morning as we get up Frosted glass to the toilets could be made more opaque and the shower needs to be frosted glass as well to better preserve privacy These are just minor bits and bobs which did not affect our overall experience the hotel was phenomenal , The room was technology oriented which was very impressive and is a step above the traditional hotel rooms Thoroughly enjoyed controlling the curtain and blinds via the iPad provided room lightings temperature and TV The connectivity of the systems worked flawlessly and contribute to a very unique and exciting experience for both my partner and I Rain shower was comfortable and the bed was huge The range of films available on TV was delightful and contributes to a perfect evening after a long day out travelling as you can just curl up in bed to enjoy the variety of films available Free iMacs for you to use and print your boarding passes was also a brilliant facility Location to the train station was perfect only 5 minutes walk and the train gets you to the airport in under 10 minutes Location to the nearest tram stop was also fantastic 3 minutes walk to the nearest stop which Tram 5 runs on that takes you into the city centre in about 15 minutes Brilliant experience and will definitely return to this hotel in the future 
421671,citizenM Amsterdam, Breakfast was quite limited and a little on the pricey side 17 euros for 2 small bowls of pineapples 2 hot chocolates and 5 mini Pain au chocolates Dinners were very limited to so had to eat else were They had an open buffet for both No kettles in rooms and we didn t realize you could get a food voucher if you didn t have house keeping we were told about everything else so missed out on about 40 euros of food vouchers , Staff were very helpful and friendly Check in and out was super quick took less then 5mins having toilet and shower pods in the room are very strange especially when sharing a room but the beds are great super big 2m so you have plenty room Lights tv all controlled by Ipads and lots of different selection Would defiantly stay at another CitizenM hotel 
421672,citizenM Amsterdam, Ridiculously tiny rooms they didn t even have a closet Badly advertised by Booking com If I knew all rooms were size of a shoe box I would have never gone to that property Only found out after checking in and had no choice was profoundly claustrophobic in there Terrible experience, Very contemporary
421673,citizenM Amsterdam, The shower and toilet are within the main living space and only separated by sliding glass doors so privacy is at a minimum Limited warm food selections , Excellent location staff and bar Good common areas for socializing Rooms are quiet TV and room controls are controlled with iPad which is different If you choose not to have your room cleaned you enjoy a 10 Euro credit per night which is very generous 
421674,citizenM Amsterdam, Lack of tea coffee facilities in bedroom , Lovely room quiet surroundings Nice breakfast in the morning with excellent coffees Great place to stay if going to RAI for a conference 
421675,citizenM Amsterdam, The sheer curtain that you can pull between the bathroom area and the bed should be thicker darker It wouldn t impact the room s open concept feel overall as you can pull it completely out of the way anyway I traveled alone so it was no problem but if I had been with another person a little more privacy and better blocking of light when you re in bed and someone is getting dressed would have been really good Also even when staying alone a thicker curtain option would have better blocked the light coming in from under the room door via the hallway I found the shower to be much more comfortable than I expected however the toilet was much less comfortable than I expected It feels really small once you close the doors The check in process was terrible and apparently doesn t really work for booking com customers this needs to be fixed Breakfast had a lot of options but the eggs were absolutely disgusting , The bed was giant and quite comfortable The room is unique as you can tell from the online photos Very high tech and customizable It was really nice to be able to adjust the lights including with colors and make it comfortable and suitable for work vs relaxing vs waking up I was worried the shower would leak into the room since this is a problem with so many hotel showers and especially since this shower was so different but I am pleased to say it did not leak at all It was a really nice shower and I liked that you had an option to use the handheld shower head OR the rain shower The wifi was fast and easy to connect to The hotel is a short walk from the Amsterdam Zuid station very convenient It is also technically within walking distance of the RAI but the trek is much longer than the 10 minutes the hotel claims it to be especially if you have luggage heavy things to carry or are wearing high heels tip bring comfortable shoes for the walk Amsterdam Zuid Oud Zuid area is not so happening but it s got plenty to offer and is relaxed and much more serene than your typical city center type Amsterdam visit 
421676,citizenM Amsterdam, I wish the location was a bit better There weren t many cute cafes or bars around but at least the tram that goes to the center stops right outside the hotel and the hotel sells 24 and 48 hour passes for the tram , I really liked the futuristic vibe of the hotel This was definitely one of the most interesting hotels that I have ever stayed at The bed was super comfortable and the shower was really cool rain shower in the middle of the room lit up by colorful lights However what really impressed me about the hotel was the staff They were so friendly and helpful and they made our stay really enjoyable 
421677,citizenM Amsterdam, It s a little bit tight for 2 people staying for more than 2 nights Not much space to unpack your luggage , The bed was exceptionally comfy and biiiiigggg And all the friendliest and most helpful people in Amsterdam are working at this Hotel This was the most wonderful experience to be welcomed and helped every time by the most friendly face s Thanks to all of you 
421678,citizenM Amsterdam, Although the room size is the same as that of the UK CitizenM s we have stayed at the separate toilet and shower cubicles make the space seem more cluttered , While slightly out of the city centre the hotel is very convenient 1st train stop from Schipol Airport and a short ride on the tram to the city centre The Eco Initiative of a 10 voucher for not changing towels and linen 
421679,citizenM Amsterdam, Street parking not ideal but space enough considering you re in a big city Naming the lower level rooms city view is a bit misleading but they made up for it with good entertainment, Super quick check in and check out no waiting and friendly service decent food late in the evening
421680,citizenM Amsterdam, The room was cramped and there was no wardrobe only 4 hangers provided for a double room Also a lack of privacy for the toilet and shower No kettle or tea coffee making facilities in the room , The bed was very very comfortable The room was very quiet and the shower was strong enough and the water good and hot Full size bodywash and shampoo provided conditioner provided on request Very modern comfortable feel to the room Gr8 hairdryer 
421681,citizenM Amsterdam, Small room no space for luggage, The bed was not as comfortable as I hoped It was a very small space so I felt the value for our money could have been better It was very trendy and cute but just not our style 
421682,citizenM Amsterdam, Not a huge amount of engaging bars or restaurants in the immediate vicinity , Good common parts to the hotel that make for an engaging experience The rooms are comfortable modern with sizeable bed Hotel is close to Amsterdam Zuid and fairly easy to get to central Amsterdam and Museum district by tram or 15min walk to Museum Square 40 min walk to the centre of the City 
421683,citizenM Amsterdam, Hotel lacks outdoor space and it was very sunny whilst we were there Food choices were limited , Loved the room for a short stay Loved the friendly helpful staff and the cocktails Film channel in room was good and use of ipad was easy Swedish girl Friday was a bundle of fun and energy 
421684,citizenM Amsterdam, There are some amazing facilities available to guests but I wasn t aware of them There isn t enough clarity around what is and is not available Especially the eco warrior 10 discount , The downstairs area was amazing its a really nice place to relax when you come back from the city The tram is a 2 minute walk away the train station is a t minute walk and a very short trip to the airport 15 minutes 
421685,citizenM Amsterdam, Pillow too soft and hence not enough Complicated shower toilet door and dripping shower head in the middle of the night, Interior design of the room vouchers that can be redeemed to purchase food drinks from the counter if we choose not to clean our room 
421686,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, It s not for everyone but if you like trying new things go for it It s like living in a capsule yet bright ergonomic very clean and very calm And the bed splendid 
421687,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, I love the bed The mattress is amazingly comfortable I really had a great rest Also I like that it s possible to connect to Apple TV so I watched movies that I downloaded on my phone months ago and had no time to watch 
421688,citizenM Amsterdam, The only thing that I think that needs to improve is there is no coffee machine tea in the room and when guests wake up thats one of the first things they want having to go to the bar is not one of them , The hotel as a whole is really nice close to the station and easy access to everything Nice and friendly staff and a very quirky hotel
421689,citizenM Amsterdam, On entering the extremely small room the first thing in front of me was the toilet with a shutter around it The shower had the same idea The width of the whole room was the size of the bed which touched wall to wall It was like a glorified hostel with an IPAD Having to control the lights and blinds with the iPad was more inconvenience than help I came for a weekend with my boyfriend and it was far from ideal the way the room was set out and certainly not romantic The mood lighting was ridiculous how can you create a nice atmosphere in a room with an exposed toilet sink and shower I found it comical The staff were friendly enough so I cannot fault them I would say this hotel is ok if you are travelling alone but it is not good value for money We could have stayed somewhere in the heart of amsterdam for the same money I would not recommend ,No Positive
421690,citizenM Amsterdam, the room is a bit tiny no tea coffe maker provided, good location where the WTC is 5 minuts walk and the Zuid train station in which you can reach the airport within 10 minuts Also you can reach the city Center within 20 25 minuts by catching tram 5 which is on the front of the hotel quick check in out very helpful staff
421691,citizenM Amsterdam, The only down is the funky toilet in the room I would suggest if you don t know the person you are staying with that well the toilet in the middle of the room even though you can completely lock yourself away in a shower cubicle style door can be a little impersonal Didn t effect us as Ive known my husband for over 30 years but i could imagine for a new couple it could be a problem, Clean sleek but still very friendly Although you are slightly out of town it is only a 10 minute tram ride into town from almost outside the hotel and 24 48 and 72 hour bus tickets can be purchased from the bar Rooms were cool and mood lighting and tv are all controlled by an iPad
421692,citizenM Amsterdam, 20 25 minute tram ride from Dam Square although tram stop is just outside which was a bonus , Very easy to get to from airport Big bed Good selection of TV channels in many languages Loved the ipad to control the room especially mood lighting
421693,citizenM Amsterdam, The rooms were a little small but it was only my husband and infant so worked for us , The amazing technology that was available in each room The greeter was extremely nice as well when checking in Very easy to check in and out as well 
421694,citizenM Amsterdam, Check in wasn t that great because the system was down I don t know how often that happens but I had a free beer while I waited so that was ok , Nice comfortable bed and everything you need I like that you can watch lots of different movies as well although I didn t 
421695,citizenM Amsterdam, No tea coffee facilities in room Open toilet a bit of a novelty There was very little hanging space especially for 2 people sharing , Bed was extremely comfy shower great
421696,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, the bed was amazing and the iPad to control the whole room was great funky toilet and shower The shower was amazing i will be having one similar installed at home 
421697,citizenM Amsterdam, Tram ride into central took around 25 minutes Would have preferred to stay a little closer , The room was perfectly clean the facilities were amazing Huge bed very quirky hotel 
421698,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Great room and facilities Relaxed and comfortable environment Very helpful staff Straight forward system to check in and check out Main town easily accessible by tram which stops just outside the hotel
421699,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Great hotel with very friendly and helpful staff have stayed here twice in the space of a year and will return soon Easy to travel to centre via tram stop next to hotel The bed is amazing like the iPad control and the room overall very enjoyable stay 
421700,citizenM Amsterdam, one of our rooms had not been cleaned another clean room was provided but this should not happem the ipad in the other room did not work and was not fixed until the second time 8 hours later I asked , cheerful service good breakfast
421701,citizenM Amsterdam, I hate the shower You have to be inside it with the doors fully closed in order for the water to turn on This is problematic when its cold outside and it takes awhile for the water heater to kick in , The bed is amazing Big and very comfortable The available movies and channels are also excellent The staff are kind and helpful Tram 5 stops just outside and Amsterdam Zuid Station is about a 5 minute walk away It is a perfect hotel for solo travelers This is my 2nd stay at the Amsterdam branch 
421702,citizenM Amsterdam, Location alittle bit off but it worked great with uber , Amazing and very proffessional staff The rums were clean and the bed comfortable Merel helped us check in and we were very happy with her Very proffessional and knows her job She explained evrything and made us know that the staff was available whenever we needed anythign 
421703,citizenM Amsterdam, Breakfast is fine food is delicious but the choice is somewhat limited especially fruit and vegetables , Very modern comfortable hotel nice living room like area Room TV has a very good entertainment system Location is OK tram train and metro stations are really close Hotel offers rent a bike service for FREE If you choose not to have the room cleaned you get a voucher for some drinks at the bar 
421704,citizenM Amsterdam, Toilet and bathroom are in the middle of the room and covered with glass Unsuitable for friends to stay together Breakfast is expensive , Location is good Tram and metro station are close to hotel 
421705,citizenM Amsterdam, Nice place but probably better to stay in the city or at the airport Easy commute to Museums Staff were great , Late check out was okay for 29EU I got to stay till 5pm Which worked perfect for my 9pm flight
421706,citizenM Amsterdam, Some variation or additional options in the breakfast buffet would make it a top option , Friendly and helpful staff aesthetically interesting and clean environment very comfortable bed One cannot ask for more 
421707,citizenM Amsterdam, Overall very expensive booked last minute Expensive taxi ride from and back to the airport with no other known method of transit It wasn t clear where we were and the hotel is just in the middle of a business area not close to anything we could quickly use our time for and enjoy Expensive and not very impressive breakfast , Ended up here because of delays at Amsterdam airport The room was quirky and really modern Probably very good for local business travellers 
421708,citizenM Amsterdam, none, perfect location 5 mins walk to tram 5 to city center 15 mins walk to metro 3 to schipol very friendly and helpfull staffs room is uniquely comfortable designed bed is huge shower and toilet glass cylinder is special design feature has a special ironing room which is so convenient i will come back to this feel at home citizenM family 
421709,citizenM Amsterdam, Very minor and didn t effect our stay at all but they offered us 10 voucher for the bar if room didn t need cleaning but it runs out on the same day it s left in the room around 5pm Received the voucher only when we got in after midnight , Great location and easy access to centre of Amsterdam 25 minutes to Centraal station either tram or metro very modern rooms very clean spacious huge bed staff very helpful would definitely use again 
421710,citizenM Amsterdam, There was nothing to detract from how amazing this hotel was , Amazing hotel great staff excellent location couldn t have asked for a better place to stay 
421711,citizenM Amsterdam, There are not a lot of restaurants nearby but with tram or else 10 min walk you are in a nice area The room was clean but not spotless that is the only small point where the hotel could improve , Excellent hotel for business or if you are looking for a good level of comfort for reasonable price Very modern and keen on domotica Everything you need to work internet printer common pc s and a large bed to relax The rooms are small rooms but they do not feel small Eye for design AND functionality Everything is done in purpose of function Highly recommendable 
421712,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, We like everything in citizenm hotel The facilities were very advanced powered by IPAD the cleanliness was great The employees were very approachable and very helpful The breakfast serve was the best buffet breakfast ever Indeed I wish to go back again and recommend it 
421713,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing , The room was amazing best hotel ever will be staying here again The whole room was controlled by an IPAD Free movies on the TV best hotel ever 
421714,citizenM Amsterdam, The bed wasn t comfortable too hard Also the rooms were pokey and very strange with the toilet open in the middle of the room Food was poor and very overpriced , Comfortable downstairs common area lovely helpful staff clean 
421715,citizenM Amsterdam, Shower drips it s in the room so it s very loud and wakes you up I ve stayed here 5 times and the shower always drops it wasn t a one off The new citizen m bathrooms at airport much better No hot water shower both mornings , Good staff easy seamless check in king beds 
421716,citizenM Amsterdam, The toilet in my room kept making noise all the time which made it hard to go to sleep , Location near Amsterdam Zuid station very friendly staff well designed room excellent shower large comfortable bed reliable wifi for free great movie selection for free good breakfast 
421717,citizenM Amsterdam, The location was initially surprising as we expected to be a bit closer to the centre but after sussing out the local tram timetable it was really easy to get about only 7 50 for a full day ticket too , The rooms were lovely and clean and the beds were super comfy The film s on the mood pad were a bonus too after a busy day exploring We would like to return this year 
421718,citizenM Amsterdam, The food, I thought the hotel was lovely but the food wasn t great and a didnt really feel like we had a lot of choice for breakfast I was going to add it on to my package at the hotel when I arrived but when I seen what they had to offer I didn t think it was great there also isn t very much to do around the hotel hardly any shops and the shops that were around closed early I feel the hotel would have been suited much better to me if if was closer to the city centre but I did enjoy my stay and the room was lovely 
421719,citizenM Amsterdam, At night in silence you can hear from time to time the toilet with the water filling up the tank We didn t had a problem with this but if you re a light sleeper it might affect you a bit , Hotel is located one train stop away from the airport It is not that close to city center but consider it a chance to see more of Amsterdam while walking or biking Great public transportation is also available just use Google Maps for the fastest route Check in is automated via computers in the lobby you pay at check in only by card The rooms are clearly designed for couples the shower and toilet are in the middle of the room in transparent shower and semi opaque toilet glass cylinders Entire room is controlled via an iPad including TV lights ambient lights window curtains The bed is huuuge and it s amazing Overall the room has a great vibe If you want something different than your standard hotel this is the perfect place 
421720,citizenM Amsterdam, full airconditioned rooms with no chance to open a window or turn off AC i felt locked in toilet and shower are within the room which might be cool design wise but i hope it is only in single rooms if this would be a shared room with partner or friends it is well akward the tram no5 is in front of the hotel and should offer a direct connection to the amsterdam center but the ride is annoying often delayed overcrowded and it takes half an hour and more No wonder is everyone riding bike, very clean Intelligent smart room design big bed friendly staff cool lobby to hang out and have a drink fast connection to the airport via amsterdam zuid and the trains
421721,citizenM Amsterdam, The room feels a bit claustrophobic without real windows there is a large glass but you cannot open it Also a lot of tech for nothing you have to use a tablet to control everything from temperature to light to TV Finally the shower and the WC in the middle of the room isn t a particularly cool choice It saves space the room is overall quite small but it s ugly and it feels like being inside the bathroom all the time in addition to little privacy when traveling with someone else The first thing you see when getting inside is the wc toilet in the middle of the room if you slalom between them you can find the bed and a closed window covered by layers of automatic blinds , High quality great breakfast Lovely staff Comfortable bed Nice large colorful common spaces Good insulation from noise 
421722,citizenM Amsterdam, I just wish the rooms were bigger, The staff were friendly and helpful Loved how modern the whole hotel was and loved that the rooms were so technology focussed You can control the mood lighting with an ipad Watch free films to your hearts content Modern bathrooms Couldn t have asked for a better stay 
421723,citizenM Amsterdam, The dinner that is provided in the hotel is quite poor in choice and quality Almost every dish is heavily spiced So if you consider having a dinner in the hotel please think twice The breakfast is ok on the other hand so I d recommend to take it , The location is quite close to the Amsterdam Zuid train station and metro Also there is a special 10 euro voucher for non cleaning that could be redeemed at the canteen on the same day in the evening This offer is only valid for the visitors who stay more than one night 
421724,citizenM Amsterdam, My only gripe is that the food offering was a little poor Not really into microwave meals from a fridge Breakfast is superb though, The whole place from the room to the bar was amazing The staff are awesome 
421725,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing major we would have liked a fridge in the room the keep the water cool and a mini kettle for those early morning cups of tea but it was all available downstairs in the canteen , The bed was insanely comfortable completely got rid of our jet lag The shower was amazing and the shower gel they give you woke us right up Great new movie selection available Very close to the city center and all the available attraction 
421726,citizenM Amsterdam, room was a little small and I wish it was a little closer to the center of the city but public transit was easy to use, Loved the modern feel and the canteen as well as the shower and iPad to control the room
421727,citizenM Amsterdam, Could have used more toiletries toothpaste and a mini bar or at least a tiny fridge for storing drinks snacks , Customer service is great good location next to the station easy self check in comfy extra large bed 
421728,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Big fan of this brand of hotel with consistent service across all destinations Although largely self service including check in staff are a highlight always friendly cheerful helpful and I even got a high five from one Rooms are small but functional and comfortable Even suitable for informal business meetings in downstairs lounge area Food is a good standard in a straightforward way particularly pleased to have Indonesian for this stay Generally a very good concept and ethos for a city hotel
421729,citizenM Amsterdam, Not in the centre of Amsterdam but close to the main train link to the airport , Love all CitizenM hotels great rooms and facilities within the hotel Easy check in and check out 
421730,citizenM Amsterdam, I can t fault much about the hotel at all , Huge beds were so comfortable and having free movies is amazing for cold nights when you re not staying out late The staff were so friendly and helpful They gave us all the information about where to go and how to get there without any hassle 
421731,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing The little problem is that the shower in room 534 worked not that well it ran a bit weakly, Location Easy to reach Only one stop from the train station in Schipol Airport The tram No 5 is just steps away and it runs very frequently and easy to get to city centre Comfy bed Friendly staff Atmosphere in Lobby Eco saver voucher
421732,citizenM Amsterdam, Cost of laundry was the only real negative, Loved the style of the bedroom and the feeling of spaciousness liked the speed of checking in and out liked getting canteen vouchers for being eco friendly
421733,citizenM Amsterdam, They can do better in room cleanliness I found a little bit of dust at the outside boundaries of bathroom and shower cylinder Could be a little small for long stay , Awesome stylish room with fluffy king size bed and pillows Shower and bathroom were inside glass cylinders in the middle of the room so unconventional You can control light temperature and entertainment system through an Ipad without leaving your bed Wi fi was very fast Located just in front of WTC great if you stay for business stuff and bus tram stop 10 minutes for Museumplein Room has every facility you may need as well as daily complimentary water 
421734,citizenM Amsterdam, A room a little bit small but for one person it s OK really this is not a problem, Very big and convenient bad Electronic room controls from iPad
421735,citizenM Amsterdam, NON TRANSPARENT Courtain you take the shower in the middle of the room under the eyes of everybody Make sure you have no privacy issues Toilets should be soundproof a bit embarassing to let everybody hear u , Domotic super cool Design Lighting to adapt to the mood fantastic welcome at arrival Self checkin check out
421736,citizenM Amsterdam, Rooms are modest size and bathroom pods are fun but not the most practical , Fun hotel alternative set up Easy access to airport via Amsterdam Zuid train station Tram to city works well 
421737,citizenM Amsterdam, Toilet in our room took about an hour to fill up after being flushed, easy access to airport and city centre via public transport Wonderful staff friendly helpful and happy fantastic bed 
421738,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, The beds were very comfy and the shower was amazing Staff were very friendly and helpful Only a 10 minute team journey from the city centre Overall a great place to stay 
421739,citizenM Amsterdam, On the street parking was relatively expensive at 3 eur hour for outskirts of Amsterdam The shower toilet spaces in the room inside retractable glass doors were ok since I was travelling alone but would have been a nightmare otherwise Showerhead kept leaking water randomly throughout the night no matter which way the control was turned , Excellent variety of vegan food options and good coffee Super helpful friendly yet non intrusive staff technology in the room worked seamlessly The option to get a 10 eur voucher night if you don t need your room cleaned was great for a business traveller that hardly spends time in the room anyway Quiet I chose a top floor garden view room 
421740,citizenM Amsterdam, I ve seen a fair share of exposed bathrooms in hotel rooms but this was the most extreme so far Upon entering the room you have to walk past the toilet seat enclosed in a transluscent floor to ceiling tube and the shower in a transparent tube The wash basin is open plan It was fine for one person but I can imagine it to be rather awkward if you are 2 even if you re travelling with your partner It did feel a lot like I was sleeping in the bathroom and despite the high tech features like iPad controlled lights and blinds I felt it was worth much less than the 150 per night it costed , Huge comfortable bed fast wifi friendly bar with meals and snacks The free bottles of water in the room was a nice touch 
421741,citizenM Amsterdam, Slightly far from city centre about 30 mins walk but tons of transit options train and tram very nearby hotel, Front desk and bar staff were lovely and helpful Rooms were small but the layout was well planned so you still managed to get a massive bed in there Considering the hotel prices in Amsterdam this one is definitely one of the better priced hotels there
421742,citizenM Amsterdam, The breakfast was ok but very simple The selection is not quite big , The bed was extremely big and comfy we slept great The entertainment program is very good too 
421743,citizenM Amsterdam, We didn t like the pillows very much but ofcourse that s very personal Other than that these rooms are not suited for people who aren t couples or very close friends the shower is see through and the toilet doesn t cover any noise since they are both in the room covered in a glass capsule Especially the toilet was not very pleasant we both had some stomach issues during the night because of something we ate and then to literally have to be IN the room instead of in a bathroom wasn t comfortable at all , Very nice hotel cosy and practically designed rooms with great media system The staff is very welcoming and helpful and even had placed balloons in our room since it was my boyfriends birthday Tram 5 stops right around the corner and the trainstation is a 3min walk away It s easy to walk around or get to the city centre in no time 
421744,citizenM Amsterdam, The rooms are small and you have to know your roomy very well as the shower and toilet are in the middle of the room and have glass doors The shower handle was very hard to turn Annoying was that the Ipad ran out of battery and we had to recharge Even though we only stayed the night I stretched a muscle climbing over my partner to get out of bed My shoulder still hurts , The shower is comfortable and the toilet is roomy enough In the room a lot is controlled with an Ipad It was easy to do and also interesting The bed was comfortable but having to climb over your partner to reach the toilet was not nice Best thing of the stay was the cleanliness the free movies of good quality only English btw and no subtitles and the friendly helpful personnel 
421745,citizenM Amsterdam, Asked for invoice with company details and received it without and needed to ask the hotel to correct it , Staff was extremely helpful and hospitable Great drinks in the bar free welcoming and farewell drink Breakfast simple but tasty Room controls from Ipad is a great idea 
421746,citizenM Amsterdam, Should have been much cleaner Overall I enjoy the interesting design decisions at the hotel but some of them are not practical Especially the sink which makes a mess because it s very small and not practical I would also say invest more in cleaning up before a guest arrives I had paper in the toilet and dust on some places , The bed is incredible it s at least 2 by 2 meters and very comfortable The shower is awesome They have improved the breakfast experience a lot you have everything you would expect I like the intelligent room control with an iPad all the settings worked The TV is very large and offers nice channels and movies for free The canteen is pretty cool offers basically everything you would need and a decent coffee not like most hotels The common area is spacious and relaxing The staff is friendly and helpful great people work there The location is very practical you have a train and metro station near by as well as bus and tram stops I would surely recommend this for any business traveler but please keep in mind you need to be a bit twisted to accept all the design decisions 
421747,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff were very polite and very approachable the beds were really comfortable the hotel overall was amazing not too far from the city centre which is a tram away
421748,citizenM Amsterdam, taps in the shower quite stiff and needed to use some force to turn them on Lights mood useless as only the shower and the toilet can be moody not the rest of the room, Air play facility so you can stream anything from your iphone
421749,citizenM Amsterdam, No negatives the bathroom capsule type compartments might not be everybody s cup of tea but certainly don t think they are a negative , Location is perfect for the business district and access to transport the hotel runs ever so smoothly access to loads of movies no extra cost is an added bonus if you want to crash and relax 
421750,citizenM Amsterdam, Free Wifi was not secure , Super modern hotel with the right amenities to make a tech oriented traveller feel right at home Props for the great showers 
421751,citizenM Amsterdam, The feature of having a the toilet and b the shower in the same room space though separated during use by frosted glass doors was a bit unusual and might not suit everyone s tastes or convenience ,No Positive
421752,citizenM Amsterdam, size of rooms and toilets in the middle of room are too much for comfortable feeling of privacy good for single occupation poor for couple that does not need to hear everything, very convenient location close to airport large train station and RAI congress center very helpful and friendly staff fast wifi and overall focus on technologies
421753,citizenM Amsterdam, Loved everything , Hotel was fantastic the bed was amazing so comfortable tv movie choice was brilliant also loved the mood lighting great touch Location was perfect right beside tram stop train station very easy to commute into the city 22mins on tram no5 into Amsterdam central only 7mins to the airport on the train for 3 50 what a bargain Definitely be back 
421754,citizenM Amsterdam, Rooms are a little bit small and only for couples Shower place is transparent but with curtains , Location close to Zuid station Very convenient if you want to travel by plane Facilities are good 
421755,citizenM Amsterdam, The shower was really hard to figure out It would be helpful if they had temp settings for the water because I took a freezing cold shower more than once because I could not figure out the temp settings and the info pamphlet they give you in the room does not explain how to properly use the shower , The hotel is very nice and updated Everything is very tech savvy which I liked The breakfast buffet was amazing Great stay 
421756,citizenM Amsterdam, I do not like the toilet in the room It is the only thing that will make me not to choose this hotel again It is not OK to have there next to you to strange for me, The experience is unique It is a modern hotel The room is small but completely functional With everything up to date in terms of tehnology The lights the TV the bed and shower Super good I would only suggest a mirror on the selling where the bed is we had fun as a couple there Lots of it
421757,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing really, It s a trendy hip hotel Different from any other hotel chain It s fun staying at this hotel Amazing how they organise the room with little space Location is excellent Away from the noise of the centre but with very easy access to the centre due to the tram stop closeby Excellent for 1 2 nights to discover Amsterdam 
421758,citizenM Amsterdam, The shower is in a glass cubicle with zero privacy not even frosted glass and is not separate from the main bedroom Also it took a while to check in , The hotel was 5 mins walk from Amsterdam South railway station and 30 seconds away from the tram stop The city can be easily I cared by tram it takes around 15 mins to Dam Square The bed was very comfortable 
421759,citizenM Amsterdam, The room is a tight space that is for sure more ideal for one person than a couple Also the trash can in the room was tiny with a step lid I ve noticed these in other hotels around Europe and find them minorly frustrating The location was very convenient from the airport but most restaurant were a bit of a walk or uber ride , From the first interaction the staff were friendly and personable it is clear they are empowered by the property and happy to work there The facilities have a great energy from the 24 hour bar spacious lobby with lots of seating area to either socialiaze or have a water while waiting for an uber My favorite thing about the room was by far the bed so comfortable and unique Also the easy to use technology and english movie was fantastic Lastly the free bikes made it great to easily access the city like a local 
421760,citizenM Amsterdam, There is nothing to dislike It s an amazing place really , Me and my daughter had an amazing Festive night We will definitely come back again I have been telling about my friends and relatives about our experienced More Power See us again soon 
421761,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff were amazingly helpful and very friendly I found the atmosphere of the hotel bar and the rooms very cosy and very high tech Everything was amazing 
421762,citizenM Amsterdam, Little further out than expected but very good public transport system didn t make it a real issue, Staff and value for money were excellent as usual
421763,citizenM Amsterdam, The shower and toilets are in a transparent pod in the room was fine for me as I was staying with my sister but might not be great for a first couple holiday , Bed was so comfy and the films other up as features were a welcome addition 
421764,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Very good staff informed them about it being my girlfriends birthday and they decorated the room and gave us a free drink each at the bar Rooms where also very nice and good design
421765,citizenM Amsterdam, Whilst it s great to have a large bed with lots of space unfortunately I didn t find it very comfortable and didn t sleep particularly well as a result I also found that some of the lighting and temperature controls on the ipad were temperamental or didn t work properly for example mood lighting didn t always switch off with the rest of the lights , The staff are incredibly helpful and it was great to be able to buy tram passes at the hotel I like the concept of the hotel and the rooms although you d have to be comfortable with limited privacy Breakfast was reasonably well stocked for the price The hotel is well located for public transport which will get you to the city centre and to the airport quickly and cheaply 
421766,citizenM Amsterdam, The breakfast wasn t worth the money at all Bread was good but eggs and bacon tasted like nothing , Loved the lights and controls and that you can do everything with the iPad Shower was amazing 
421767,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Loved the atmosphere of the hotel lobby and the room Everything was very clean and worked perfectly The room is small but because it is so efficiently arranged there was more than enough space The location is great it is not in the city center but it is very close to train tram metro and bus stops which makes it really easy to get around 
421768,citizenM Amsterdam, If we were staying longer than a weekend we would have liked a little more space I missed being able to open a window, The staff were great The room was very clean and quirky 
421769,citizenM Amsterdam, Location is poor we went at new year and found it hard to travel into the central as trams and trains were stopped and taxis were expensive , Cannot fault anything staff we re brilliant and the hotel is amazing 
421770,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing highly recommended, A fantastic hotel experience Cool rooms of modern design The bed was huge and very comfortable Free movies in the room was great and the lounge space was welcoming The tram stop was a 2 minutes walk so you can be into the city in 15 minutes 
421771,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing I loved my stay here , Staff were so helpful and pleasant Hotel was great Rooms spotless and I loved all the cool iPad features and room lights Only thing is no privacy at all for toilet or shower but I knew this before I came Will definitely be returning Great decor throughout the hotel and bar area 
421772,citizenM Amsterdam, no soy drink for breakfast vegetarians vegans would greatly appreciate this therefore breakfast slightly overpriced, Friendly staff Airport public transport nearby computer facilities design of entrance hall very quiet rooms soundproof tablet to control room appliances and access to free films
421773,citizenM Amsterdam, CanteenM food was not nice and very expensive , 24 hour bar Self check in BIG bed TV The eco door hanger which gives you 10 to spend in canteenM in exchange for no room service Room controls Movies
421774,citizenM Amsterdam, Didn t like the fact no kettle or iron in the room I like my coffee but when u have to get dressed and 6am to go to bar for it or at any time it wasn t convenient bed great size but room size bit crammed for us we thought , Loved the decor lobby bar ando staff 5 star
421775,citizenM Amsterdam, The breakfast selection could have been a lot better without that much effort Considering the standard of hotel we expected better , The decor was amazing really wanted to get back to the hotel after being freezing in Dam in December Ipad controlled rooms Nice touch 
421776,citizenM Amsterdam, Only 2 pillows on massive bed but to be fair we didn t ask for more so can t complain They say the rooms are small which wasn t an issue but if you are a private person you may not like the toilet set up , I loved the location you can catch a number 5 tram pretty much outside the hotel into central Takes 15 mins roughly Zuid train station is 3 minute walk from hotel and one stop from airport which is great Free wifi free good movies biggest bed very comfy Can get food drink 24 7 they don t just say that There is someone ready to make you a coffee at 4am if you wish They also give you a 10 voucher to spend in canteen if you choose not to have your room cleaned that day which is a nice touch 
421777,citizenM Amsterdam, Even though I liked the idea of the bathroom and the shower I was a bit uncomfortable with the feeling of kind of lack of privacy when using them , Very comfortable bed Nice touch to the overall design Very cosy ambiance in the lobby and in general 
421778,citizenM Amsterdam, Just a very small thing the towel stand is far from the shower cabin, Excellent staff Very interesting and efficient concept of hospitality Amazing bed 
421779,citizenM Amsterdam, The parking advertised isn t that close and is EUR50 a night Shouldn t really be ticked as included , All good standard CitizenM stuff cool but small room
421780,citizenM Amsterdam, Everything is placed in one room First the toilet then the shower and at least the bed The shower and the toilet are quite close to each other This gives a limited space to maneuver and a limited space to place your bags or clothes due to the lack of a cabinet This is absolutely no room for colleagues due to the lack of privacy , The room was very nice and clean The staff was very friendly and helpful The breakfast is good and sufficient even late in the morning Very close to the station 
421781,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing I didn t really like but the air con in the room was a bit cold as it was winter I would like the 25 degrees to actually feel like 25 degrees , The ipad in the room that allowed me to control everything was just amazing Never had this experience before ever 
421782,citizenM Amsterdam, Ventilation a bit noisy located in a area with few restaurants within walking distance, Very friendly staff modern facilities comfortable huge bed good meals walking distance to train station 10 min from Schipol airport 
421783,citizenM Amsterdam, I do not like the idea of putting a shower cabin and a toilet unit too close to the bed Because of that the room feels very cramped Too much plastic A bit minimalistic to me, Staff was friendly and helpful Bed was comfortable
421784,citizenM Amsterdam, The toilet is awkward and inconvenient Although I had read the comments I could not imagine how uncomfortable it would feel using a toilet and be seen from the others in the room , The staff was great Polite smiley and helpful The hotel is only a station away from Schiphol airport by train and 3 minutes walk from tram station The hotel lobby was very comfy having a 24 7 bar and snack area 
421785,citizenM Amsterdam, I am not so fond of the toilet in a glass pipe , Great breakfast Superb Crispiest bacon ever And great choice of everything Beds are very good as well 
421786,citizenM Amsterdam, The shower in room 516 had a defect and when working it was too hot The bed was spotless clean as I m used to but there were large spots on the floor of the shower and in the toilet As I booked another room the next day I didnt make any fuzz of it so I m sure if I did the CitizenM crew would do their best to get rid of the stains , Still like the meals comfort of the rooms location ground floor area and garden view room movies and extra s If you re a gadget lady or gent don t hessitate to book especially when the price is in your range 
421787,citizenM Amsterdam, The customer service right from arrival was terrible didnt make any effort to make you feel welcome Werent very friendly which was a big downfall on our stay , The bed was comfy good tv with lots to watch The room was clean loved the shower
421788,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Everything was awesome especially the comfortable bed and bedding and I loved the ambiance options for the rooms the super cool sayings throughout the hotel the amazing coffee the easy access to the center and airport Was beyond the usual hotel experience 
421789,citizenM Amsterdam, Not so much what I didn t like but the pricing for food is a bit steep For travellers on a budget there is a Wagamama nearby and also lots of places within Amsterdam who may find it more beneficial to eat there , The hotel was immaculate Lovely lobby bar rooms and even our view wasn t so bad Loved the iPad that enabled us to change the mood lighting of our rooms and the automatic blind Free movies was an added bonus The staff were attentive and always on hand to help for example when the free printer ran out of ink they were quick to help out and printed off my documents for me Very easy to get into the centre of Amsterdam from the hotel and did you re not sure staff are easily accessible to get instructions from Would definitely stay in this hotel if I visited this lovely city again 
421790,citizenM Amsterdam, Didn t like that the sink wasn t in a pod but in the middle of the room Didn t bother me though , Amazing bed room controls are very fun
421791,citizenM Amsterdam, It was difficult at first to deal with the lack of privacy in the room which was reflected in the shower with clear glass and open toilets in the room with frosted glass Also in my opinion really small room , I loved the breakfast warm attitude and excellent service of the hotel staff and the special design and unique hotel 
421792,citizenM Amsterdam, Very upset with this property Not only was it very expensive but the super modern attempt at room design is outrageous You can t use the toilet without someone else in the room seeing you and the tech didn t work The shower dripped and we couldn t stop it and couldn t sleep I was promised a discount on my room but this was never given and I ve not had luck calling them Just very poor really and wouldn t recommend this property ,No Positive
421793,citizenM Amsterdam, I liked everything but if I had to criticize something it would be the fact that it is a bit far from the centre but I knew this when I booked it , The rooms were incredibly comfortable the food was nice and he staff were great 
421794,citizenM Amsterdam, The room was a little too compact and the shower was very awkward to adjust Some of the tech is a bit gimmicky and doesn t really offer much benefit , Staff are very friendly and heldful and overall its a comfortable place to stay The food is tasty but expensive for whats on offer 
421795,citizenM Amsterdam, Rooms are too small and the cleaning of the hotel room isn t the best i have seen Trash wasn t emptied once toilet paper rolls haven t been refilled and the shower bottom for some reason was yellow so that i just went in there with flip flops on , The frontdesk and CantinaM staff is amazing very friendly and pro active The best i have probably seen in any hotel over the last year 
421796,citizenM Amsterdam, Staff at the bar was too confused one night forgot our order and forgot to give change It will be better to have some classic things in Room such Cotton pads Trays were little bit dirty, Everything was great modern and lot of Lights in the Room Great lobby Easy check in and check out Near public transport Comfy bed Great breakfast Nice Room view
421797,citizenM Amsterdam, There was nowhere to sit and get ready the mirror the chair and the table are all in different places , The bed is very comfortable and the room is controlled by an iPad and has a great selection of films music etc
421798,citizenM Amsterdam, Small room More space requested for a decent desk and comfortable fauteuil or small sofa to allow a relaxed sit read , Very friendly staff pleasant environment good breakfast 
421799,citizenM Amsterdam, It was a bit too hipster for my liking Having a loo and a shower open 3 feet from where I sleep is not my idea of comfort and that too at a fair cost Breakfast for 13 eur and to get just eggs and bacon is laughable I m not going to be staying at this place again Maybe I m too old for this kind of a hotel , It was near my office
421800,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, This was the neatest hotel I ve ever stayed in So modern and absolutely perfect for a layover for a couple or if you just plan to sleep there which is what most travelers to a new city should do The beds are humongous the electronically controlled mood setting for the room and the black out curtain are exactly what a weary jet lagged traveler needs and this hotel caters to individual or couples perfectly 
421801,citizenM Amsterdam, I mean it s OK to turn the TV on from the iPad but I would rather prefer good old fashioned things a glass for water in the room the shower which is easy to deal with please clean my room tag which normal hotels usually have Also the staff was quite rood to me your name is green tea told one of the bartenders when I misheard his question That was rood , Nothing I will never ever stay in this hole again 
421802,citizenM Amsterdam, the high tech installation in the room isn t always easy to understand light blinds , the all concept of the chain VITRA furniture in the common areas comfort of the bed movies selection for free very convenient location nearby Amsterdam south train station in front of tramway line 5 to center 
421803,citizenM Amsterdam, Lack of ventilation There is no control over the A C and there is no opening window so it can get quite steamy with the open plan shower , A relaxed and informal atmosphere with friendly and helpful staff They served a very good buffet breakfast and dinner if a limited selection I personally prefer that they do a few things well but this may not suit all They also have a well stocked bar The large bed was also very comfortable 
421804,citizenM Amsterdam, First morning the internet failed This led to there being no hot water for showers and having to stumble around to locate the light switch as the Ipad which controlled the lights would not work Due to the internet being down the staff were unable to provide receipts , Quick and easy check in
421805,citizenM Amsterdam, The hotel is very nice but the rooms are very small and a bit over desgined for my taste almost feels like you re sleeping in the bathroom Office neighborhood but 10 minutes to downtown by car , Quick self service check in and check out fast wifi ok bar 
421806,citizenM Amsterdam, the bed is walled in so one person has to crawl over the other to get to the rest of the room Also the TV should not be included in the main switch on the wall because it turns it off when you are watching a show , Loved the concept took a couple of days to get used to the unique room but once we get settled it was a great concept that we totally loved Walking distance through a very nice park to get to the RAI convention center was a big plus 
421807,citizenM Amsterdam, Location advertised wrongly a lot further out of centre than expected Extra 83 for three morning breakfasts rip off for hard bacon soggy eggs and poor continental selection , Bed super comfy and loved the layout of the room Couples only type of room as no privacy but suited us fine Very clean Staff brilliant and helpful on check in and check out Lounge relaxing and inviting 
421808,citizenM Amsterdam, Location was far out from city centre for a city break Room temperature also took a while to heat up Toilet as a central pod with just a screen also offers not much privacy , Rooms are compact but efficient and cosy Staff are super friendly and free bike hire was great While location was far out it did mean we got to explore other more local areas outside the city centre
421809,citizenM Amsterdam, Something small Toilet kept refilling as if it had been flushed all night which was very loud considering the room is small Water was very slow to go down drain in sink also , Bed was extremely comfortable and the mood lighting was very impressive The staff were very friendly and professional Overall really enjoyed the atmosphere in this hotel 
421810,citizenM Amsterdam, We liked it all but if sharing a room be aware it s a smallish space with pods for toilets so quite intimate , Everything you need in a hotel and right next to transport Management very friendly and as it was for a birthday they put welcome notes in the room prosecco and balloons at no extra charge 
421811,citizenM Amsterdam, In room amenities were a bit sparse Not having a kettle in the room is ridiculous The reason given is to encourage people to socialise in the lounge areas downstairs If that is the reason why then charge 2 50 for a cup of tea Why not make them free and let people socialise The philosophy doesn t quite add up but the profits do we spent over 720 on 4 nights away The room toilets are not great either hotel breaks are a good chance for romance in a long term relationship but seeing and hearing your spouse going to the toilet through some frosted glass is a bit of a mood killer No conditioner in the shower but 2 types of shampoo seriously Breakfast was tasty but expensive at 13 each we found a bagel shop down the road that was half the price and had better coffee Overall we paid a lot of money for a fancy hotel that didn t quite live up to the price The gimmicks were fun but in the end I d rather switch the lights on myself and have a truly private toilet and a coffee in bed , The hotel was very trendy It was a novelty to control lights blinds etc through an ipad There were nice healthy food options at breakfast and dinner The free movies were really good The bed was comfortable and big The staff were really friendly 
421812,citizenM Amsterdam, hotel is located too out the way from the busy city center had to take trams to city center everyday no one told us that later check out cost 30 euros which we were surprised by when we to checked out , they gave my boyfriend a lovely surprise with balloons a littler cake etc very pleased with this taxi to hotel from centraal station reasonably priced staff are AMAZING in all aspects of their job 
421813,citizenM Amsterdam, Having stayed here before I knew what to expect but Citizen M hotels have a distinct modern concept which may not suit those who prefer traditional hotels , Decent sized flatscreen TV with wide range of channels and films at no extra cost Room facilities TV lights blinds etc controlled by iPad Room was quiet facing to rear of property Well located for the Amsterdam Marathon 
421814,citizenM Amsterdam, The room is not comfortable for 2 people It s small but then the shower and toilet are in very weird pods and this is in the way The bed is also difficult to get out of and not wake the other person, Great location for access to the marathon Nice breakfast
421815,citizenM Amsterdam, Already fairly pricey for what you get Also the breakfast was very pricey The location is also a little way from the city center but can be accessed by tram very easily if you dont mind paying, Room was very modern and was as was expected Plenty of storage for the space available Very close to a tram stop 
421816,citizenM Amsterdam, I feel the location was a bit far away from the centre of town but to be fair there was a tram right outside , The facilities in the room were great Staff very friendly and went the extra mile for my partners birthday 
421817,citizenM Amsterdam, The toilet is in the middle of the room Yes it s part of the cool design but there s still a toilet in the middle of the room It doesn t matter how close my travel companions are to me I personally find it a bit embarassing to do a 2 only separated by a glass tube There s no separate ventilation system inside the toilet tube either , Near Amsterdam Zuid Station easy and cheap to reach from the airport and near a Tram station that takes you to the city center The rooms are very nice the bed is huge and comfortable the lighting and the entertainment systems are great I does make you want to spend more time indoors and enjoy it more 
421818,citizenM Amsterdam, The only improvement would be to offer room service takeaway delivery service , The room was so much fun I loved the big bed the rainfall shower and the mood lighting For friends couples that are traveling together be warned there isn t much privacy in regards to showering using the toilet I was travelling on my own so it wasn t an issue for me The staff were really friendly breakfast was great and the snack options at the bar were awesome Highly recommend for a sleek and different experience 
421819,citizenM Amsterdam, The bill had been split per room when I booked as a group under 1 bill , The room was great really funky The bed was the most comfortable I have slept in and the quilt was lovely The staff were all very friendly food wholesome and fresh and the cocktails were well made 
421820,citizenM Amsterdam, The bed was too comfortable an made it difficult to get up in the morning , The staff were fantastically helpful and welcoming The hotel is located perfectly being just a 2 minute walk from the train station 7 for 2 people to the airport instead of 50 70 in a taxi and right next to metro line 5 which takes you into the heart of Amsterdam The room itself was clean and welcoming The personalization on the IPad room control and the TV was also a nice touch In short one of the best places I have ever stayed in 
421821,citizenM Amsterdam, If I was sharing with someone there really isa bit too little space and privacy, I liked the clever design details of the room and it works fine for a solo traveller
421822,citizenM Amsterdam, Need to accept their concept of small rooms Not much wardrobe space , Excellent staff Location very good for my business purposes but not necessarily for tourism Great common areas with diverse functions and good design Good food considering there is no restaurant Comfortable bed 
421823,citizenM Amsterdam, There were 2 of us booking the airport hotel only to find out there was a city hotel which was booked instead of the airport This was very upsetting We felt the websites were deceiving since 2 of us did the same error Later we went back to the website and retraced our steps and clearly felt the site was problematic Make sure you book the correct location as it cost us 80 euro in taxi fees,No Positive
421824,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, great philosophy behind the hotel They do what they promise on their website And still they have time for the personal touch Very impressed by all that 
421825,citizenM Amsterdam, Ridiculously expensive but then again all hotels in Amsterdam are , Very extraordinary rooms and super comfortable bed Staff were extremely nice The hotel borrows you a bike so you can cycle to the more hip neighborhoods in 10 minutes and downtown in 20 minutes Train station just a few steps away 
421826,citizenM Amsterdam, Hotel didn t take online payment and I was forced to pay via credit card on arrival incurring heafty 3 additional charges from the hotel themselves as well as from my bank Given how small the rooms are albeit well designed the hotel is overpriced , Cool room design Free wifi and movies
421827,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing , Can t wait to return Location very convenient staff couldn t have been more helpful and hotel was excellent Room facilities keep you well entertained 
421828,citizenM Amsterdam, They couldn t find the booking Not on the guest name the name of the person who did the booking and also not on the booking number Very confusing for the guest We booked two rooms on different guest names All the invoices we received were on one guest name , Value for money is okay
421829,citizenM Amsterdam, Air con made a racket during the night and you can t switch it off No hooks to hang your coat or bag up which was a pain Bin in room was tiny Not a fan of the toilet you can see far too much for my liking I got a bit claustrophobic by the end of the second day and we weren t in the room much Can t open windows to get fresh air in There is nothing around the hotel other than flats and offices No tea coffee making facilities Only two pillows , Staff were nice Reception area was modern and welcoming Tram stop and train very close Great selection of movies to watch Free safe in the room 
421830,citizenM Amsterdam, We didn t realise how far away we were from the city centre however the metro and tram stations were nearby and were good value for money and just a short trip into the centre , The staff were really friendly Rooms were modern and clean The complimentary bottles of water every day and the free movies and tv channels were a nice touch 
421831,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, CitizenM Amsterdam was the perfect hotel for our trip only 14 minute from Centraal Station on the Metro or 23 minutes on the tram staff were friendly and helpful and the bed and room was amazing Would definitely go back again 
421832,citizenM Amsterdam, The shower and toilet pods can create a tight squeeze to move around the room unless you leave the doors open Breakfast is expensive , Everyone was extremely accommodating and helpful during our stay The hotel even sold public transit cards to use the tram system around the city The tram stop is right across the street and leads to the heart of Amsterdam The hotel and rooms are hip and funky The room s lighting and mood controls are absolute fun We stayed the last two nights of our 16 day Europe honeymoon and this was the only hotel to acknowledge and celebrate our honeymoon The congratulatory note and complementary champagne really personalized our stay The convenience and character of this hotel alone definitely earn a full 10 10 
421833,citizenM Amsterdam, Couldn t really start finding faults Rooms are on the small side but very well laid out , Never was in a more comfortable bed Very clean all over too 
421834,citizenM Amsterdam, The price of the room considering breakfast wasn t included the 29euro charge for late check out and also the taxi that the hotel ordered over charged us massively , I thought the staff were great 
421835,citizenM Amsterdam, Only good if your staying for a very short time Pod size means two nights was enough , Location just 9 stops on the metro and made me feel I was living life like a true Amsterdam native Spotless area excellent 
421836,citizenM Amsterdam, Mattress is very thin and hard The shower and toilet in the middle of the room look cool but are quite unpractical Shower was almost impossible to turn on or off and kept dripping throughout the night which made annoying sounds I couldn t figure out how to turn on the bed lamps , Breakfast is pricey but good The hotel and rooms look very modern Location is good if you need to be close to the airport or one of the businesses in the area Station Amsterdam Zuid is just a 5 minute walk away 
421837,citizenM Amsterdam, Toilet missing a brush Toilet paper could have been a little more softer , Good value for money friendly and helpful staff Rooms are neat and modern and also quite for a good night sleep 
421838,citizenM Amsterdam, After a day i would smell the sewerage kind of smell in the room Exhaust fans should be improved , The staff were very gracious and they made you feel at home 
421839,citizenM Amsterdam, A little pricey for a Saturday but I understand why I was disappointed that I could not open window It was hot and I felt like I was in a space capsule I m a fresh air gal , Absolutely
421840,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing I didn t like just wished the AC would cool down quicker Not a deal breaker whatsoever things were wonderful The hotel hospitality did recommend a restaurant called Restaurant AS but I would not recommend it It was 9pm when I walked over along with some others and we were rudely turned away with the excuse that they were all booked up They are open until 11pm and there was nobody inside All patrons were seated outside so it did not make sense Totally shocked Everyone is typically so wonderful in Amsterdam , The bed sheets were perfect like sleeping on a cloud The shower was like relaxing under a waterfall On top of all that the hotel hospitality was impeccable 
421841,citizenM Amsterdam, Too far from the city centre 10 tram stops took around 25 minutes the open plan shower was okay but not sure the toilet needs to be too , Modern design very clean room and great staff
421842,citizenM Amsterdam, The food selection at citizen M in Amsterdam is poor there s not very much to choose from and the stuff that is available is strange food no normal food or any hot options simple food would have been much appreciated I do appreciate that it isn t in the uk but some uk foods would not go a miss in my opinion with the amount of British tourists that were there The rooms are nice and modern however the facilities in the rooms are pretty scarce fridge wardrobe AC for example could only go to 18 degrees but the room felt w lot hotter than that which caused some discomfort It is a good thing the public transport in Amsterdam is very good as the hotel is quite a while away from the town centre and there is nothing near by the hotel like shops restaurants coffee shops ect My girlfriend and I are very comfortable with each other so didn t mind much about the toilet and shower being in pods in the middle of the room but I imagine other couples who are more reserved would have an issue with that, Comfy bed decent selection on the TV with on demand content I have stayed at this hotel before back in March and booked again for the previous stay so it was good enough for me to come back a second time However I would not book up again the next time I come back to Amsterdam 
421843,citizenM Amsterdam, There was nothing I didn t like, How welcoming it was the best nights sleep I ve had ever because the bed was so comfortable and spacious staff were excellent
421844,citizenM Amsterdam, The rooms suit single people or couples who know each other well as the shower and toilet are cubicles in the room and not separate We didn t mind at all but some people might , This is a great modern hotel It is in a quiet location away from the main tourist areas but an easy tram ride into the Center Only a 5 minute train ride from Schiphol airport as well They had good free bikes to use and the food is outstanding 
421845,citizenM Amsterdam, No bath tub , Deborah was alley employee that made my stay wonderful To the point that when I returned a few days latter I booked this hotel again instead f a hotel with a bathtub
421846,citizenM Amsterdam, N A, The room layout was different and quirky The facilities in the hotel were great and I liked the interior design of the hotel I also loved the self service check in and check out desks 
421847,citizenM Amsterdam, Shops near Hotel are unfortunately closed on weekend Rooms were cleaned unfortunately every day less Perhaps we have given too little tip , check in makes the guest itself which we found good because it s very fast Staff is available when needed We were there before check in time That was no problem Rooms in reality just like the official pictures Just something differently Great exactly for us the right Room at check in very clean Staff all very friendly By tram you can drive fast in the City
421848,citizenM Amsterdam, Everything is perfect , Very nice and modern hotel Bed very confortable and every thing you need you can find Staff very kindly This Hotel is near train station and bus station I would like to say thank you to your italian assistant Chiara for help us to organize this holiday 
421849,citizenM Amsterdam, that I could not open the window We re in Amsterdam one of the cleanest cities in the world on a calm spot Please make windows that can be opened We re obliged to sleep with airconditionning claustrophobic room which odd for a 4 hotel, ambiance furniture
421850,citizenM Amsterdam, The prices at the bar were steep but compared to the other city centre bars it wasn t too bad especially considering there wasn t much choice in the local area It didn t put us off going back at all , We hadn t been to a CitizenM hotel before but after reading some other reviews we decided to give it a go The staff were beyond helpful the room was fantastic the location was about 25 minutes walk from the City Centre and the extras in the room free movies lighting in the shower etc made the trip perfect 
421851,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Bed is huge and the technology is a nice gimmick However the room style with the shower and toilet not segregated off in a traditional style means that privacy could be an issue for some couples Free movies too are good after a long day sightseeing
421852,citizenM Amsterdam, If you have two people in a hotel room you d better be really close or a couple as the rooms are literally a king size bed wide and the shower glass is transparent This would be called a studio or efficiency based on my NYC POV Eating in the area can be a little bit of a pain as its not immediately apparent that theres anything to eat o get delivered especially at night There was a SINGLE staff member that was consistently cold and abrupt couldn t tell if s he was being rude or if it was simply a cultural difference , The 15 euro breakfasts may seem steep but they re filled with quality coffee pastries and smoked salmon The breakfast was a god send considering I was going to a music festival every morning The staff were extremely helpful and polite They were helpful in a friendly instead of clinical way They offer complimentary bikes were a nice touch get them early they get rented out quickly The beds were large firm and very comfortable The LED showers and toilets are a nice touch but uh very intimate 
421853,citizenM Amsterdam, A little bit closer to Amsterdam city centre would have been nice but the tram stop is just outside the hotel so this isn t a real problem , The staff were absolutely fantastic Genuinely friendly helpful and enthusiastic The room was immaculate well presented and very clean and futuristic Thanks for making my first trip to Amsterdam a memorable one CitizenM you re awesome 
421854,citizenM Amsterdam, The room design is original but not so practical Shelves would have been welcome rather that a huge unique drawer Be sure to be extremely intimate if you share the room with a friend Controlling everything TV light window shutters with iPad is fancy but a good old switch would be easier sometimes , Good location outside the center but with direct train or tram Great staff always available and smiling The bar and eating facilities are just wonderful have a try at the Indonesian cook dishes 
421855,citizenM Amsterdam, They haven t bike enough for customer The quater is unsecured keep attention at your car Someone broke in my car and the only things the hotel did was giving to me a map for the police station , Coffee is good
421856,citizenM Amsterdam, The space in the room is very limited If you stayed for a few days and brought a suitcase there would be nowhere to put it The space available used in the best possible way though drawers under bed storage space bathroom area the thin safe And at least the bed is huge , The staff were all extremely friendly helpful and attentive The good quality of amenities and furnishings The i pad to control everything in the room The very high standard of cleanliness 
421857,citizenM Amsterdam, quiet area bikes need to be back by midnight, Free bikes included with stay 24 hour bar free movies free porn movies too free updated computers free wifi very friendly staff microwave available as are all cutlery and plates right in the lounge area perfect 
421858,citizenM Amsterdam, Room hadn t been cleaned properly dust and cup glass rings on desk staff offered us a room change but I d already cleaned so was happy to stay we were offered a free breakfast as an apology Rooms are a little cramped but adequate for short breaks Would ve preferred to have tea coffee making facilities in room but staff where happy to provide hot water A little fridge would be a good idea too , Staff brilliant friendly and couldn t be more helpful Free use of bikes Free WiFi and use of computers Super comfy bed Daughter loved the Star Trek shower Comfy seating areas in main hotel area Safe storage for luggage after check out so we could spend the day sightseeing before an evening flight 
421859,citizenM Amsterdam, small rooms unconventional toilet and shower cubical good for singles or couples sharing even that the room is a bit small for 2, Nice comfy beds cool gadgets nice shower fun lobby with excellent cocktails
421860,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, I am an older person not tech savvy the staff were great and did not make me feel inferior for not understanding everything I really enjoyed this place 
421861,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Finally a hotel that understands what a room needs Good bed Good curtains Free movies Simplicity rather than unwanted unhandy gadgets or so called design things 
421862,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Good location sophisticated design Friendly staff To Raymond Thank you for your hospitality great and always very kind approach to us and for everyday smile Keep on learning polish language Dank U
421863,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing but it might be considered too far out of the buzz for some people but an unlimited 48hr travel pass at 12 50 gets you anywhere in the city , Situated slightly out of the city centre but steps from the no 5 tram stop a route which takes you past all the attractions enroute to central station it s also steps from Amsterdam Zuid station The rooms are quirky and pod like and the bar and lounge areas are also modern and quirky 
421864,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Great hotel with a modern and hip design Easy to get to the city centre with the tram 5 which is just in front of the hotel Very big and comfortable bed Great in room media system

421867,citizenM Amsterdam, Couldn t fault anything, My husband and I have just retuned home from 3 nights away in Amsterdam and would highly recommend The hotel is 1 tram stop way from the airport so around 5 minutes away then a short walk of around 5 10 mins to the hotel Checking in was easy we arrived a few hours before checking in time but were able to access our room The hotel and rooms are very modern with furniture and decor to match everywhere was clean and tidy staff very friendly the room included a hair dryer bottled water soap shower gel shampoo and a complimentry safe too The bed was quite possibly the comfiest bed I ve ever slept in and was huge An iPad was also included to control the air con lights blinds and TV which was a nice touch too We didn t eat at the hotel as wanted to explore what Amsterdam had to offer but looked very popular when we went past There is a tram stop appox 5 mins away from the hotel we found this the cheapest way to get about these come past every 5 10 mins this takes around 15 mins to the area of Museums and a further 10 minutes to Central Station Was a really wonderful trip to CitizenM Hotel Amsterdam 
421868,citizenM Amsterdam, Some of you will consider the room is small it is compact Best if you consider it just for nighttime things sleeping watching a movie etc and chill out in the lounge bar downstairs , The room is designed for a great nights sleep Massive comfortable bed blinds and window shades that make the room dark insulated walls that make it completely quiet 24 hour food and coffee in the spacious relaxing lounge downstairs Super clean and very friendly staff Close to airport one train stop and close enough to the main attractions by tram 
421869,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Amazing modern hotel perfect in every details Staff absolutely cute it was our honeymoon and i send it an email for let them know and they prepared a nice bedroom and the offer us 2 cocktails Amazing They give you for free even the bike wich is so important in Amsterdam The best was the breakfast buffet soo good 
421870,citizenM Amsterdam, It could be made clearer on the website that anyone travelling by train from Schipol should use Amsterdam Zuid station which is five minutes walk from the hotel we got the train to Amsterdam Centraal and had to pay a further 30 euros in a taxi to get to the hotel If you are staying for a few days invest in a travelcard for all public transport which are available from Zuid station and are very handy for getting about the city , Staff were very friendly rooms have very modern facilities although on the small side if you have more than carry on luggage with you
421871,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing comes to mind , Great atmosphere and friendly staff waiting to help you The style of this hotel is amazing and will give you something to talk about kinda alien futuristic Clean and organized room with an interesting shower toilet inside what my friend and I called a glass space pod haha Great venue for concert goers due to proximity to Amsterdam Arena 
421872,citizenM Amsterdam, No everything was perfect , We loved everything about our stay and would highly recommend staying with CitizenM in Amsterdam central location Everything was top quality and the staff were fantastic 
421873,citizenM Amsterdam, very hard bed could not open the window of the room old linen, the 24 7 possibility for food and beverage the media possibilities in the room decoration
421874,citizenM Amsterdam, I liked pretty much everything about the venue and the rooms except when I arrived and was trying to check in It was my first time travelling solo I had changed all my money to euro and had most of it in cash I assumed there won t be any issues using cash and it will help me keep good track of my spending I had everything in check except the travel agent booking com failed to inform me that the hotel only allows checking in with cards I had arrived at the hotel at 22 00 and I no banks were open My only option was to contact my parents back in London to transfer money to my account They did and it was quite a hassle because I had to call my bank and have it sorted out It was such a hassle and such a nuisance I have to point out that aside from that I did enjoy my stay It was clean quiet and the rooms are unique so it gave me a pleasant new experience , The quiet the unique rooms the service the comfy beds and friendly staff 
421875,citizenM Amsterdam, Had to pay in advance Online payment did not work Got locked out of room I do not like toilets and shower in same room as bed Pornography displayed as art Shower tray was unstable and dangerous A bit chlostrophobic in bed rooms just too small , Staff tried very hard to be helpful and were charming Good downstairs spaces 
421876,citizenM Amsterdam, The hotel doesn t store bags overnight in case you ve checked out and want to leave them there, Really easy to check in and check out thorough Self service 
421877,citizenM Amsterdam, Toilet time can be intimate The shower and toilet are in StarTrek style beam me up cubicles If your with your nearest and dearest then shower not a problem But numbers 2 s may put any relationship to the test , Staff are fantastic Super cool hotel Spotless 
421878,citizenM Amsterdam, a little pricey perhaps some sort of discount for frequent stayers or should I say permanent residents , the stuff extremely friendly always smiling and ready to help location is fabulous will be back in the near future i m sure 
421879,citizenM Amsterdam, It could have been better if there is a fridge in the room and a flat iron to use, The staff are nice and very attentive to our needs Tamara at reception is very nice and approachable 
421880,citizenM Amsterdam, The property is packed like every single inch is utilized made me feel no room to breath from how optimized it But it s the style of this model , The property is very business oriented for couples I don t find it good enough 
421881,citizenM Amsterdam, Breakfast is quite expensive Rooms are only really for single occupancy The shower and toilet in the middle of the room would make privacy an issue However lovely hotel all the same , Good location if working in the Zuid Rooms are clean and comfortable for one person and the staff are always friendly and accommodating 
421882,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, The employees were super friendly mega helpful and had us laughing at the bar in the early hours We were made to feel very welcome and at ease from the offset The bed was the comfiest bed I ve ever slept in I loved the mood lighting in the rooms the overall decor of the the hotel and great facilities The location was perfect for us a short walk to Le Pijp and 15mins on the tram to Centraal Station I will definitely be staying again 
421883,citizenM Amsterdam, A little more space in the bedroom would have been good that said the room was so cool and i loved the mood lighting, The staff were super friendly and helpful The wifi was excellent and the macs provided in the lounge area where brilliant for helping us plan the next part of our trip The hotel has a fantastic feel about it 
421884,citizenM Amsterdam, Breakfast is very modest with very limited options of the food One type of ham 2 types of cheese omlette fried tomatoes and boiled eggs are not fair for the high price of accomodation For the such accomodation price the breakfast should be free of charge included into the price of staying , Hotel is located very close to the railway station near fantastic park and very close to the airport 15 minutes to reach the place Free Internet facilities near reception 4 PCs free printer and password free Wi Fi 
421885,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, You know what to expect with Citizen M clean simple rooms with a little fun aspect The common areas are always well furnished and there is a good mix of people The location is close to Amsterdam South station
421886,citizenM Amsterdam, Lack of hanging space for clothes , The size and comfort of the beds are a bonus Only downside is the hanging space for clothes but bonus that they have a ironing room 
421887,citizenM Amsterdam, A little guidance on how to buy a tram ticket which tram to catch and where to eat near to the Hotel in a simple one sheet handout would really help It didn t ruin our trip but it could have made it a lot easier , Clean comfortable and great staff
421888,citizenM Amsterdam, Unable to open window in the room as I like a fresh air breeze , Great location as it was not right in the centre of the city but very quick and easy to get to Loved how funky and clean the room was Friendly smiley staff around if you need them Did not eat in the hotel as we where always out but did get lovely coffees to go each morning which was quick and convenient 
421889,citizenM Amsterdam, Laborious self check in process not what you want after a long journey Concierge unable to offer simple services such as airport pick up 15 page required to understand how do basic things like turn on lights or activate the shower No facilities such as gym or pool at the hotel Food very expensive , Handy location for the conference centre Big comfy beds 
421890,citizenM Amsterdam, One or two drawers or shelving for clothing items , Overall service and willingness of the entire CitizenM team to assist 24 x 7 with practically anything including getting around train departure times etc
421891,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing , The room is really interesting and clean Though the hotel is not really near to the city centre it still very convenient to the centre if you rent a bike from the hotel for free or take a No 5 tram just in front of the hotel The staff there are quite enthusiastic and friendly Especially my friend got some problems they showed concern to my friend and helped us to figure problems as well Thanks for the help and understanding We really love the stay in the hotel 
421892,citizenM Amsterdam, The hotel is a little out of the town There is a tram stop just outside and free bikes are available so it s not too much of an issue , Lovely hotel nice bar Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful Rooms was clean with all free movies which was a nice surprise 
421893,citizenM Amsterdam, The shower won t turn on until you shut the cubicle door this can mean it will be freezing water that you re trapped in until it it s warm That s all I can think of , The bed was an absolute dream The room does look a little small until you re on the bed The staff were AMAZING Couldn t do enough for us so attentive and friendly Right next to a train station tram station and bus stops Great location 
421894,citizenM Amsterdam, All of the bikes available for use were the same size a bit too big for a girl 5 4 Slightly further out of the city than I expected no where within walking distance to grab a meal or groceries the business in the world trade centre were closed on weekends Linens and floor in our room were dirty and weren t changed or cleaned when housekeeping was in to make the bed and provide towels Shower knobs were quite difficult to turn Information about the surrounding area with restaurants groceries laundry and transit info in the room would have been helpful, Fantastic fantastic meals provided About 16 euros for all you can eat from the self serve family style meals Loved all the sitting lounge space downstairs and the atmosphere of everyone hanging out downstairs Bikes available for use lots within a 5 minute bike ride and a staff member recommended a nice food hall farmers market area to go iPad controlled room lots of TV options Close to a main metro line
421895,citizenM Amsterdam, Only disadvantage I had was the disruption of the wireless connection between smart phone and TV There was a technical fault accross the hotel which disabled the use of connecting our phones to the TV during our stay , I don t normally write reviews but I had to take time to compliment the service I received at this hotel My friend and I came to Amsterdam for a weekend to attend a concert Out of all the accommodations I ve stayed at in Amsterdam CitezenM by far has been the best First of all the decor and layout of the hotel is superb Using space very efficiently and keeping a very modern vibe going on across the whole hotel Secondly the room is just so amazing The cylinder tube shower and toilet were so cute the bed was huge and comfortable and there was enough space for a safe coat hangers and a storage for the suitcases Strong WIFI accross the hotel was a bonus too which my friend desperately needed at times The mood lightings were my favourite part and being able to control the lights blinds Tv and heating all from the tips of my fingers accross the provided iPad was just bliss The staff were all so polite Each one of them always had a smile and acknowledged us whilst they walked past keeping contact to a minimal to prevent annoyance but with just the right amount of attention when we needed it Even the cleaners were happy and you can t say that for many hotels I enjoyed my stay here and I would highly recommend to all my friends which I have started to do so already Thank you CitezenM
421896,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Hotel was super modern love the pods for the toilet and the shower Comfiest hotel bed and the iPad mini to control everything was a lovely touch Close to the centre but also close to the train station which was perfect Staff were very friendly and always happy to help
421897,citizenM Amsterdam, Bathroom in the room dripping suddenly sometime in the middle of the night and waking me up Very small room without enough space to hang clothes or store luggage Too expensive for what it offers , Comfortable bed very quiet excellent location close to RAI All room controls are through a tablet but it takes some time to get used to it 
421898,citizenM Amsterdam, Room is small good for 1 person , Very nice location not in busy downtown area but a quiet residential area next to train station and tram stop very conveniet 10 min to airport by train 20 min to central station by tram 5 Nice staff Ready to answer all you questions 
421899,citizenM Amsterdam, room could be slightly more spacious, technology based futuristic less interruption from staff since mostly self service in all aspects clean and tidy basic amenities
421900,citizenM Amsterdam, Having the toilet and shower incorporated in the room is something we needed some time to get used to It also took us some time to get to terms with the technological controls of the room I imagine it would be quite a challenge for some people especially older I guess the whole thing is designed for younger people The room was rather small with little wardrobe space The breakfast was so expensive we didn t even try it , It was very well connected and the staff were friendly and helpful The design of the hotel makes it attractive The use of technology makes it quite practical 
421901,citizenM Amsterdam, The room is extremely small TV and the bathroom were broken in the first room We were offered to change the room A free meal was granted as a compensation but a quick look at sent us immediately to the nearest fish restaurant The price is too high for this accommodation , Location is good The hotel is not far from the center 3 km The bed is wide and comfortable The electric shatter blocks the light from the window and helps you have a long sleep 
421902,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, This was basically just used for sleeping I ate and drank in the centre of Amsterdam however it was a great hotel with very good staff would stay here again 
421903,citizenM Amsterdam, Needed more space for storing things The big drwaer for luggage was fine but without a wardrobe or chest of drawers there really was no where to unpack clothes except for 4 hangers , Modern and very functional
421904,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing bad to write about hotel , Very friendly staff Great bar and good food Enjoyed walk into centre of Amsterdam stopping off in various neighbourhood bars for a drink 
421905,citizenM Amsterdam, Rooms a little small and also pricey for what is effectively a travel lodge type hotel , Friendly staff nice bar and tram stop across the road Only 10 mins by tram to Van Gogh museum and 5 min walk to train station for train to schipol airport 10mins 
421906,citizenM Amsterdam, Rooms are really small the way the bathroom is organized is quite unpractical Monitoring the lights and curtains through Ipad is fancy but not always convenient in the middle of the night , Trendy hotel friendly multicultural staff
421907,citizenM Amsterdam, Tea and coffee facilities in the rooms would help purchasing them from the bar is just another expense, Great room Very comfortable Easy to get to Short tram ride to the centre
421908,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Nice location near the centrum of the city but apart the crowds in the centrum Beutiful park and wonderful restaurangs just around the corner Modern hotell clean and nice personal 
421909,citizenM Amsterdam, The fact that colleagues who booked after me paid half the price The no outside food policy in the lobby Witnessed this twice with other people and your staff For such a chill place a very unnecessary rule , The overall concept

421911,citizenM Amsterdam, The only thing was the bed Being a mature couple it was difficult getting in and out of bed however we met the challenge , The staff were fantastic friendly and helpful especially Henri Inez Theo Thomas and many more just don t know their names Great atmosphere Lovely hotel loved the shower 
421912,citizenM Amsterdam, The hotel has a set design for the rooms and they are small but work well You have to like having a shower in a glass tube and the same for the toilet You really have to use the public space as there is no space in the room to lounge The room is as wide as the bed I could not figure out how they made the beds , It was very close to the conference centre at the RAI It was very clean and functional Staff were great and the bar and food area was really comfortable and enjoyable 
421913,citizenM Amsterdam, em can t think of anything bad , from the excellent reception service on arrival to service during our stay and on checking out all very lovely friendly staff first class will definitely staff again in Citizen M
421914,citizenM Amsterdam, It s a bit expensive but all the hotels are very expensive in Amsterdam , The rooms are very stylish and clean The staff was super friendly Very lively hotel 
421915,citizenM Amsterdam, I booked a double room but I was not aware that the toilets were in the very same room there is just one glass door that separates them for the room You can hear and see people through the glass while they are in the WC no intimacy whatsoever If you are on your own in the room is ok but for 2 is NOT ok , Location is just perfect next to the tramway 5 that takes you to the most important places in the city Staff were amazing They were always happy and willing to help they were very proactive Nice breakfast Clean and confortable facilities
421916,citizenM Amsterdam, No self service coffee machine , Very nice fast helpful and smiling staff Modern design and extravagant rooms Do not take away the charm and the great atmosphere at the hotel Breakfast is delicious warm bread and very good coffee The bar is open 24 hours a day Large lobby where you will feel at home Quiet residential area Access to the parking lot Electric car charging under the hotel Very good location of the hotel close to the tram and the train station and the airport Here you want to come back soon

421918,citizenM Amsterdam, The room is little and if it is for two does not allow any provacy Bedroom and bathroon have a separation of a thin trasparent door Wardrobe is almost nothing you have to fit all your clothes in a big drower under the bed There are multiple plugs in but actually just one for Europe that means you can plug in either the phone or the pc or the ipad or the camera not what you expect travelling All of that is acceptable for an hostel of high quality not for an hotel of prices as 4stars, The personal of the hotel is nice and helps in all they can The location far from the center but in a nice area Wifi free and accessible in any part of the hotel 
421919,citizenM Amsterdam, The modular pod like room with the bathroom and shower units IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM was awkward lacking in privacy and cramped , The carpet was nice 
421920,citizenM Amsterdam, I didn t love that the toilet was enclosed by a semi opaque capsule , The wall to wall bed was amazing The room was run by an iPad mini and had so many fun options Black out shades for sleeping were fantastic and we didn t hear any street or hotel noises It was so easy to check ourselves in on one of the kiosks and activate our own room keys 
421921,citizenM Amsterdam, The see through toilet, Bed was amazingly comfy toilet in bedroom wasn t very private at all need to be a pretty comfortable couple to use those haha Showers were amaaaaaaazing Not that much storage in rooms Staff 100 amazing customer service Especially Emma and inez

421923,citizenM Amsterdam, I thought the rooms were very compact and small which is fine for a city trip when you aren t in room for long although others may find that not so comfortable , I loved the sleekness of checking in yourself as long as u were OK with technology and that our rooms were already ready before 2pm The cocktail bar was fab for coffees in the morning and lovely cocktails at night it was fresh and vibrant and a few times we bought a croissant to go which was lovely and ideal for us to be able to do that with a busy day planned Beds also extremely comfy

421926,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Great location for us 5 min walk from Zuid station 10 mins on a tram to the city centre Nice quiet location but still close enough if you walk to the centre you can stumble across lots of great little places to eat and drink 
421927,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing, The bed was extremely comfy the staff were excellent when we queried the fact that the city tax needed to be paid as not done through booking com easy self service check in and out and the hotel was easy to find and close to tram and train station I would definitely stay here again 
421928,citizenM Amsterdam, what was to dislike I found nothing I didn t like, the whole experience was first rate the staff should be commended they always went that extra and so friendly
421929,citizenM Amsterdam, Payment only by credit card Hairs in shower and on the floor No possibility to open a window Air condition is automatic not possible to turn it off and i get very serious sick after one night there Room is extra small No closed to put close and shoes must leave a luggage direkt in the middle of the room Shower and toilet with glas door what makes discomfort , Reception
421930,citizenM Amsterdam, Not a very wide range of choice or variety for breakfast or dinner , Fantastic Staff who were friendly enthusiastic and dedicated to making our stay as pleasant as possible Concept of room keycard which could be used to pay for food and drinks Fully itemised receipt on checkout as well as email copy sent to my in box Great transport links to the centre of with tickets available in Hotel 
421931,citizenM Amsterdam, Coffee Tea making facilities in room , Liked it being convenient for tram and metro iPad control mood lighting big comfy bed Modern decor 24hr food drink very friendly staff Apple Macs in Reception area 
421932,citizenM Amsterdam, More storage space in room would be good Breakfast service a little chaotic when crowded due to having to go to bar , Wonderful bed Staff pleasant and helpful Room quiet and calm Interesting design and comfortable stylish communal areas Easy access to centre of town with tram Great cocktails 
421933,citizenM Amsterdam, Only one chair in room Rooms a bit tight Space for clothes scant storage not easily reached , Communal areas Wifi good Staff lovely Check in out good no time wasted Food and bar service good 
421934,citizenM Amsterdam, The blindes and the blackout were not enough to sleep in the dark The air was too dry The shower knob didn t turn properly I could hear the noise in the corridor,No Positive
421935,citizenM Amsterdam, The toilet was too close for comfort Room very small Had to get a tram into town took 20 mins, I loved the interior both in room and lobby area very helpful staff quite rooms
421936,citizenM Amsterdam, New concept Room with strange shower loo set up not that good Lengthy tram ride to city centre , Clean staff very pleasant Easy access to tram for city centre but
421937,citizenM Amsterdam, Breakfast choice No option for only scrambles eggs for example Would have been charged 16 95e but I fo believe this is an amsterdam issue with most hotel doing the same, Unique rooms all the same nice decor and relax atmosphere
421938,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Funky and fun Amazing beds Great concept hotel iPad controls had the teenagers in raptures as did the enormous TV mood lighting open plan shower Even the blinds are entertaining The staff are young and amazingly helpful The food is basic but what there is is well done I have put the location as good only because it is out from the centre HOWEVER the tram system in Amsterdam is fantastically efficient and has a stop right by the hotel Very good value for money 
421939,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, From the time I arrived the staff was amazingly helpful My room immaculate great accommodations close to rail and trolley Great bar and excellent food offerings 
421940,citizenM Amsterdam, Location is slightly out of the centre so this means you need to get a 30 minute tram into the centre , Very clean and modern Like that the entire room is controlled by an iPad Comfy bed and a nice hot shower 
421941,citizenM Amsterdam, Expensive breakfast especially for a child having only cereals Extremely expensive parking unless using the discount system which in a nightmare take a bus to the tram station take the tram to downtown take a tram back to the parking at olympic stadium all this with a young child and your suitcases and then use your tram ticket within one hour to get the parking discount Crazy , Nice room location convenient to take a train into downtown 
421942,citizenM Amsterdam, No comments , Hotel room was amazing and the cocktails are by far the nicest I have had Could not fault our hotel room for a small space it is used perfectly Nothing negative to say 
421943,citizenM Amsterdam, Lack of coffee maker in room but there is a nice coffee bar in the hotel If traveling with someone else might have been bothered by the lack of privacy Only serious complaint is the booking process not the fault of CitizenM I thought I had prepaid for the room which was implied by the confirmation email which said that my card could be charged anytime after the booking but it turned out not to be the case so I was unexpectedly stuck with a fee for using a credit card onsite Booking com should do a better job of clarifying when a room is prepaid and when not , Staff exceptionally helpful and available 24 7 Room was small but functional and comfortable The iPad control system worked well and was fun to use Hotel is close to Schiphol the Amsterdam Zuid train metro station and the VUmc Easy trip to city centre with 5 or 24 bus Very nice public areas on the ground floor 
421944,citizenM Amsterdam, The standard room for me was personally quite small and there was not a lot of room to move around the toilet was also in the middle of the room and offered no privacy at all if you are sharing the room although this cannot be changed as this is the layout of the room it is not a complaint it is just a word of warning to those who are travelling with friends partners that you cannot go to the toilet with any privacy unless you ask them to leave the room if not they will be able to hear everything lol through a frosted glass door just like the shower when i booked this hotel i could not see any pictures of the toilet in the room however please note the toilet is exactly the same as the shower but just on the other side with frosted glass if you would not be comfortable with this then i would not opt to choose this hotel however me and my partner didn t mind , After landing at amsterdam airport we took the train to ZUID took around 5 minutes hotel was then a 5 minute walk away Location was around a 15 minute tram ride into central amsterdam perfect if you are visiting for leisure and to see the attractions e g coffee shops red light district just ask for directions to TRAM 5 from hotel 2 minute walk lovely room absolutely spotless comfy bed amazing shower amazing choice of movies to watch some very new releases hotel staff extremely friendly and happy to help with anything we paid for a late checkout and were able to have the room until 4pm that day for 29 euros quiet hotel with no noisy distractions perfect for young couple visiting amsterdam for the first time 
421945,citizenM Amsterdam, Too pricey vs what s offered rooms are rather small , Cool hotel concept especially if you re a geek Convenient location not in the centre but a few tram stops from Museumplein close to Zuid station 
421946,citizenM Amsterdam, Rooms are tiny only for one person Open toilet area with opaque sliding circular doors okay but bathroom smells permeate the room Yuck Beds are horribly hard you might as well sleep on the floor , Good food offerings very friendly helpful staff 
421947,citizenM Amsterdam, The room was quite cold We ve asked to hotel staff but they ve said everything was ok Hotel room starts to show some need of refresh especially the shower kind of mold present Electric curtain really noisy Not very good aviation isolation you can clearly hear the conversation of people walking in the corridor Quite expensive vs space and services offered , Good position colse to city center A tram stop is located just outside the hotel 
421948,citizenM Amsterdam, The space lighting TV and wall 2 wall bed so hi tech but too capsule for a couple that wishes to sit somewhere except their bed It took us some extra time to decode the facilities and equipment using the I Pad The shower knobs need weight lifters to switch them on off The clothing rack not enough for 2 people unless they travel with what they wear and one shirt more The solarium style shower toilet makes the place a bit more noisy than it should be Think the concept is brilliant could work better if the hotel improve the internal facilities and equipment , The ambient was very modern and friendly and the staff so kind and helpful I would stay again but traveling for business and not for leisure since rooms are fit to solo travelers 
421949,citizenM Amsterdam, Free tea and coffee in the rooms should be a must in any hotel I don t believe it would not be an appropriate stay for families , Its a nice hotel very modern in the new financial district High tech rooms with a tablet driving everything corridors that look like storage units Well worth the experience
421950,citizenM Amsterdam, Check in staff were rude and Even though I d booked 2 rooms I couldn t pay for them together which meant I incurred two lots of credit card charges, Location cleanliness of room and standard of room were all good
421951,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, I couldn t fault a single thing My boyfriend and I arrived in Amsterdam on Friday and the staff couldn t have been more welcoming or helpful The hotel was immaculate loved the quirky interior design We were very impressed with the room as it was a perfect size for a couple and loved that you could control everything from the mood lighting to the blinds and television through the IPad Location is brilliant tram stop number 5 was right outside our hotel which allows you to go all the way to centraal station and Zuid Station was a 5 minute walk at the very most The worst part was having to check out not because it was stressful it was the easiest procedure of checking in and out that i have ever experienced but because we had to leave Thank you for having us CitizenM we will definitely be back in the near future 
421952,citizenM Amsterdam, The room is not convenient Storage of clothes beneath the bed hardly any space for the luggage nor to work in the room , The bar area is very nice The staff is also very good 
421953,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Fabulous style and decor Lovely staff really helpful Such tasty breakfasts and varied choice of snacks Easy to travel in and out of City via the tram V V easy to get there on the train from Schipol
421954,citizenM Amsterdam, Quite far from the city though tram line is very near in the hotel Room is very small , Very clean and modern hotel facilities are quite good staffs are helpul
421955,citizenM Amsterdam, The bed was incredibly firm too much for us which could just be down to personal preference It s seemed all the cleaning staff did in our room after the first say is take the rubbish out nothing else Despite us leaving our towels on the floor to be changed , Staff were super friendly and always ready to anwser any questions we had The rooms were trendy and modern and added another thing to see on our holiday 
421956,citizenM Amsterdam, The rooms are quite small what with the bath facilities being in enclosed columns in the main and only room For a single traveler I d consider this an excellent hotel For two people with two suitcases it was a bit tight , This hotel has won design awards and it s easy to see why Very modern looking and stylish with many neat features Probably the best design of any hotel I ve been in Love those mood lights Best list of TV stations in German French English Spanish Italian and of course Dutch Very reasonably priced buffet dinner not too many choices but enough 
421957,citizenM Amsterdam, Very small room windows can not be open a bit far from the city center 30 min by tram about 1 h and 30 min by foot , Very nice staff comfortable bed
421958,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff throughout our stay at the hotel were really friendly approachable and helpful couldn t fault any of them The rooms made a good use of the space with all modern amenities loved the funky mood lighting and the bed was amazingly big comfy The Zuid train station is a 2 minute walk away with a 5 minute train journey to the airport Catch the train from outside the hotel for a 5 10 minute journey to some of the main tourist attractions within the city centre I would definitely recommend the hotel to others 
421959,citizenM Amsterdam, Unlike the London Citizen M which had a wide selection there was no scrummy food available on our arrival at lunchtime apart from microwaveable items The location was way out of town 25 mins on a tram , The staff were wonderful and really warm and helpful The breakfast was brilliant The rooms as ever were fab 
421960,citizenM Amsterdam, The location of the hotel seems best suited for business travelers who have affairs meetings at the nearby conference center or office buildings Otherwise the neighborhood is a bit off the usual tourist pathways It s not hard to catch a tram to get to the museums or touristy areas of town but it s not the best choice for tourists who want a home base that is closer to the center of town where the most popular sights of Amsterdam are , Friendly service and cozy room full of thoughtful and playful details It was kind of mind blowing to have a room with tube like glass chambers for the toilet and shower it was a clever unusual detail that made a tiny room seem much bigger I also liked the big drawer under the bed easy to store clothes and various souvenir buys there Having a small desk nearby to do work was very handy too The bed was super comfy and the room was quiet a welcome oasis after a 9 hour flight from India Very cool to have options for mood lighting and music controlled by the ipad near the bedstand Breakfast and the downstairs cantina bar was excellent all you can eat scrambled eggs and roasted tomatoes bacon bread or granola and yogurt Worth ordering ahead of time since they charge more if you just get it on the day of The open fridge with beers sodas and snacks was also a cut above and very convenient especially since it seemed like the next closest convenience store was at the Amsterdam Zuid station about a 10 minute walk away The bar and the living room area was great for socializing and relaxing I felt 20 hipper by staying at Citizen M The hotel is conveniently located near the Amsterdam Zuid train and metro stations it s a quick one stop ride from the airport It was also a good home base when I did a day trip to s Hertogenbosch The staff kindly took good care of my suitcases while i was off on my day trip and provided excellent friendly service every step of the way 
421961,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, I cannot fault this hotel atal Staff were so pleasant made a great effort very helpful Wifi was free rooms so clean amsterdam is an expensive place to go so in general hotel wasnt to expensive Rooms can be controled manually or with an ipad there for you Its out of town but the tram is right next to hotel takes you right into town central Would deff recommend this hotel
421962,citizenM Amsterdam, The only minor thing that would have been better was if there was music CDs actually available on the iPad there was a cool graphic of lots of CD covers but it wasn t actual CDs just the radio graphic , The bed is gorgeously huge white and clean the room was controlled by iPad very quiet great selection of films all free cleaned every day loved it all
421963,citizenM Amsterdam, Continental breakfast being the only option , The overall atmosphere and setting was better than we expected Really enjoyed how different the hotel is to the norm This hotel topped off our stay in Amsterdam and we would definitely recommend it and have recommended it 
421964,citizenM Amsterdam, The bed was really spacious but unfortunately not verry soft and comfortable , Lovely modern room with a twist The small space was used and decorated very wisely 
421965,citizenM Amsterdam, The only thing I d say is the rooms were not cleaned properly every day i e no clean sheets bed not made properly and was definitely not dusted however the actual hotel lobby etc was spotless , The bed was one of the comfiest I have stayed in The check in out self service was a much easier way as opposed to the old fashioned way Apple Mac computers and printer to use for free of charge this was handy as we had boarding passes to print from the few dealings we had with staff they seemed really friendly also the steam room which was a self service ironing room was also really handy this is free to use Overall I d say CitizenM is really funky and cool hotel 
421966,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Hotel room is wonderful Modern and quirky All controlled by an ipad lighting alarm blinds TV The bed was HUGE and really comfy Staff were so very friendly would recommend to everyone 
421967,citizenM Amsterdam, The loo in the middle of the room is only for couples who are comfortable performing in front of each other there is no place to hide , The location was great on a direct tram line number 5 from the central station very easy to find The staff were really friendly and helpful there was a fun upbeat vibe around the hotel which felt energizing The rooms were fun with the colourful lighting and unusual layout the bed was comfortable and huge the pillows were as soft as advertised and the food was lush 
421968,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, At first I was surprised by the room setting but the gadgets and the bed were really great and comfortable The fact that toilet was there in the room was a bit inconvenient because of the noise but the shower idea was good If you are going as a couple I think its fine I loved the room controls and the fact that you could also watch some movies that were not on TV Also the fact that you could change lights based on different moods was also interesting The tram stop is really close and you can take number 5 and it takes you to most tourit attractions museums and city centre 
421969,citizenM Amsterdam, only a personal preference the room was a little claustrophobic as you can t open the window which would have been nice , everything was done well Apple mac s to use for checking emails printer available made boarding passes easy to arrange Breakfast was amazing really delicious and nice selection and good value Liked the layout of the bar and dining areas felt homely and staff were amazing Comfy bed and great location easy to jump onto Tram 5 
421970,citizenM Amsterdam, Tiny room means sleeping only Nowhere to open a suitcase except on the bed Felt more like a dorm room than a hotel, The lobby and common areas bar and food area were so interesting and inviting
421971,citizenM Amsterdam, Would not recommend for longer than 2 day business trip due to lack of closet space hangers for clothes , Good location Rethinking about why rooms are booked with excellent office area in central location rather poorly designed desks in room Canteen style food and eating area which is good for a lone traveler Excellent bed
421972,citizenM Amsterdam, The bathroom situation is a bit weird with the shower and toilet enclosed in two see through tubes in the room There is a curtain to pull across but that s also see through It did make me laugh though , Bed was huge and super comfy great bar downstairs and really helpful staff A very modern hotel that was good value for money Although not centrally located the public transport routes are excellent 
421973,citizenM Amsterdam, We couldn t open the window or switch off the air conditioning Expensive breakfast Hotel doesn t have a proper restaurant hence limited food options , Very modern lovely bar reception area helpful staff good location
421974,citizenM Amsterdam, Glass screen around the toilet would have been a bit uncomfortable in company , Staff were absolutely excellent The whole set up was very good room free films wifi that worked ALL THE TIME but it was the staff that really made it Polite conscientious proactively helpful I ve stayed in business class hotels all over the world and not seen anything quite like it Even the cleaner in the corridor stopped to talk to me First class
421975,citizenM Amsterdam, Breakfast dinner menu were too small Toilet flush has to be fixed after every use , Liked everything Facilities style environment location helpful staff 
421976,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Everything about this hotel was simply amazing Spotlessly clean the staff are something else couldn t have been anymore helpful polite very friendly 
421977,citizenM Amsterdam, The fact u can t open a window was disappointing as it got very stuffy and needed fresh air coming in to the room, The room was lovely bed comfy and the films tv was great the bar and cocktails lovely and the hotel was very good
421978,citizenM Amsterdam, Rooms were a bit small but only there for the weekend with my boyfriend so it didn t actually effect our time, very modern hotel and clean Staff very lovely and really helpful too would defo come back
421979,citizenM Amsterdam, I didn t like how far the hotel was from dam square it was really annoying I think it wasn t worth the money for the amount off time u spent In room as it was so far out Also we were never notifed about the no cash policy Rooms had to be paid by card , Room was lovely very small but comfortable 
421980,citizenM Amsterdam, The rooms are really small and there is no privacy regarding the shower toilet Not very romantic when you are travelling with your boyfriend , Easy parking tram number 5 to the center just in front of the hotel 
421981,citizenM Amsterdam, What you gain in convenience for the RAI you loose in local amenities Local restaurants and bar are sparse It is nestled in suburbia , This is a friendly funky hotel that is a 10 minute walk fro the RAI across the park Perfect if you are working there There a tram 100 yards away that goes to the city centre or it is 5 minutes away to the Metro 
421982,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing, All staff are very helpful and the breakfast is delicious Good bar and we love the movies entertainment selections in the rooms A great place to bring teenagers too
421983,citizenM Amsterdam, There is no food to eat in the evening I had to order pizza from outside , It s a extremely modern hotel with fully high technology facilities Highly recommend to young couple 
421984,citizenM Amsterdam, No room service nor proper restaurant nor tea making facilities No soccer channels , The room s ambience and comfort of the bed Self check in and check out arrangements Proximity to train station while in quiet neighbourhood WiFi excellent 
421985,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, fantastic atmosphere very relaxed and friendly staff really good location 5 from Amstrdam Zuid train station a bit outside the noisy city center
421986,citizenM Amsterdam, Yeah the pod style bathroom and shower is a little weird but you adjust to it A little far from centre but completely doable Being a little picky , Love the concept Small rooms big public area Encouraged you out of your room and down stairs where the staff are friendly and global citizens Had a great time talking to people And great spaces to relax eat read a book All the things you need as a traveller are free wifi computers printing movies All free And wifi fast enough to steam Netflix and encouraged to do so
421987,citizenM Amsterdam, One of the towels wasn t clean at all which made me wonder about the overall cleanliness Everything else was very good , The location was very convenient just a few meters to metro station or tram stop with direct connection to the centre and Schiphol airport The hotel is perfect for a short stay the room is a bit small but has an extra comfy bed and all the amenities Common areas have a wonderful design 24h bar and very friendly staff 
421988,citizenM Amsterdam, We had issues with housekeeping several times Rooms were clean however the housekeeping service was not what we would have expected , Extra big bed the design of the hotel bar lobby area 
421989,citizenM Amsterdam, some traces of dubious smoke in the corridors Some way out from Centra Amsterdam tram No 5 good also used a few taxis to get back Very good for Airport on way back Amsterdam Zud , All the staff brilliant very funky to meet my daughter in Amsterdam for 18th birthday Super rooms and facilities Australian Emma on the bar brilliant Richard
421990,citizenM Amsterdam, Let s say that the room is quite special the shower and the toilet are in the middle in the room and not in a separate bathroom however everything is very stylish interesting for a couple of days but I would not recommend it for long stays, good connection to thecity center tram 5 extremely friendly personnel good breakfast free choice of movies in the room comfortable bed fast wifi fast check in check out
421991,citizenM Amsterdam, A few more pillows may have been nice, The staff were wonderful it was my Fianc s birthday and they wrote him a card and pinned balloons to our door We chatted for hours with them at the bar too The room was exactly what you need it was very clean and a great novelty using an ipad to control everything Although the facilities were in tubes in the room you didn t feel conscious using them
421992,citizenM Amsterdam, A few issues with one of our rooms iPad not working phone didn t ring until replaced and bed draw not opening and closing Sorted after 3 visits but better if fixed from the off ,No Positive
421993,citizenM Amsterdam, The ipad stopped working in the middle of my stay and you cannot control the heat without it I was so cold and all I got was an apology note my friend staying in another room got another ipad right away Had great experience staying at this hotel before but this time I was disappointed and may not return , Funky hotel nice staff at the bar comfortable bed 
421994,citizenM Amsterdam, The room is rather small with not much place to keep my luggage opened , The bed is extra comfy I was terribly sick at the hotel I called the front office staff asking them to bring me some sandwich and hot tea and charge the bill to my room They brought it up within 5 mins and told me is on the house and asked me to get well soon 
421995,citizenM Amsterdam, Some of the electronics and lights are a bit gimmicky the air conditioning made a lot of noise and would not respond to temperature control room is a bit cramped , Very modern rooms lovely bed 
421996,citizenM Amsterdam, As we travelled by car the public parking options were limited and pricy but this is more of a general issue when travelling to Amsterdam by car , compact but very comfortable rooms good location although a just outside city center 30min walk to Vondelpark and this for a reasonable price
421997,citizenM Amsterdam, Street very loud could barely sleep Room extremly small with toilet and shower inside Felt not comfortable taking a shower or even going to Toilet at night Water dropping inside shower throughout the night that was a torture Quality Cost Ratio too low,No Positive
421998,citizenM Amsterdam, I would have liked instructions on how to use the shower the nozzle turns left to turn on the rainfall shower head but I turned it right initially and sprayed myself with the hand held shower head , The iPad controlling the lighting TV and temperature was an awesome feature 
421999,citizenM Amsterdam, The rooms are quite small but ideal for a short break I will be staying at this hotel again, Staff were very helpful and absolutely lovely they created a very welcoming and friendly atmosphere gave great advice on where to go hotel is very clean and in a great location and 15 mins away you have great restaurants bars and museums
422000,citizenM Amsterdam, No daylight available due to strong blinds that could not be opened fully, Great experience overall Very modern and out of the box approach to tiny spaces in hotels So refreshingly different 
422001,citizenM Amsterdam, It was absolutely wonderful At first I was not familiar with the different approach of checking in but a friendly staff member immediately gave me the proper instructions The same goes for the iPad instructions in the room Just loved it Breakfast was both eye pleasing and delicious , The diversity professionalism friendliness of the staff The ambiance design of the hotel 
422002,citizenM Amsterdam, The breakfast is a little bit expansive But the products seem to be hight quality even though they will not please everyone quirky , Check in at anytime even late evening Room concept very funny Good Wifi Access to computers books tv in the lobby 
422003,citizenM Amsterdam, It s far away from the city centre rooms are small, It s modern hotel There is really good wifi so rare for hotels You can control everything in the room by ipad 24 hours food and drinks available Good looking and modern hotel Breakfast was okay for the price 
422004,citizenM Amsterdam, I personally loved the hotel if I had to say something negative I would say it s about 20 mins on the tram from dam square but we knew that before we booked And also the windows don t open at all So room felt a little stuffy at times Overall perfect place , The staff at this hotel are AMAZING could not be nicer The hotel itself is gorgeous rooms are perfect for a city break The tram stop is just outside the hotel which brings you to all the main districts in Amsterdam the train for the airport is also only a 5 min walk 
422005,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, The night manager on arrival and Emma and Robby the next morning were exquisite in their service after they learned of my previous nightmare at CM a X fer at 2 00 AM from airport to Zuid facility in pouring rain because the night manager who was very rude had given away the last room without notifying me in advance My flight was 6 hrs later and so had to cut my sleep again to make the X fer back to schiphol 
422006,citizenM Amsterdam, location is a bit off city center but close to railway station south and tram room is a bit small , young and chic hitech comfy bed helpful staff 
422007,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Great location the best most friendly staff I ve encountered in Amsterdam so far The beds are extremely comfortable and I love the modern design of the hotel 
422008,citizenM Amsterdam, Despite the smart arrangement of the rooms they are relatively small So a bit of a lack of privacy in the toilet for instance , The room with king size bed and free movies 24 hour food and drinks were also a big plus Direct tram line within 15 min right in the centre of Amsterdam 
422009,citizenM Amsterdam, Limited hanging space but manageable with under the bed options , Fantastic capsule design The bed is brilliant but not a room for sharing if you are modest 
422010,citizenM Amsterdam, overall great experience, We had a great 3 night stay in the CitizenM The Hotel s design is very modern and targeted at a younger crowd Staff was super friendly and helpful with checking in Rooms are very special and modern The bed is really big and comfortable You can manage everything in the room from an iPad They have a great selection of movies which you can watch The toilet and shower are kind of in the middle of the room and maybe for 2 friends travelling together that could be a bit awkward in the beginning Tram is right next to the building so it is super easy to get to the city center in 15minutes 
422011,citizenM Amsterdam, 1 The hotel is not very close to the city center but we had a car so we didn t mind 2 The toilet is exposed except for a semi frosted glass that you close But still you have to be prepared and not shy , I had experienced an open room concept once before but traveling solo so this time I was a bit skeptical however based on the good reviews we went ahead Check in was piece of cake In the room everything is controlled by an ipad and that was an exciting surprise The bed is very comfortable and the room itself is thoroughly lighted bright Very nice concept Rooms are small but well organised Wifi is free and you have access to hundreds of movies for free during your stay 
422012,citizenM Amsterdam, Limited privacy in Bathroom area which is screened by a Curtain rather than separated from bedroom area, Ideal location one stop from Airport and 5 minute walk from Amsterdam Zuid train station Tram takes around 20 mins into Central Amsterdam Hotel clean comfortable and quiet staff receptive and welcoming Bar open 24 hours reasonable selection of snack foods also offers some hot food Free movies and number of Uk tv stations Room open plan so if you prefer privacy when washing etc maybe this Hotel not for you
422013,citizenM Amsterdam, There were extreme smells which came through the shower now and again and on arrival the room didnt smell too good , I loved how modern the hotel was We had alot of privacy and the location was amazing being only 3 mins from Zuid station and across the road from a tram stop which took you into the centre 
422014,citizenM Amsterdam, the room is either to cold or to hot you cant get a happy medium it took ages to heat up also Price for water crisps etc advise to get them from local super markets 4 euros for water O If someone smokes in there room the full floors fire alarm goes off in each room not good very loud especially at 4 in morning grrrrr Also had to pay 20 30 euros for a taxi home each nite from dam square so we spent a small fortune on taxis as the trams stop before 12, the hotel Is very funky and cool the staff were really nice and made lovely cocktails
422015,citizenM Amsterdam, when trawling the internet for a hotel near Schiphol airport Citizen M came up on booking com so booked it but when we arrived oh dear to our horror it was the wrong one yes they have another in Amsterdam after 13hrs flying all you want is your bed the young man on duty helped by storing our cases we then had to get a train find the other one one hr later we arrived so this is a warning to others they have 2 citizen hotels would recommend to friends , very functional and modern loved the layout of the room plus the ipad for the navigating of the lights and TV
422016,citizenM Amsterdam, Only thing I didn t like was the location a bit fare out but would be perfect for anyone just looking to relax away from the hussle and bussle of general life not for anyone looking to experience Amsterdam for wot it s famous for , The staff were exceptional couldn t do enough to help Hotel it self was lovely room was very nice Food was lovely over all had a pleasant stay 
422017,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing really , Easy access to local transport Very modern rooms and hotel We had some confusion over our check in which took a little longer than we anticipated to no fault of anyone s For this they compensated us with drinks on the house after we had settled in which started our night and holiday perfectly Nice futuristic rooms hotel and definitely worth your money Also included a microwave free of use if you had a night like us where you could warm up last nights take away Friendly staff Very cosy hotel Perfect
422018,citizenM Amsterdam, That we only stayed for one night , Staff was amazing location was perfect just outside of the centre tram round the corner Good was delicious especially the pumpkin soup cleanliness and service of a very high standard Cannot imagine staying anywhere else on our next trip to Amsterdam 
422019,citizenM Amsterdam, Will never get over the bathroom area the fact that the other person can see your silhouette some things should always stay private , Loved that everything is controlled by the ipad lights blinds tv Very cool Shower is also amazing with rainfall and handheld options 
422020,citizenM Amsterdam, Not really a bad thing we just couldn t get the thermostat on the shower to a good temperature initially it took some playing around , The design of the room was unique and thoughtful we really liked the shower and toilet modules the compact storage facilities and of course the mood and light switch functionalities The bartender was excellent and the drinks were great The hotel is in an excellent location with fantastic train tram connections to the centre and the airport 
422021,citizenM Amsterdam, The location was ok it is a team ride into town the windows seemed thin and I could hear every conversation of the smokers out side the front door , The common area was great The bar the seating areas the computers were all great 
422022,citizenM Amsterdam, Privacy of the bathroom definitely not a deal breaker though , Great hospitality All of the employees were extremely helpful and gave us great recommendations of what to do in the city Great facility I loved the modern concept The rooms were awesome I loved being able to control everything with the iPad
422023,citizenM Amsterdam, The 24hour food was just small snacks eg crisps which were too expensive , The room was nice a bit on the small side but clean and comfortable 
422024,citizenM Amsterdam, The lavatory situation in the bedroom offers no privacy at all , The whole ethos of this hotel is excellent It is modern comfortable and clean with food and drink available 24 hours a day
422025,citizenM Amsterdam, The arrangement of the room without a completely separate bathroom is very stylish but not ideal It wasn t a problem for us but one might need to think about who is sharing the room with before booking Very minor thing one day when cleaning the room they didn t put back the shower mat but all good the next day , Interesting modern and technological design nice and clean rooms Good location close to public transports Very helpful and nice staff 
422026,citizenM Amsterdam, It is not located in a central spot if you want to stay in the touristic circle of Amsterdam However it is just 2 min walk from Zuid Metro Station and the tram number 5 stop just opposite to the hotel takes approx 20 min to the central Station , The hotel is cool and stylish with a modern touch 
422027,citizenM Amsterdam, like other hotels the window in the rooms cannot be opened which is very annoying for me Did not like the collage photopicture in front of the elevators where some scenes are frankly sad and distasteful , staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful the free wifi free luggage storage and general coziness of the hotel the lobby area is very welcoming and the bar is open 24 hours 
422028,citizenM Amsterdam, Hidden fees upon arrival Staff were rude and unfriendly when questioning said fees Distance from city centre was quite uncomfortable especially since it was winter No food service unless breakfast was booked prior Almost like a hostel but private Not a great deal of privacy when using the bathroom or showering if sharing a room had thought the frosted glass would have been a little more frosty Couldn t get the movies to work either , The wifi was great and the room was quite groovy The colourful lights made mood setting lots of fun No noise heard from surrounding rooms so sleep ins were perfect Free drink upon arrival was a nice touch and following drinks in the lobby bar were reasonably priced 
422029,citizenM Amsterdam, Needed a bit more privacy with the toilet Also wanted more space to open suitcases Sorely also missed having a small fridge to store purchased dutch cheeses during stay no need for a mini bar though , Free movies wifi tablet controller interior design cleanliness staff helpfulness high tech check in and check out process location to tram five station and therefore ease of travel in to town 
422030,citizenM Amsterdam, Bedroom layout which was smaller than expected had to climb over partner to get in out of bed as it took up entire available space no gap to the left or to the end of bed Glazed toilet pod would have preference for more conventional separate room rather than loo being in the bedroom , Extremely comfortable bed iPad for room TV temperature blinds etc etc
422031,citizenM Amsterdam, Obviously toilet n bath no cupboard no slippers no dustbin We were like literally surrounded by our luggages cloths hanging all over the place n rubbish stuck in the so call dressing stainless steel stand All u can do in hotel is jump into the bed once u r in the room This hotel is only suitable for those lovers whom have just met n with handy luggage , The lobby atmosphere was good speedy self service check in out were great too must book breakfast in advance good value The best thing about this hotel is there is a Crazy Monkey Hot Yoga nearby a fantastic place for yoga lover and there is a very good restaurant nearby I think it s called the Gouchon The grilled steak spare ribs are delicious

422037,citizenM Amsterdam, The pluming is horrible You can hear everything and it sort of drips all night It needs sorting out Also there is very little privacy Just a curtain between bed and shower and a glass from the toilet Definitely not somewhere you want to stay with someone you are not comfortable with The pluming is a nightmare It drops all night and everytime room has a shower you can hear the water running over your head Not very nice and it needs sorting out , The bed is amazing The best bed I have ever slept on The Windows are awesome and the fact everything is operated via your own iPad is brilliant The staff is super helpful and the early check in late check out is brilliant Only a 20m tram ride and on a quote location perfect if you don t want to stay in the middle of all the action The 24h bar is also a great addition

422040,citizenM Amsterdam, Bathroom and toilet are in the room located in two giant glass test tubes Have a look on line and you will see takes a little getting used to so maybe not ideal for your first ever romantic break as a couple No fridge but the 24hr bar will give you ice as well as sell you beverages , Great staff who care about hospitality Biggest bed ever Cool climate lighting media controls Very clean Located a little out of centre in the WTC Rai area but buy a travelcard and get the number 5 tram to the action Quick easy access by train tram or taxi to airport Good value Nice lounge and bar area Will stay again for sure The late checkout until 4pm option was perfect and a sensible price 
422041,citizenM Amsterdam, We stayed in room 425 and when we arrived there was a dirty tissue behind the mattress and what appeared to be dried mucus on the wall behind the bed We wasn t sure what it was But the next morning me and my partner woke up very sick and under the weather I m not sure if it was the people staying in the room before us that was ill but it could of been avoided if the bedsheets were changed maybe We didn t want to raise concern because we are a very shy couple and we can t really deal with confrontation , Lobby staff were always happy to ask if we wanted needed anything

422044,citizenM Amsterdam, While having bath toilet right in the middle of your room is somewhat refreshing it is not practical It is worth staying there one night just for the cool stuff iPad controlled room self check in but my room won t do me no good for a week stay There is no proper wardrobe after all , Big bed light and sound settings fit to your mood excellent staff good quality of the breakfast free on demand movies

422059,citizenM Amsterdam, It can get a bit too cramped in the room even with just 2 pieces of luggage More hangers would be useful especially when it s the cold season and we have many more layers on , Very helpful and friendly staff on hand at any point in time The room was fantastic and modern free movies comfortable king sized bed glass capsule shower Though the hotel is half an hour from the city centre by tram the stop is just a couple of minutes walk away It s also just 1 train stop away from the airport followed by 5 mins walk from the train station 
422060,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing except the location was a bit far than expected from the city center but a tram station was just opposite of the hotel with 10 15 mins ride Although tram access are only till half past midnight so if you plan to stay longer late nights in the city center then be ready to spend using cab or Uber which is an easy 10 15 euros per way , over all concept of the hotel was just a breathe of fresh air like mostly everything good for solo travelers and couples but not for the family as the room s are built for not for more than 2 persons Bed is too comfy there is just one day that i over slept and lost the day already cause the entire mattress will suck you in for a good reason Variety of breakfast was decent internet was fast Advanced TV and room access via an ipad a first i m well traveled and stayed in so many 4 5 star hotels but this one just puts it on the top Fyi self service check in hotel

422116,citizenM Amsterdam, Bed slightly too hard minor thing room a bit squashed for two people and slight lack of privacy Hanging space for clothes needs to be rethought and mini fridge would be ideal , The excellent self check in and out modern feel of the hotel in general iPad control in room with the free movies is a great touch Great transport links Amsterdam Zuid station 3 mins walk and tram 5 to centre of city right outside hotel 
422117,citizenM Amsterdam, Room is very small Toilet is right in the room with poor noise insulation That can be a problem for some couples We stayed only one night so that was ok but I would prefer to stay in bigger room for longer period , Interesting hotel designed for young people to stay Location is ok staff was very friendly nice breakfast 
422118,citizenM Amsterdam, Room is very small and bed is huge which occupies most of the room The design of the room with toilet and shower right in the middle is okay for a solo person but will be uncomfortable for 2 people, Bed was very comfortable Location is good very near to Zuid station The ipad for controlling settings is cool Free movies

422124,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, I have to say while the CitizenM chain is a bit different I like them The rooms are designed to maximize space While they are small they are very efficient and comfortable Very large bed They have a very inviting common area on the floor level They also have free bikes to use to explore Amsterdam with While the hotel isn t the most convenient for city center it is convenient to the Zuid train station and right on the Tram 5 line which takes you right to city center and past the museum area So it is easy to get a day pass from the airport take a short ride on the train to the Zuid station and hotel Then hop a tram to pretty much anywhere else in the city you wish to go 
422125,citizenM Amsterdam, Probably just my age but concept of layout felt really strange for me and you would need to have a really close relationship if you were sharing with someone as the toilet set up was very different, Really quick to check in and out really easy to get to and from with public transport Close to airport great TV system and control system wifi worked great
422126,citizenM Amsterdam, There is no wardrobe in the room Rooms are quite small Closet and shower in the middle of the room Can not imagine share this room with someone If you are looking for standard bussines accomodation look elsewhere , People staff just amazing Nice bar perfect living room downstairs TV Films WiFi free Comfy bed Perfect service Possibility of renting bike for free Perfect hotel for technofile whole room is controlled through ipad

422129,citizenM Amsterdam, Breakfast is just dull not bad but very poor choice every day the same , Clean ultramodern hotel Very nice modern comfortable and cosy common rooms good wi fi mac computers in the lounge absolutely excellent staff free atmosphere It s worth to visit and explore Yes and try cocktails they are unforgettable especially expresso martini and violet martini with lavender 
422130,citizenM Amsterdam, A little off from the main centre no room service room was a little expensive , The bed was really comfortable reasonably priced bar bus and tram station just outside very near to metro station 30 mins walk to city center 
422131,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Loved the IPad to operate just about everything in the room great novelty item which kept myself especially rather entertained Location is good approximately 15 minute tram which run every 10 minutes till about midnight Definitely staying here on our next visit 
422132,citizenM Amsterdam, If you have phobia privacy issues concerning bathing and bathroom usage or feel that you could be claustrophobic this hotel may not be for you , Quirky modern boutique hotel Wonderful helpful staff Great bed and pillows Enjoyed the common areas Coffee and service is excellent 
422133,citizenM Amsterdam, The room was small and the service standard is inconsistent The front desk staff Sylvia was particularly rude to us when we couldn t get the shower to work On the other hand her colleague Robbie was very helpful when we asked for directions etc The hotel concept is cool but overpriced considering the lack of service , The bed was really comfortable 
422134,citizenM Amsterdam, breakfast basics no coffee 20 30 people in the morning asking for the basics at the bar with only two employees working using an espresso machine people are trying to get going to get out into the city at 0800 and you are waiting for a glass of water or just a quick cup of coffee for 30 mins or more due to line of people wanting breakfast , room bed tv wifi and free movies room is great 
422135,citizenM Amsterdam, Would have preferred slightly more choice at breakfast, Really close to the tram and rail station so getting into the city centre was easy All the staff were really helpful The room was always clean and I loved all the high tech stuff 
422136,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, It was the coolest stay experience I had in a long time It was a new concept all together and it worked well from the check in out food and room layout All the staff were obviously well trained it was as if they new they are on to something new and they always seemed to be exited about working there Well done I stayed directly afterwards in a traditional business Hotel and it was absolutely boring 
422137,citizenM Amsterdam, Location is not so good nowhere interesting is in walking distance so a lot of trams and taxi time needed , Brilliant staff friendly helpful sociable Great bar and living areas 
422138,citizenM Amsterdam, The fact that they didn t take cash for a room payment I was unaware of this , The room was very modern with a decent sized bed the staff were very friendly too
422139,citizenM Amsterdam, Minimal room freebies such as slippers a comb other toiletries No soap dish on the small washbasin to ensure soap did not slip to the floor Not enough clothes hanging facilities No toilet brush , Self check in check out Staff is friendly without being overly so agile serviced reception bar etc and professional High standard shower toilet fixtures 
422140,citizenM Amsterdam, I did not expect the room to be in such a layout Privacy was severely lacking as the modern layout consisting of an open bathroom with a separate tube for the shower and tube for the toilet were completely see through with only a sheer current providing a false sense of privacy Made for an interesting experience sharing a suite with a non spouse Also was woken up early morning to one of the most aggressive alarms I have ever heard to find out that it was set off due to the iPad which controls all elements of the room running out of battery , Extremely friendly staff Clever hotel design and branding with quirky and meaningful touches including travel quotes around the hotel Very comfortable bed and loved the free movie options in the rooms Enjoyed staying out of the downtown core of Amsterdam as it was an easy tram or walk into the city and was conveniently a 5 minute walk from the Amsterdam South train station Great buffet meals however would have liked a more affordable option for the times I wanted a smaller portion or a select part of the spread 
422141,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Fifthtime Ihave stayed here still fab Quirky very comfy great staff effecient out of town so a bit quieter but a ten minute tram ride from right outside to the centre Love this place and the new in room I pads are great 
422142,citizenM Amsterdam, In room tea making facilities would have been a great bonus , Excellent location surprisingly close to tranquil Beatrix Park Loved the variety of breakfast buffet and comfy bed 
422143,citizenM Amsterdam, Quite small room and the windows do not open The i pad sometimes gets stuck when you try to adjust the tv volume The actual toilet and shower are in the room no delimitation whatsoever except for some glass doors that are rather transparent You can hear and even see your roommate partner when he goes to the bathroom which can bother you at times Breakfast was quite basic and it was the same every day mainly scrambled eggs with bacon and tomatoes some salmon cheese gem cereals and strawberries , Very interesting room everything is automatic and controlled by an i pad you have mood lights you have free access to a variety of films Very comfortable bed and pillows Soundproof room ideal for light sleepers The personnel was great very nice and helpful The quickest check in and check out Very close to the tram station across the street and very close to the train bus station ideal if you also want to visit places outside of Amsterdam the train takes 7 minute from to Schiphol airport 
422144,citizenM Amsterdam, unique design of rooms lack privacy toilette in the middle of the room but still kind of cool , extremely good mood of staff innovative design of rooms cool and comfy common areas to chill out
422145,citizenM Amsterdam, We are stay there for two nights but the staff didn t giving us the next day soap which we sometimes need to wash Hands or towels , The bed was really comfortable and the television and lights were all controlled by iPad which is really convenient for us There has a lot of good movie my little sister was really like it Haha 
422146,citizenM Amsterdam, Nothing to dislike Perhaps breakfast could be included with the stay , This hotel is only 6 minutes away by train from Schiphol Airport We would recommend it for either a couple or solo traveller as there is not much privacy with the shower and toilet being in the room and not separate The bed is very comfortable and the wi fi excellent 
422147,citizenM Amsterdam, the design in the rooms is supposed to be hip but I actually found it rather appalling You will like it if you enjoy using the toilet behind semi opaque sliding doors and taking a shower in a completely transparent space Perhaps good for a night of passion certainly not good for families , the low price
422148,citizenM Amsterdam, Hotel is a little far from the centre 25 minute tram journey from Centraal station However the tram stop is right outside the hotel and there is also a train station close by , Great facilities and in room technology liked that everything could be controlled from the iPad Clean and comfortable rooms comfy bed Hotel was very modern and well designed 
422149,citizenM Amsterdam, Aircon can t be turned off temperature can be set and found it created a draft in the room , Extremely friendly and helpful staff Super modern and unique decor and theme 
422150,citizenM Amsterdam, I saw the food and wasn t impressed I didn t have this included in my room price but there was a distinct lack of options , The Ipad in the room was a great touch of modern life the staff were really helpful and the free wifi was super fast Located in the south of Amsterdam the area was lovely with lots of things to do and great transport links 
422151,citizenM Amsterdam, I did not not like anything , Breakfast is simple but really good food Its nice that they have quality instead of quantity I mean that the food choice is not a lot but what they offer is amazing The staff was great as usual making you feel at home I am originally from Amsterdam so know what is a good location or not Its quiet close to the tram train and subway Tram 5 takes you straight to Leidsche Square in 10 min 
422152,citizenM Amsterdam, In the rooms not coffee and tea and refrigerator It is very big problem in summer becouse you can not save cold water or other drinks for you , Personal Wi fi
422153,citizenM Amsterdam, No coffe and tea and refrigerator in room It is very big problem in summer becouse you can not save cold water or other drink for you , Personal Wi fi
422154,citizenM Amsterdam, One of the staff was chit chatting for 5 minutes with one of the guest something like travelling experience in Australia when I was waiting to ask him some questions He kinds of completely ignore my existence I know it is good to maintain good relationship with guests but it should be with limit at least if other guest need help and waiting for him and he should back to his work and help me with thing related to the hotel instead of talking his travel experience in Australia, it s clean and modern the design is good too
422155,citizenM Amsterdam, Very tiny rooms almost like a capsule It s fine for a few days Interesting experience , Nice design Trendy Good location 5 min walk to Zuid station Great lobby Well priced breakfast 
422156,citizenM Amsterdam,No Negative, Location fab from other reviews was worried would be too far out but just 10 mins on Tram outside hotel or 25 mins walking to town 5 mins walk from train station Beds so comfy room feels relaxing with shut out blinds mood lighting and movies on demand Staff helpful and very friendly Very modern hotel

422159,citizenM Amsterdam, It is in the CBD and a little way away from a few of the attractions but it gives you a chance to see a lot along the way , The staff were excellent and happy to answer any questions we had The hotel has a great modern theme with giant comfy beds which is great after a day of sightseeing 
422160,citizenM Amsterdam, The windows cannot be opened which is absurd as the environment is so quiet and green The room architecture includes a WC without any possibility of washing oneself One has to take a shower every time one needs to go as the shower does not function unless the doors of the cabin are closed The architect should have learned a little and consider the ergonomic science , The location is excellent close to the train as well as public transportation The neighborhood is quiet and green near a beautiful park Very interesting inside architecture 
422161,citizenM Amsterdam, Small rooms with beam me up Scottie type shower and toilet soaps changed once in 5 days hotel running out of salmon for breakfasts yet charging 23 euros for a couple all supposed to be more reasonable price wise since all the services are almost self services but the price and the location are not reasonable Not recommended for 30 people,No Positive
422162,citizenM Amsterdam, I was unsure about the general area that Citizen M was in but saying that the transport is so good in Amsterdam that you can get on a tram outside and be in amongst cafe s and bars in a short time , I always like the relaxed atmosphere that Citizen M provides and loved the free wifi and up to date films 
422163,citizenM Amsterdam, Room was not serviced by housekeeping in a timely manner , The large beds overall room design and friendly helpful staff Also for techies like me the personalized welcome via iPad and flat screen was awesome Controlling shades lighting and moods also in one place was also great
