470936,Art Hotel Navigli, I had a room on 3rd floor just below the breakfast restaurant The noice was so loud from chairs moving around and people walking and talking that it was impossible to sleep once the breakfast was open Furthermore we were not informed that the aircondition didnt work in our room So i had to call the reception 03 00 am in the night at which point the room was very hot After calling the reception 3 times some one finally picked up and just turned on the air condition and then hung However we still couldn t adjust the temperature meaning that we both got a cold It seemed to me that you knew that the aircon was turned off and didn t work but didn t bother to tell us Last but not least i was locked in the bathroom for 45 minutes just before leaving the hotel and going to the airport The effort from the personel to get me out wasnt exactly very impressive Had to kick the door open after the 45 minutes in order to catch my flight That resulted in a injured foot for the following days The keys were removed from the other bathroom stalls including the girls which go me thinking that this had been a problem before All this would have been okay if I was simply informed and at least compensated in some way But there was only a sorry , The location is great and the spa sauna and gym facilities were nice 
470937,Art Hotel Navigli, The view from the room I guess but really is splitting hairs We were out exploring , Big comfy bed really nice staff great location excellent breakfast buffet 
470938,Art Hotel Navigli, Shower access, Location was excellent for both local restaurants and bars and access to the Metro into the city centre Free parking in the underground garage 
470939,Art Hotel Navigli, Nothing , Rooms were extremely clean and beds very comfortable Breakfast was amazing very full buffet with something for everyone Lobby bar had fantastic happy hour with lots of delicious snacks Staff was courteous and friendly and did all they could do to make our stay enjoyable Highly recommend and would definitely stay here again 
470940,Art Hotel Navigli, Unfortunately it was very noisy from 7AM as the cleaning personal was talking in front of our room and then they started renovation a room next to our Sleeping after 9AM was impossible, Breakfast was good and it has a big variety
470941,Art Hotel Navigli, Room quite hot and you can t control own room temperature have to ask reception to turn it down which they did , Great location only a few minutes from the metro and right in the heart of the Navigli district with plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from great breakfast very comfortable beds 
470942,Art Hotel Navigli, I requested a no smoking bedroom but told there were none as all the bedrooms were available for smokers to use I refused the first room allocated as it smelled of stale smoke The second was better although when the room got hot it was noticeable If your a non smoker it is off putting Air condition was not controllable in the room hence the room temperature was 25 much too hot for the weather conditions outside 30 and unable to leave a window open because of the mosquitos I was very disappointed that was not addressed during the five days we were there and the handy man leaving a sugar sachet in the card slot to keep the air con working was not a fix of a problem It did nothing to reduce the temperature making sleeping uncomfortable and from what we saw at reception it actually appeared to be controlled centrally rather than by guests in their room , The welcome drink was a very nice touch The breakfast room bright and airy Great breakfast choice rooms and hotel in general very clean and comfortable Reception on arrival efficient and welcoming Efficient and pleasant rather than friendly I would say 
470943,Art Hotel Navigli, Nothing, The suite was spacious for a family of four Comfortable beds good air conditioning The best part was the impeccable service that we received there Very helpful staff Lovely breakfast huge selection Just around the corner is a canal with many restaurants and cafes and there is a supermarket directly opposite The duomo is within walking distance and it is a very pretty walk Good selection of teas and pod machine in room 
470944,Art Hotel Navigli, the welcome drink can just be drunk between 18 30 and 22 00 even though the bar is open till 00 00 the hotel is not in the city centre and on sundays or late at night e g the tramway just passes every 15 min the surrounding area is very crowded on friday saturday evenings but do not worry you won t hear anything inside of the hotel , nice wellness free access in the 6th floor with free tea an water super location directly at the navigli with access to restaurants and bars with tram line 2 in 15 minutes to the dome and with the metro in 15 20 min to the central station very friendly staff always wanted to help you and do not just want your money vegan and gluten free snacks at breakfast buffet choice of snacks tea and juices at the bar free of charge
470945,Art Hotel Navigli,No Negative, For a night we spent to this hotel our experience was excellent The room was clean big The hotel was very closed to a supermarket located just on the other side of the hotel street and very closed to a restaurant area Parking very easy and located on the hotel underground Breakfast with a large variety of foods 
470946,Art Hotel Navigli, 15 Euro night charge for having a dog in the room Wasn t a problem to pay the extra fee but usually other hotels in Italy offer a water bowl treats even a dog bed if they charge for pets Could be nice to offer something for the furry guests too Also be sure to bring insect spray with you if you decide to stay in Navigli Mosquitoes swarm the canal area at night , Great selection at breakfast Loved having a coffee tea station in the room The hotel was quiet especially considering the location next to bars and restaurants 
470947,Art Hotel Navigli, The picture of the Duomo which used to be the main picture on Booking com was misleading about the location Now there is a much more informative picture but the Duomo is still improperly presented among the pictures the pictures of the canal are very beautiful and properly exhibit the location s charm The reception team was very friendly but not always well informed , The location near the lively and exciting Navigli area was excellent and the hotel was still in a very quiet place The rooms were very convenient and nicely decorated The art works in all public areas contributed greatly to the cosiness and atmosphere Breakfast was simple but excellent and the welcome happy hour buffet was also great 
470948,Art Hotel Navigli, Unable to purchase snacks and beverages after bar is closed Had difficulty finding entrance on arrival with car , Very helpful reception staff Spacious clean accommodation Good breakfast Easy access to public transport 
470949,Art Hotel Navigli, Was it worth it I think generally Milan hotels are way over priced Also they wanted to charge me a full days car parking when I asked if I could park a car for 30mins in carpark , Imagine yourself walking into your artist friends house where the walls are painted rough and random arr hung on the wall but the place also feels homely and nice That s what I felt here I was expecting something older but my room was clean and felt unused Also I ve never seen a breakfast setup like theres before Anything and everything you could want for breakfast 
470950,Art Hotel Navigli, AC was not strong when we were there it hit over 90F 33 C and the AC could not cool the room The temp in the room did not go below 24 25 C 78F We asked and they were very nice to change rooms but that did not help much They have an old central AC system that could not keep up When we first checked in they gave us a room that had a strong smoking smell and they agreed to change it right away The TV system is not very reliable some channels show and some don t , Very nice area next to lots of things to do artsy area with restaurants cafes and some shops Close to Tram subway to go all over Milan Breakfast buffet was great and offers much to choose from eggs sandwiches bacon ham fresh juices you can make your own breads muffins you name it The coffee biscuits bar in the afternoon is nice and the happy hour snacks are great and go from 6 10 PM Rooms are decent Hotel personnel are very very friendly and helpful 
470951,Art Hotel Navigli,No Negative, The hotel is in a side alley off of the canal easy to reach from the Metro Porta Genova It doesn t look up to much from the outside but much better inside The staff were very friendly and helpful Beds very comfortable we had a room with a sofa too plus a small balcony which overlooked a quiet square filled with trees and singing birds in the evenings The free drink voucher was great as was the aperitivo buffet free too although the lobby area where it is served lacks ambience Disappointed with the roof terrace not shown in photos and not worth a visit What appears to be the roof terrace in the photos with parasols etc is out the back of the hotel lobby Very clean bathroom very good with some nice toiletries Robe and slippers provided Lively area with lots of bars and restaurants very busy on a Saturday night Recommend the Mag Caf for cocktails and El Brellin for dinner and any other bar to sit with a glass of Aperol Would recommend this hotel and the whole area 
470952,Art Hotel Navigli, Shame it didn t have a pool however lovely quiet roof top terrace to have a glass of wine at the end of the night and star gaze , Awesome location along the Navagli Canal wander along the pedestrian walkway by the canal to visit a multitude of bars and restaurants Fantastic spot to savour Milan nightlife A pleasant walk into the Duomo takes about 20 30 minutes depending on your speed and the heat Lots of interesting small boutiques to browse in as you walk along more interesting than the standard chain stores in the centre Beautiful breakfast room and selection of food Would stay again 
470953,Art Hotel Navigli,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and accommodating The rooms were very clean and spacious We stayed in superior double room This is the second time I have stayed and the first time for my husband and it didn t disappoint Loved it
470954,Art Hotel Navigli, The shower fell off the wall on top of me We reported it to front desk who got the maintenance man to fix it whilst we were out The outside of the hotel is shabby as others have remarked We asked for early check in but only got in at a quarter to 2 so had to go and rest on park benches and cafes for a few hours after an all night flight Next time I will choose hotel that will guarantee me an early checkin , The location is charming breakfast was fine the cleaning staff very efficient the interiors are interesting and art fun We were given our free drink prosecco on the first night 
470955,Art Hotel Navigli, Price a bit too high for the hotel level, The location is excellent in the middle of the Navigli with a lot of action and life day and night However the hotel is quiet staff very kind and breakfast excellent and abundant
470956,Art Hotel Navigli, Older male receptionist Very gruff Room temp hard to adjust , Location in trendy arty area 10eu taxi ride from train station Modern hotel with fabulous artwork around Happy hour and welcoming bar and outside area Light airy Many restaurants to choose from in area Nice helpful English speaking receptionist 
470957,Art Hotel Navigli, Closing the room doors is very loud because the doors have outside a doorknob so many guests pop the doors when they leave the room The Wifi is bad for this reason the hotel is not recommendable My sleep pants disapeared because the room service put it together with the bedsheets when they cleaned the room The hotel management gave me no compensation for this inconvenience This is an absolutely do not for a service company , The hotel is located in a nice area The breakfast is very good an rich 
470958,Art Hotel Navigli, Nothing, The bed was wonderful great nights sleep The staff were superb went out of their way to be helpful Nothing was too much for any of the staff
470959,Art Hotel Navigli, I paid through booking com with the company s credit card which of course I didn t have with me at the time of my staying Although the payment was authorised by the managing director by email sent directly to their back office they didn t want to process the payment with that card so I had to provide them with my personal credit card which is something I never do when I stay at hotel on business trips as usually everything is paid upfront ,No Positive

470976,Art Hotel Navigli, The employee that did our check in was rude he didn t seemed welcoming at all and didn t replied our questions which is a shame seeing the rest of the team all of them pretty helpful and lovely On top of that he never offered us the welcome drink we were supposed to have according to the booking reservation We missed some clean towels the second day although we did leave the dirty ones on the floor The smell of humidity and the lack of ventilation were a bit too present It would be lovely to have more light warmer as well , Breakfast was fabulous and varied and served in a nice space The bedroom was spacious clean and quite The spa and common spaces were good as well as having free iced tea water and some coffee for the costumers close to the reception at the bar The location is exceptional in front of a very popular cocktail place and right in the Navigli the best area in Milano to hang out

470978,Art Hotel Navigli, There was nothing about the service or comfort that I could criticise The only thing I would say as a recommendation to the hotel would be to refurbish the outside artwork the lights on the garden wall They are really cool but need to be revived The inside of the hotel is spotlessly clean and in great condition so they are just lacking that last bit of attention to detail by looking after the outside , We loved the sauna and steam room and the fact that we had a bath in a room What we needed to unwind 
470979,Art Hotel Navigli, We loved everything about this hotel , The spa and sauna room were a welcome addition to the overall comfort of the hotel We loved the free welcome snacks and cocktail These were much appreciated after a long day of travelling

470989,Art Hotel Navigli, There is apparently no such thing as a non smoking room or floor in this hotel They seem to allow smoking on all floors It would make more sense to reserve a couple of floors for non smokers so they don t need to be disturbed by the habits of others , Comfortable bed and a nice sized room I really appreciated the kettle and coffee machine in the room The breakfast choice was quite extensive compared to other Italian hotels The location is great a few steps from the canal and a short walk to the metro

471028,Art Hotel Navigli, Very disturbing on arrival Staff not friendly on part due to the extreme noise they suffer because of works in progress bad conditions for them to receive hosts convenably Impossibility for hosts to use the hall of the hotel and lobby because of works and extreme noise Hotel should have closed or hosts previously informed , Comfortable and well equipped rooms
471029,Art Hotel Navigli, Somehow the double bed was put together from two twin beds , Great location it is by the canal with all the little restaurants and bars The area got some good vibes The staffs were nice and helpful Metro station is 5 mins away 
471030,Art Hotel Navigli, Undergoing renovations currently so was noisy during the day , Spacious room friendly helpful staff delicious breakfast and welcome drink in the bar courtyard very pleasant Best of all were the helpful instructions to find the hotel We travelled by train from Malpensa which took about an hour and was seamless we don t speak any Italian Supermarket opposite hotel Great area for restaurants and about a half hour walk to Duomo 
471031,Art Hotel Navigli, pillows were stone hard really hard but we got them swapped and it was much better furniture in the room a bit incongruous in style with the look of the hotel but perhaps that will change in the refurbishment, great location very helpful staff lovely breakfast
471032,Art Hotel Navigli,No Negative, Great breakfast very clean rooms excellent staff It s a bit difficult to find due to being in a pedestrian zone but once you know it s very easy The hotel is a bit dated compared to newer design hotels however it delivers more in terms of charm Beds are very good compared to those same newer design hotels like nhow Staff is very friendly they even have a bell boy man that brings your luggage to the room which is a nice touch The staff is also very professional calling up to the room if they can clean the room in the afternoon if you put up the do not disturb sign most hotels would just skip room cleaning until the next day Location is excellent right in the middle of the Navigli area it s right around the corner so at night you ll be right in the middle of great bars and restaurants A 
471033,Art Hotel Navigli, The walk to Piazza Del Duomo was longer than I expected , Great staff at the reception Rooms decore and space were excellent Location was next to a small river with good choices of restaurants and bars on both sides of the river Breakfast was adequate with variety of choices to please almost all tastes 
471034,Art Hotel Navigli, Construction was going on right at reception when we arrived so it was a bit off putting hotel should have sent an email sms ahead to inform us Walking to Duomo is too far in the heat of summer so had to take tram and metro instead, Located in vibey town outside from Duomo

471036,Art Hotel Navigli, Hotel was very hard to find at first as it is tucked away in a no driving zone and the directions provided were confusing We had to park a distance away and walk to find the hotel and then have them explain to us exactly how to drive there , Nice hotel interesting area close to lots of good restaurants and shops Breakfast buffet was good and the complimentary snacks and drink in the early evening was a nice touch Secure underground parking is a bonus and the hotel is fairly close to good transportation to downtown and other popular areas to visit

471046,Art Hotel Navigli, Overall the hotel is very tired and quite pricey for the shape it is in Although that is an issue with many hotels in Milan The rooms were just bearable although the little balcony terrace was quite nice and the bathroom was in excellent shape again not usual for destinations like Italy , Without exception the staff was really nice Breakfast was very nice as well from a European American perspective Also the location is really fantastic if you ve done the city center and want to experience local evening life and the local crowds that come with that Unique location that not too many tourists seem to have discovered

471056,Art Hotel Navigli, The place looks a bit run down from the front but the interior was nice The bar lounge area is nothing to speak of but then again why be at the hotel bar when there are so many great places nearby , Great area of Milan to be in The staff was friendly and the room with balcony was decent sized at a good price

471061,Art Hotel Navigli, We couldn t control the temperature of our room ourselves Had to perpetually leave the window open so that the room stays cool The hallways were kept super warm for reasons unknown to us , The hotel staff was very courteous Helped us with getting cabs at odd times of the day The hotel is located right opposite a department store Complimentary breakfast was really nice looked forward to it everyday Bathroom was good 
471062,Art Hotel Navigli, The bed was like sleeping on a stone It was supposed to be a double bed but was two single beds pushed together I woke up every morning feeling poorly from a rock hard mattress ,No Positive
471063,Art Hotel Navigli, Price is expensive We suggest that they remove the room number from keys which are a security risk if they get lost , The staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfasts were superb The welcome drink was very acceptable also 
471064,Art Hotel Navigli,No Negative, We loved the breakfast We were offered a drink on arrival and some snacks which were a very pleasant surprise An overall wondefrul stay at Art Navigli 
471065,Art Hotel Navigli, If your looking for a bathrobe you will have to call the reception the shower curtains are yellow at the bottom you can hear noises from the corridor , The location was great close to the center a bunch of great restaurants around the hotel fgreat for evening dinners and late dinners some kitchen are open until midnight the hotel atmosphere is great and the breakfast was awesome 
471066,Art Hotel Navigli, Parking is 20 per night extra though I doubt that there will be anything else cheaper close by Safe had gone out of battery had to be cut open which took 45min should not have run out of power in the first place but the approach to get to the content was pragmatic and efficient , Excellent location great breakfast Clean and spacious room for 4 Plenty of restaurants not all good though close by Subway station very close Welcome drink and aperitif included 
471067,Art Hotel Navigli, Size restriction policy for dogs the hotel does not welcome dogs over a certain weight which is unfortunate as I often travel with my large dog I d much rather sleep next door to a well behaved large dog than a little unruly one , On site parking
471068,Art Hotel Navigli, We were 3 people in the room so it wasnt very spacious and a bit dark Hair dryer was very old and not working well , i lived in Milan for a year so i selected this hotel on purpose because of its perfect location it is 2 3 min walk to tram metro station You can also walk to Duomo in 20 min Right in front of the hotel there is Rita bar with one of the best cocktails in city They cleaned the room everyday Breakfast was good enough 
471069,Art Hotel Navigli, Only two marks down I gave was for location as the parking situation was a nightmare but I do recognise this is a normality in any every city centre hotel Also 95 per cent of the staff were perfect , I had an excellent stay here The room I had was large and felt very premium The breakfast spread was huge and the hot pancetta was a great addition to it 
471070,Art Hotel Navigli, not much really , The hotel is in the center of the Navigli Area which is a nice quite area with lots of restaurants The hotel is clean modern and well maintained The breakfast is rich and even offers the option to prepare your own carrot juice And the hotel even offers a welcome drink
471071,Art Hotel Navigli, The furniture of some rooms is a little old but the rooms are under renovation , The position in the middle of the nightlife and restaurant area is brilliant Very good breakfast 
471072,Art Hotel Navigli, Facilities are a little run down and old fashioned They need a modern makeover Staff are helpful friendly and efficient and the breakfasts are great Room is small and the bathroom tiny No place to store toiletries But the position is excellent ,No Positive
471073,Art Hotel Navigli, Beds were a little hard and the walls of the rooms too thin lots of noise from adjacent bedrooms , Great location by a trendy canal area with lost of restaurants and shops Also close to M2 metro line for ease of getting into central Milano Free wifi and good choice at breakfast
471074,Art Hotel Navigli, Staff were nice but didn t seem to have much local knowledge No air conditioning available I realise it was cool outside the hotel but the interior of the hotel room was 25 degrees so I think it was a poor choice of the hotel to turn it off , The location was good plenty of restaurants around 
471075,Art Hotel Navigli, Have to say this has been the worst experience that I ve ever had in Milan Given that I travel to Milan every year on business and have stayed in many 4 star hotel this rates poorly The reason been that I booked a non smoking room and then was move to a smaller room which clearly was for one person On complaining my complaints were not directed to someone in charge and if they were then the person in question didn t have the gumption or the manners to speak to me directly shocking My request was that I was not prepared to move again and that the rate should be reduced this was to no avail So you have my vote of 0 and I will make sure this is heard , Nothing 
471076,Art Hotel Navigli, Hotel didn t offer much more than a good location Stay was overall fine only pretty noisy in terms of hearing the cleaning staff and guests in the rooms around you , very good location would definitely recommend this hotel based on that 
471077,Art Hotel Navigli, I did not give full marks for value for money because the price was on the high side This might be due to the EXPO May I suggest that a gym and mini spa is constructed,No Positive
471078,Art Hotel Navigli, Not satisfied with the overall customer service Reception staff was not too kind nor welcoming The hotel does not provide conditioner and body lotion and I was advised from the staff to go to the nearest supermarket to buy some Also they are not able to guarantee the use of an iron when you need it This is not what you expect from a hotel in this price range and not suitable for people travelling on business , I liked the concept the art pieces and the location 
471079,Art Hotel Navigli, The room was tiny The shower as tiny It was overpriced , The breakfast was very good The water pressure was good and hot water plentiful The beds were comfortable 
471080,Art Hotel Navigli, Really really noisy Our rooms were out to the street over the hotel entrance with an unacceptable noise level even with windows closed There are a couple of bars opposite and people outside until well past 2 in the morning Delivery to the supermarket across the street and trash collection starting at 6 am On top of that our rooms 3rd floor were directly under the breakfast room so lots of noise from above from early on as well The climat control in the rooms did not work and it was hot and stuffy a real problem when one cannot open the window , The location is nice and central Many restaurants and bars to choose from The hotel rooms were clean and well equipped Beds comfortable Breakfast is really good and a lot of choice including fresh fruit and eggs 
471081,Art Hotel Navigli, The half hour walk to the Cuomo was more like an hour Hotel is difficult to get to even with a GPS , The Hotel is truly full of some pretty good art and we are collectors Neat area for restaurants good for young people 
471082,Art Hotel Navigli, We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights For the first day they offer us room 101 the room was very old dirty the shower was very weak and the water went to all different directions unable to wash your hair nothing like you see from the photos definitely not what a 4 star hotel would offer The next morning we requested to change the room they moved us to a room on the second floor the room was bright and clean We paid the same amount of money for both nights we have no idea why the 2 rooms can be so different , Location was good lots of restaurants that opened till late
471083,Art Hotel Navigli, Nothing, Big room and very comfortable bed Large bathroom but bit dated Great breakfast selection and very friendly staff The location is fantastic Make sure you visit the food markets nearby Easy to get to the centre Would definitely stay here next time There are loads of great bars and restaurants on the doorstep and the whole region is buzzing at night If you get the bus from the airport it s only 5euros to the central rail station Buy your tickets at the bus not inside the airport Quite expensive for a taxi from the central station though so get the underground it s really cheap 
471084,Art Hotel Navigli, Hard to find the hotel when driving ourselves It wasn t clear you could drive down the road with the camera , Bathroom Garden Welcome drink aperitivo breakfast LOCATION for going out in the evening 
471085,Art Hotel Navigli, WIFI limted at 400MB Makes no sense Could not download a movie for the kids Breakfast was nice but the room was really warm and the AC was not put on, good location if you want to be close to the Navigli good set up for a family we had a 2 bedroom for a decent price this hotel was one of the only one not asking for absurd prices during the EXPO Well done good business ethics Will come back only for this attitude 
471086,Art Hotel Navigli, What I really dont like about this hotel the staff memebers They should be more friendly as nice 4 star hotel specially in the reception , The hotel was nice almost everythig was good Location was ok
