168654,H tel De Castiglione, We would rather have a sink and running water in the toilet , The location was extremely good The staff were very friendly and professional The room was very nice The bathroom was very spacious We will certainly stay on the this hotel next time we visit Paris I do recommend it for people who wish to visit Paris and stay closer to everything 
168655,H tel De Castiglione, Arrived at 8pm and my room was still not ready I was told to return 30mins later and that they would try their best Lamp next to my bed would randomly switch on whilst asleep Perhaps an electrical wiring glitch , Comfortable room
168656,H tel De Castiglione, The whole place seems to have been in constant dissarray for years and the only work done has been conducted by amateurs The halway carpers are so dirty and worn out that made me sick The room was dirty like the whole place lamps hanging moldy bathroom grime in the shower carpet that was just cut an laid to rest horrible place which should not be open for business , Nothing
168657,H tel De Castiglione, Hotel is under renovation entrance reception is looking awful Room is run down Elevator is very small and gets stuck Stuff is very rude and not helpful ,No Positive
168658,H tel De Castiglione, There is revolution work and small reception They kick my family out of room because they stay on 1 more than check out time Small crorador and trase is shared between all rooms without partion Small elevator , Only the location 
168659,H tel De Castiglione, I have booked triple room and expected to get three single beds Instead of three single beds I had two single beds and one extra beds which was not very comfortable than a single bed , The location is really good and staffs are really kind Breakfast was okay 
168660,H tel De Castiglione, A bit more cleaning would do , What a wonderful staff A big thank you to Loredana Lina and another lovely lady at the reception I do not know the name of sorry The view is spectacular The terace could be taken a bit more care of a really ugly flower box with dead flowers and a pile of hose pipes in the corner But all compensate for a superb location and the best staff 
168661,H tel De Castiglione, The breakfast is very basic It is just ok Renovation is being done in the hotel there is no lobby because it is being renovated There is no lunch or dinner they have no chief the breakfast is brought from another place There is only small left and you gave to climb stairs to reach it I guess that It must be the service left and the main left is in the area being renovated , Excellent location It is only 10 15 minutes from Concord place Taxes and public transport are available and can be easily reached A good grocery is about 200 m from the hotel most of the famous fashions brands have stores on the same street staff are mostly friendly and offer help when needed
168662,H tel De Castiglione, The staff there are thieves We checked out in the morning and left 2 DIOR suits in the wardrobe and an HERMES sandal but when we came back to collect it the staff told us they couldn t find it and even called the manager but she said they didn t find anything We told them we were going to call the police and the manager even told us not to bother as it was late in the night They told us many times to com back the next morning to check with Housekeeping When we actually did call the police to report in front of them the manager immediately took all my stuff down My shoes were actually in the box and all labels when Thye returned it to me it was without the box so they had the intention to keep it , Location was convenient
168663,H tel De Castiglione, The worse experience ever in a hotel in my life Hotel under Construction No main entrance No lobby No reception Poor elevator No room cleaning No room service Noise from workers in the corridors Poor room We reserve our rights for further action,No Positive
168664,H tel De Castiglione, It is 4 hotel but it is not look like even 2 Staff which are cleaning rooms does not speak English I gave to laundry clothes they lost 2 items and insisted that they returned everything and argued with me that I miscalculated Finally the laundry brought my missed items when I was catching a taxi And laundry costs unbelievable money If you are going to stay long time take by yourself to laundry Coffee wasn t taste of coffee No variety of omelettes only two kind scrambled or boiled Also hotel is under renovation and only one microscope lift is working only one person with one luggage may enter Next visit definitely I will not choose that hotel What is this , Only location
168665,H tel De Castiglione, The hotel is old and the room is totally different on web picture It is still under renovation and i will consider not to stay here again Lift is only one life and too compact ,No Positive
168666,H tel De Castiglione, The hotel is currently under renovation so you are staying inside a construction site That says it all For the price you pay you should be at least warned Very disappointed , the location nothin else
168667,H tel De Castiglione, The breakfast room didn t have air conditioning and it was a bit hot, The bedroom and bathroom seemed to have been recently refurbished and everything looked new 
168668,H tel De Castiglione, The hotel did not look like the the pictures on bookings com they are busy with a refurb that we weren t informed about the air conditioner in our room did not work this in the midst of a heatwave in France , Liked location
168669,H tel De Castiglione, No power outlets next to the bed on Friday night there might be some noise if you want to sleep with your window open but if you close it and turn on the AC it s all good very good isolation, Bed was very comfy Very clean room Great shower Position is great walking distance to the Louvre Place Vendome Place de la Madelaine Champs Elysee built in USB charging station 
168670,H tel De Castiglione, The fact that we were NOT informed that we were paying good money to stay on a building site There was and still is until August they hope a major refurbishment taking place Were YOU aware of that The dirt noise inconvenience and general chaos is totally unacceptable The entrance to the hotel is now hidden down a side street and we only found it thanks to the maitre d of a nearby restaurant There is only one working lift servicing 8 floors which is rated to carry four people but only if they are super slim and have no luggage with them In addition to which it was quite evident that the housekeeping staff were jamming the doors open from time to time for their own convenience The room was properly serviced and cleaned only ONCE during our stay and on one occasion it took three phone calls over a 1 hour period to obtain a missing second bath towel and a bath mat Why they had been taken away in the first place remains a mystery , Excellent location and ONE of the reception staff was extremely helpful 
168671,H tel De Castiglione, The hotel is under construction and does not meet the luxury standard set by the advertisement I m guessing it will be great once construction is complete until then try another property For the money it isn t worth it , The coffee was decent
168672,H tel De Castiglione, Scrambled eggs didn t taste good Even the colour didn t look right The 4 slice toaster didn t work had to wait there and watch that the toast didn t stay in too long and burn Would have liked to see whole wheat sliced bread and oatmeal cereal being offered Some people may not mind a soft mattress or perhaps not like a firm mattress However my back really needs a firm mattress so I didn t sleep well at all the first few nights Fortunately the rooms are large enough so I decided to put the twin mattress on the floor and after that my back didn t hurt anymore The mattress and box spring really need to be replaced in the bedrooms Bathrooms need upgrading so shower stall has walls all around it and bathtubs need to have a shower curtain or sliding glass doors to avoid splashing water all over the bathroom floor Not all sinks had working stoppers so some sinks couldn t hold water Our bathroom door didn t close shut in our room but it did in our daughter s room There is no exhaust fan in the bathroom so the towels take a long time to dry There really needs to be more than just 2 hand towels in a double room Website really needs to let people know that facecloths are not provided for those who just want to wash their face and hands to freshen up or to wipe up the water on the sink and counter , Breakfast was very good except for the scrambled eggs Good variety of choices to select from fruit jam croissants cereal juice coffee ham cheese breads etc were fresh and excellent quality The Egg bread and different jams were delicious Water pressure in the rooms were very good for taking a bath or flushing the toilet Should upgrade the toilets to use less water Room size and bathroom size are a nice good size with plenty of room to move around especially compared to all the other surrounding hotels We had large closets with two full length sliding mirrors and large built in shelves Large writing desk with chair and a chair with round table in a sitting area in front of the window large dresser by door was convenient to set things down when entering leaving the room Large dining room with large attractive windows that open to let in a cool breeze on the main floor for eating breakfast Last year our friend stayed in a hotel which had a very small room but everything was new and modern but his biggest complaint was everything was so small the room and bathroom was only large enough for 1 person although it was considered a double room Currently Hotel Castiglione is currently under renovations and will be completed in 2017 and then it will be a much more pleasant experience especially if they keep the large rooms which is an advantage over all the other local hotels in central Paris Having breakfast included with the superior room is a good price We wish the breakfast option was offered with the deluxe rooms too We decided we would rather have the breakfast option rather than the terrace balcony view Large well lit bathroom mirror and double sink 
168673,H tel De Castiglione, We were not informed that there was a refurbishment going on and there were no bar or restaurant facilities , The location was excellent for visiting the sights of Paris 
168674,H tel De Castiglione, The entire hotel was a building site They should close the hotel and finish refurbishment The state of the hotel was shocking for the price paid, The refurbished room was very nice
168675,H tel De Castiglione, First impressions reminded my of a hostel , Location was perfect for my meeting and good value for the area of Paris Room was also a pleasant surprise compared to communal areas
168676,H tel De Castiglione, Lack of variety for breakfast No restaurant for meals Charged my card for one night stay although hotel has claimed this was only a block Since this was a fully cancellable booking till 6 pm on day of arrival the charge was levied 2 days prior to arrival The block still not reversed although full payment has been made and my credit card statement still carrying the charge Will wait 2 days and if not cleared then will need to follow up with the property Room numbers 687 688 , Central location staff special mention for Caesar 
168677,H tel De Castiglione, The hotel was under going renovations so the reception area is quite sparse We would have liked more secluded seating areas The lift was tiny suppose to hold 4 people but never saw more than 2 at a time , The hotel was in a great location very near the metro which was very easy to use The breakfast was good and plentiful 
168678,H tel De Castiglione, We arrived at 7 a m for check in the lady on the reception advised us that there is no room available till 2 p m in the afternoon We told her that when booking we mentioned our arrival time She answered I have no room available and you should have booked one night earlier We told her that we always book thru Booking com at the intercontinental or Regency and we always arrive same timing we never faced such a situation We sat on uncomfortable chairs in what they call it a lobby It was very humilating to sleep on the chairs as we ve been very tired flying all night At 9 a m one gentleman came to the reception he did not like our seen sleeping on the chairs He talked to the lady then she came to us and said now there is a room available but you have to pay 50 Euro Without any discusssion my husband paid the 50 Euros and we took the room If this is the,No Positive
168679,H tel De Castiglione, Property under construction elevator extremely small had to wait for access Would recommend staying on a lower floor for easier access , Location breakfast large room comfortable beds
168680,H tel De Castiglione, The room was very old fashion small not clean and there were huge holes in the white curtains room 692 , The staff at the reception were friendly and helpful
168681,H tel De Castiglione, didn t like how they wanted to charge an extra 50 euros just to check in at 10am even though we always book at that same hotel for our meetings in Paris, very nice room spacious and clean
168682,H tel De Castiglione, Very small room Old room and almost broken 710 2 reading lights not working Sharing balcony Very slow staff Since the hotel is in maintenance the price suppose to be less than this price Bad elevator fit for 3 small people If you order iron you have to wait for 1 hour , Fast internet Location 
168683,H tel De Castiglione, service is sucks its not safe my friend bag got stolen inside the room its really scary and the hotel management not really good in dealing with this situation they are also very rude and they don t have a restaurant inside the room there are no refrigerator while they claim they have , location only close to the place i want to go
168684,H tel De Castiglione, The hotel is undergoing MAJOR renovations with lots of concrete dust and a very poor reception and welcome area We felt the pictures on booking com and ratings were very misleading Especially when the rates reflect the unrenovated rooms which are very poor value The newly renovated rooms are spectacular let down by a hotel under major renovation, The initial room was extremely old and In need of renovation It s redeeming feature was a view of the Effiel Tower They did on our initial complaint allow us to upgrade to an extremely well presented room of five star quality At a cost of an additional 70 Euro night which we had little option due to cancellation costs 
168685,H tel De Castiglione, Location and breakfast , Very old dirty needs major renavation to all of it It feels the owners do not want to I nvest in it and milking every penny out of it It just too old and dirty not maintained at all Too bad because the location is amazing but it nor worth to stay in there 
168686,H tel De Castiglione, The breakfast was not great the elevator way too small and The fire alarm would sometimes go on in the Morning for no reason , The room was very very big and we had a closet a comfy couch and a bathtub Very close to the center 
168687,H tel De Castiglione, The hotel is having renovation done although that wasn t really an inconvenience to us Only one mirror in the bathroom No milk in the room for tea or coffee, Great stay Breakfast was good bed was very comfortable fantastic area very close to all the tourist sights Thankyou for a great stay
168688,H tel De Castiglione, The hotel is currently undergoing renovation One of the elevators had been shut down so it took a while to access the ground floor but the hotel will be great value for money once the work is complete , Excellent location Very friendly and helpful staff Spacious and clean room Will definite look no further on our next visit 
168689,H tel De Castiglione,No Negative, This hotel was in rebuilding and the lobby was a small room with a little desk there was no hotel bar and the elvator the guests have to use was elvator for the staff which means that it only allow two people and on bag and futhermore the lift was always ocupied The brekafast was simular to 2 hotels so I will never used this hotel again but good location and frendly staff 
168690,H tel De Castiglione, everything bad the treatment the outlook of the hotel the way of treating the customers, I m a frequent traveler and i travel a lot around the world and its the worst experience that i faced on my life as when i arrived there they receptionist told me that we don t have room available and imagine that i have already paid and they have deducted the full amount from my card with no refunding me then they have transferred to other hotel and they were chasing me in removing such facilities as breakfast and other in order to have a quiet bigger room as we reached there at 10 00pm and we were exhausted so we don t have chance to look after other hotel i don t consider this hotel as 4 star its not a t all believe me its only 2 star hotel bad treatment bad lobby and a construction work was going on even i told them that i m going to write about your hotel in booking com although the location is good but the rooms and the facilities not at all the same as the posted pictures in the website 
168691,H tel De Castiglione, the pictures on the website are misleading since the hotel is in a renovation they should have mentioned that and notify that the breakfast won t be served at the dining room as given also its variety of choices weren t complimentary to all no veggies or fruit at all ,No Positive
168692,H tel De Castiglione, We were not informed that the hotel was under renovation and was a mess with sections of the roof completely exposed and dust everywhere The breakfast was shocking The staff were unfriendly and unhelpful and couldn t really care less The food ran out an hour before breakfast finished on our first morning and we were told that the chef wouldn t make more We were there for the Paris marathon and while the hotel did open breakfast earlier for the runners the hot food was not ready , Location excellent room good 
168693,H tel De Castiglione, Disaster Don t ruin your day with this hotel Pity welcome at front desk door key doesn t work since the first day old building in bad condition bad insulation dirty room with hairs in the sink smelly toilette bad room service staff enter in your room without your permission without excuse extra charging check well your invoice before your payment they will charge you even you took nothing from minibar staff threw away my personal things Trust me you have much more hotel choices in Paris Don t waste your money on this hotel , X
168694,H tel De Castiglione, There is only 1 lift and is small so sometimes one has to wait for it especially at breakfast time Other than that everything is perfect , We love the location very close to anzelize Louvre La fayette Arc De trump etc and the staff of the hotel was freindly and very helpful Mr Sezar who helped us to carry our luggages was kind and he spoked few langugages i e italian turkish english which is just perfect Also at the reception Mr Hassan was very helpful The breakfast was rich too The Hotel is just excellent 
168695,H tel De Castiglione, Nothing in the hotel It was a poor hotel , It was contrary to my expectation It looked like a two or three star hotel It was far from a 4 star hotel 
168696,H tel De Castiglione, The hotel was under construction on arrival I would like to have been made aware of this before hand Not a very good experience at Hotel De castiglione,No Positive
168697,H tel De Castiglione,No Negative, The hotel is currently going through a major renovation refit which meant you felt like you were in a bit of a building site The two main lifts didnt work so the very small max 2 person service lift was the only way of accessing the floors hence big queues But all this will no doubt be sorted and it will be very good when work completed Excellent staff very helpful and friendly I had room on 8th floor and was very clean and very comfortable Excellent Superb location
168698,H tel De Castiglione, I booked this hotel online after I checked the details to make sure it offered room service When I arrived at the hotel I found it was under construction and no room service was available All hotels need to update their information when any works are going on at the premises which affect what is offered on their web site , The location was superb 
168699,H tel De Castiglione,No Negative, The Hotel staff were brilliant friendly and supportive It is located in a great area close to all the famous monuments and is also close to quaint little cafes for people that are wanting to experience French food and culture that is only a short walk away 
168700,H tel De Castiglione, We had an emergency and wanted to cancel our reservation and there was absolutely no flexibility or decency with regards to the staff it was horrible Also the pictures are nothing like the real rooms absolutely nothing , The breakfast and location were great
168701,H tel De Castiglione, The service was terrible They moved us to another room without telling us they just took our bags so when we got back the room had other guests already Aside from that the elevators were so slow and the people weren t so accommodating, The breakfast was good The location is nice for shopping at high end stores 
168702,H tel De Castiglione, The Hotel entrance was very poor Breakfast area was so small And the staff werent enough to serve in the morning We waited 10 minutes for the bread 20 eu was too much for this Otherwise it was good , Location was very good Close to everywhere Room was large and nice Largest room in Paris after 20 times 
168703,H tel De Castiglione, The lock on the bathroom door was faulty and my wife was unable to get out for about an hour I was out and there was no phone in the bathroom I tried it when I got back and I could not open it either Whilst having breakfast I saw the member of staff the girl with long hair who was putting out some fresh croissants etc drop a Pain au chocolate on the floor when she had finished putting the others out she also discreetly put the one from the floor out with the others Apart from the girl and guy on the reception all the staff seemed to be miserable , The room was very nice and quite spacious for Paris The location was very good and correct for the price 
168704,H tel De Castiglione, The reception area and communal areas need a re vamp The elevator is very slow A message to let my partner who arrived after me in to my room was unfortunately not transmitted but otherwise the stay was comfortable and pleasant , The staff were friendly and my room was superb with views over the rooftops of Paris Clean and very quiet 
168705,H tel De Castiglione, Website stated an indoor pool and free parking that was not true Wifi was slow, We got an upgrade to a large room that also had a sitting area the bathroom had a large shower and a bathtub The location was awesome we were close to shopping and the metro The beds were like sleeping on clouds and we could not hear any noise from our room
168706,H tel De Castiglione, First of all the room is very small and old Room service is always late about 6pm and they don t change shampoo and soap Conditioner doesn t work and you have to open the window in order to have ability to breathe but it s very noisy at the street so you can t sleep with the open window Bed is small for two people Breakfast is bad Wouldn t recommend it , Location is good near all touristic spots Staff is friendly especially concierge Caesar 
168707,H tel De Castiglione, Breakfast could have more flair The offer is adequate but presentation is lacking and the dining room is frankly triste , The beds are really good and the rooms spacious The renovated rooms have a modern look without being cold while the non renovated ones have an oldies charm The isolation is good no neighbour noise and for Paris standards the rooms are really clean 
168708,H tel De Castiglione, The hotel is run down Corridor carpets completely worn out One lift out of order throughout all stay Transferred to a refurbished room No hanger in bathroom No luggage bench Hot and cold water irregular flow in shower Spent a lot of money with poor results, Staff were helpful Location is eccellent Size of room ok
168709,H tel De Castiglione, Hotel could use a lot of updating in the common spaces Carpet in the room could use updating but the room was very spacious with high quality linnens and soft towels Large flat screen in the room with large sitting area and work space was very luxurious , Room was very nice we were upgraded to a junior suite with a walk in closet large bathroom with full tub and separate shower Our room was on the west side of the building on the 6th floor with a view of the Eifel Tower Great value for the money 
168710,H tel De Castiglione, I was surprised that the room was cleaned in the late afternoon I had walked around Paris all day and was expecting to relax on my return to the room and take a bath and then relax with a glass of wine But there was a knock on the door at around 5 pm for the cleaning to be done I could have said no but good customer service is about providing a service that is not intrusive on the customer Another surprise was that I needed to make an international call and the automated machine response was that this feature was not authorised When I spoke with Reception it was suggested that I had dialled incorrectly I don t mean to undermine staff but I informed them that I had followed instructions and was given an impatient look by one of them The other came up to my room and tried the number I needed to phone and the machine gave him the same response It was suggested that I might like to make my call from the reception phone for a couple of minutes I explained that it was a personal call and I didn t want to make it in a public area I was expecting the fault to be fixed and I am aware that they called in technicians but they were apparently unable to fix the problem I asked 3 times on different days but I was never able to make a private call to the overseas number Disappointing customer service , The room was very comfortable and quiet so it was easy to relax 
168711,H tel De Castiglione, The reception area is quite small for such a star hotel , The staff at restaurant during breakfast were very helpful Clean rooms Great location closer to many attractions at Paris 
168712,H tel De Castiglione, If you want to go out there is not much around hotel but two Buddha bars around corner and road closed partly for security reasons with presence of lots of polices around Not very fancy stay but practical and very ok for the price and location , Peaceful stay on a chick road Huge shower was great and I liked the breakfast and was happy to stay in a quite room far from building works at hotel 
168713,H tel De Castiglione, The hotel is a bit old and in need of renovation but absolutely good enough for a short stay The breakfast is a bit simle but okej , The rooms with balcony on the 8th floor are amazing Quiet rooms The hotel has a perfect location 
168714,H tel De Castiglione, We made our reservation because of the offer they announced but we felt cheated as the hotel was under constructions Saturday at 8 o clock in the morning the sound of a hammer woke us The room was also full of dusty because of this construction When we returned from having lunch they continued with the hammer unbearable I hardy don t recommend this hotel , El hotel est bien situado
168715,H tel De Castiglione, Some steps at the entrance of the hotel Difficult to access with a buggy or with big suit cases , Had booked a standard triple room but the hotel upgraded us to a very spacious room The bed was very comfortable the bathroom was big with a great shower and the room was quiet 
168716,H tel De Castiglione, The ladies at reception were lovely and welcoming and always helpful One of the others on duty as we arrived was clearly having a bad day but the lady helping us did her best to work around his outbursts , Brilliant location and absolutely loved the tiny balcony with the amazing views Perfect 
168717,H tel De Castiglione, Had problem with reservation but staff was able to correct quickly Would be nice if the room service offered food for the nights that you re too tired to go out for dinner , Very nice accommodations and a beautiful balcony 
168718,H tel De Castiglione, The reception area and the elevators , The roon was clean and comfortable We were in one of the rooms that had been very recently rennovated Most of the staff were friendly and responded quickly to all our requests Wonderful location naking it easy to get around 
168719,H tel De Castiglione, Around 2055 QR 150 has been stolen from my hand bag pocket which was left in the room The money was kept in the handbag pocket with a zipper the money was taken by a person has a key and comfortable to access the room I informed the receiption and hope they take a serious action , The little location
168720,H tel De Castiglione, Decor in public area is below par and in dire need of refurbishment Cleaning staff is very good and polite Breakfast team was not up to the big number of visitors One female member of staff behind the counter was particularly French and unhelpfull First four nights there was much and loud ncturnal activity Almost as if some pro ladies were using this as a hub Staff acted correctly and it stayed quiet the rest of the nights , Room was refurbished and had a very good shower and bathroomfacilities Airco is excellent and keeps cool with little noise Philips back light led tv was hardly used Good wifi 
168721,H tel De Castiglione, 1 WiFi was too bad 2 Dark spot in bathtub 3 Can t take regular shower as the water will cover the ground 4 I am 6ft and and was not comfortable using the toilet seat as it was too high for average people No human standers in design , Staff were nice
168722,H tel De Castiglione, Common facilities are quite worn down corridors and entrance feel like they are in need of a good renovation Wifi was free but the configuration chosen meant that I could never have my firewall agree to it never happened before, Very friendly staff helpful and available Rooms are clean Air conditioning was efficient 
168723,H tel De Castiglione, Do not stay here Bed bugs in our first room Totally disorganised hotel Breakfast run out and they would not even restock bread Coffee in room we stayed 4 nights and was provided with 2 bags of freeze dried coffee the first night after that it was 3 5 Euro per bag The whole hotel is a building site , Nothing the hotel is a joke 
168724,H tel De Castiglione, It s the third time that I book at the Catiglione The first time I was given one of the renovated rooms It was just superb Then it went downhill I was expecting to be rewarded for my loyalty not to be send in 1960 However the staff and the location compensate the discomfort , The staff I d just superb helpful and caring The location is second to none The street is very safe It is between the Elysee Palace the British and the American Embassy could not be more secure 
168725,H tel De Castiglione, everything is nice and i cant tell negative amazing hotel, the hotel is brilliant and the staff friendly and the room clean and elegant location in heart of Paris love this hotel i will back to book again
168726,H tel De Castiglione, This is not a Hotle at all this property not suppose to be at Booking com portal it s not deserve it s very bad service in this money we could get much better place and good location, This is not a Hotle at all this property not suppose to be at Booking com portal it s not deserve it s very bad service in this money we could get much better place and good location
168727,H tel De Castiglione, Comfortable and central, The best place for all the attractions but a little tired Could do with a make over but would probably push the bargain prices up
168728,H tel De Castiglione, Room was tired Needs work done urgently but still very comfortable Expected to pay a lot more for where it is located among the top fashion shops in Paris , Staff very helpful and location is excellent
168729,H tel De Castiglione, H tel very hold hotel its look like 2 starts small room bathroom dirty Not functional Ploukistan hotel , The location is very good near to the shop quiet at night
168730,H tel De Castiglione, No room service Restaurant and bar are very average Simply not a 4 star No gym , Staff is helpfull and very very nice trying the best for your stay in this strange not a 4 star hotel 
168731,H tel De Castiglione, Alot Just because it s on this very chic street famed for it s designer boutiques this hotel really does not belong there Firstly I arrived and told my room ready When I opened the door to my room I was met by a sour faced looking woman who didn t even say hello just told me abruptly j arrive tout suite After I waited she left the room and looked again at me rather sour faced Not a great start at all The room smelt strange It looked clean enough but I could see they are not doing such a great job of cleaning it properly My first night was that bad that i actually did not stay the second and stayed with a friend I was woken up at 3am with the people in the room above consistently moving the electrical outside shutters up and down Then I could here a noise inside the cupboard where the mini bar was I lay still listening and I realised it was a mouse or something else I got up and switched on the light and called reception immediately The noise stopped as soon as i put on the light and was moving I ve had mice in a previous flat before I know that as soon as a light goes on or they hear feel movement they go very still Anyway the guy came quickly and checked but he didn t check behind the minibar but assured me there was nothing there I kept the light on the rest of the night and didn t get any sleep The hotel is old and in need of some major refurbishment On my floor there was trolleys for the cleaners everywhere and bags and it was really unpleasant Unlike in other hotels the cleaning ladies were just miserable and rude It just created a bad feeling coupled with a smelly room whcih potentially has vermin lingering around The price was almost 150 euros a night which was ridiculous Don t anybody be fooled by the road it s on and the pictures they put as their main picture They only apply to their more expensive rooms , The location on Rue de Faubourg St Honore The staff on reception were good professional and polite 
168732,H tel De Castiglione, Nothing, Location is right on the shopping road The entry of hotel look little old but the room is really really big and modern and very clean With that price can t find other hotel with big room and clean like that Sure will get back again to this hotel 
168733,H tel De Castiglione,No Negative, Very nice hotel good location nice staff it s my third time in this hotel Good connection wifi English French speaker The baby bed was ready in the room and they made our room available in the morning 
168734,H tel De Castiglione, The breakfast not much choice with bun ham cheese coffee and tea only, It s the excellent location for who like to shopping in Paris which beside of Hermes Chanel and others branding shop 
168735,H tel De Castiglione, The room was much smaller than our last stay Could hear other guests Had to fix the bath plug and the sink tap should have been replaced long ago , Location incredible Room very well presented Lovely staff on the desk particularly Marie and the man who helped with our bags 
168736,H tel De Castiglione, Very outdated Noisy from 7am The sheets looked as if they are 10 years old and used without washing Tea and coffee available in the room for extra charge Only the first cup is free No pen and paper no vanity or sewing kits I wonder how they can have 4 stars I would rate it 2 stars , Only the location
168737,H tel De Castiglione, It would be appreciate if there were more hot food in breakfast , It s a pleasant travel in Paris The hotel is on a very safe and smart street We got upgrade room for free The room is new and big The receptor is so nice I think I will come again 
168738,H tel De Castiglione, common areas of the hotel look quite tired in need of a facelift , very spacious and clean room and bathroom super central location nice breakfast
168739,H tel De Castiglione, Corridors and common travelling areas look tired and need a refresh , The terrace view of Paris from the 8th floor The terrace itself could have been smartened up but the view was good 
168740,H tel De Castiglione, missed having a kettle in the room for tea fancy coffee maker with pods which you had to pay extra for if you ran out awkward to dispense the shower bath gel and shampoo from square bottles, fantastic location walking distance to Champs Elysees bars and restaurants bed was extremely comfortable bath was deep and wide and long making for a lovely soak at the end of a tiring day sightseeing brilliant wifi connection friendly staff superior room was large and very comfortable
168741,H tel De Castiglione, Everything was an absolute disappointment to the point I had to change hotel in the middle of my stay This is far from being a 4 stars hotel wouldn t even give one star It s dirty old noisy the breakfast is terrible wifi is poor and they were doing works I would not recommend this hotel at all and I strongly recommend that if the work are for renovation that they close the hotel during renovation because it is a shame , The location
168742,H tel De Castiglione, Paying for sachets of instant coffe and teabags Worn and torn carpet let decor down Trolley of linen outside room the entire weekend , Bathroom
168743,H tel De Castiglione, We had an issue with the cleaning service We left the sign for the staff to clean up our room but when we came back the room wasn t done and the sign was turned the other way do not disturb That could be an honest mistake but what did bother me was that on the day we were leaving the staff came to our door and knock on it at 09 30 to check if the room was ready to be made why didn t they do that the first day and check if we needed the room clean It felt that they wanted the room quickly that last day , It s at a good location not far to walk to different parts of the city 
168744,H tel De Castiglione, Breakfast sad looking set up and atmosphere The lobby very small There are 2 tiny lifts and seems like it might break down or stop at any time , Location If you are in Paris for shopping This is one of the location to stay The new Prestige room is good and the pillows are great I was given an old room and immediately ask for check out Then I was given the mentioned room Wi fi is good through out the property and the whole stay
