82576,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The room was quite small and the bed was tiny for my partner and I , The breakfast was lovely and in a nice part of the hotel It s in the museum area so it s close to everything 
82577,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Front of hotel is difficult to identify due to scaffolding as renovations are in progress Drinks prices are a bit silly e g A spritzer bottle of water and a coffee pushed my 25 three course evening meal bill to 54 including service charge , Staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful Very comfortable room Good quality food
82578,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, I was struggling with adjust the room temperature and ended up lack of sleep I regret using the restaurant for a dinner , the furniture near to a park quiet area
82579,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Building was covered in scaffolding which we were not informed of before arrival No discount was offered for lack of privacy views Rooms old tired bed very uncomfortable Breakfast food good but overpriced so not value for money, Fantastic location
82580,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The only rooms with two beds are right by the lift so we had a lot of noise from returning Royal Albert concert goers , The perfect floor plan and well thought out storage made our small room feel spacious and easy to keep pretty looking The huge light bathroom was glorious after all the dangerous cramped facilities in our other hotels All meals we ate in the restaurant were as pretty to look at as they were delicious We had the duck mousse with rhubarb jam twice 
82581,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The Gore has a great potential The locations is steps away from Hyde Park Royal Albert Hall and the Museums Unfortunately at the time of my visit the facade was under renovations with scaffold all the way covering the windows without letting me know There was either no privacy or I had to keep the windows closed and covered The pluming needs work the shower had either cold or hot water but not the mixed one It made is impossible to use it The sink did not drain properly Small things but makes the difference The biggest problem came at dinner time They not only hurry us up we dine at 10 after the Prom concerts and they knew it but I was also overcharged and had to dispute the bill the next day Quality of food was good but too bad if you finish the dinner like this The room was good nice size good quality but on the top floor and access was difficult no elevator However the staff was friendly and made the luggage trip easier I wish I did not get disappointed by the dinner bill and by the fact that somehow a hotel should inform upfront its clients if construction works are being done during the booking ,No Positive
82582,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, No fault of the hotel but the building exterior is currently surrounded by scaffolding so could get noisy as work is being done Hopefully the hotel will look fresh and new once the work is all complete , The room was cosy with lots of period features and extravagant furnishings Booked this hotel as it was near to Hyde park and also around the corner from the Albert Hall 
82583,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, It was under renovation so after 8 30am it was a bit loud and we needed to keep the curtains shut Wifi was very slow I resorted to my LTE connection over the phone , Amazing place Amazing location and very nice staff Already booked it again 
82584,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The room wasn t ready although we arrived half an hour after the designated check in time we were on a strict time schedule so this was unhelpful to say the least as we wanted to change and freshen up before going out again and we were encouraged to have a drink in the bar while we waited at our own not inconsiderable expense The room was very small and much of the natural light was blocked out by the extensive scaffolding that covered the entire building In addition to boil the kettle it was necessary to plug it in almost at floor level as the waist high sockets were all non compatible continental style The wi fi is hit and miss , The bed was extremely comfortable The concierge was very friendly and the common interior parts of the hotel are beautiful Breakfast little more than adequate 
82585,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Way too expensive, Unfortunately the lovely pictures of the property raised my expectations Musty and smelly Poor staff w poor English speaking skills Unable to have the Room I actually booked Seriously overpriced
82586,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, No warning that the hotel was covered in scaffolding and that some rooms were being worked on Also the carpet in our room had some bad stains on Not what you d expect from this class of hotel , This is a very cosy hotel with a very atmospheric bar and excellent restaurant The room had a very comfortable bed and excellent blackout curtains 
82587,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Most hotels hotels at this price range offer free water wider range of teas biscuits etc A very minor gripe but it seems a little stingy , Amazing history 1890 s hotel with well designed decor to fit the period Beggars banquet launch party was held here Convenient for Albert hall Fabulous oak bedstead looked like early Liberty gothic arts and crafts 
82588,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The water tempetature was a little difficult to get right , The staff were excellent Our room was nice and the bed quite comfortable It was lovely and quiet on the top floor 
82589,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The first room we were given was very badly layed out Having had a busy day we wanted to spend a quiet evening in our room and watch the TV However due to the TV being positioned in a recess we could not see the full screen plus the view was further obstructed by one of the bed posts In fact the only place one could actually view the full screen of the tv was by sitting on the desk which was clearly not acceptable After speaking to reception we were offered an alternative room which was better however the bed was so high my wife had to use a chair to get in it I am almost 6 foot tall and I even found it a struggle to get into bed There was also a dreadfully disturbing repeated sound of running water which appeared to be coming from pipes or drains within wall cavities I contacted the duty manager at 10 30pm and she came to the room and agreed the noise was dreadful The overall experience was certainly not what I would have expected considering the room rate I was paying On checkout we were given a 10 discount off our bill but as our stay was intended to be a treat for my wife s birthday the experience fell well short of our expectations , All the staff tried to be helpful and the location is good 
82590,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Refrigirator in the room not working no drawer to put underwear and others Personally we found the price of 867 93 to expensive for 3 nights Bathroom very small Walking distance to far from the Tube 1 km , Breakfast and diner very good 190 Bar pleasant employee very kind and helpful
82591,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The only thing I didn t like was long life UHT milk to have a tea in your room and a couple more vegetarian options for room service would have been fab , Gorgeous decor the bed was very comfortable and the best part the shower The building had scaffolding up so it took a while to actually find 
82592,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The first two rooms had bad stains on the carpet and we re tiny so they upgraded us to a super room Hotel was wrapped in plastic with men working outside so you couldn t open the drapes How do you think that was And no discount offered , The location to Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park was excellent Nice Resturant and pub
82593,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Cleanliness wasn t brilliant The fridge of mini bar was not working Breakfast was too expensive 32 each so we ate outside the hotel It was meant to be a non smoking hotel but someone in the room opposite had smoked and the smell had come into our room There was scaffolding outside our room but we realise work has to be done some time , Great location for Royal Albert Hall concert we d booked That was the reason for booking the Gore Hotel literally 1 2 minute walk 
82594,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, All Good, Clean friendly great loc to the albert hall as we were going to see a concert plenty of places to eat and drink in the area underground 10 min walk from hotel 
82595,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, The room was small building works are taking place so scaffolding every where on returning from a concert Sunday evening 10 45 ish we were unable to get a drink and we re informed room service would be an hour or two Breakfast whilst good was very very slow 1 2 hour for egg on toast 
82596,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Carpet in our room was dirty and worn Their was an external renovation going on which we were unaware of until we showed up At check in their was confusion regarding additional charges for full breakfast which were supposed to be included in our rate I had to provide the online booking com receipt to prove it was included Some staff were unfriendly and not very helpful , The concierge services were excellent very helpful Location perfect Breakfast very good 
82597,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, room small and very dark and looking out of date Also scaffolding outside window so no view was only told this on our way up to the room shame really had expected more , convenient location
82598,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Don t expect all mod cons , There is a lovely library room and bar for guests to relax in and the decor is plush and grand It feels a little bit like a private club or that you have stepped back in time Real attention to detail 
82599,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, We do not normally pay this much when we stay in a hotel but the location in London and the cleanliness and comfort level add a lot It s a splurge for us and we just accept the fact that s where we ll stay when we come We re guaranteed a good night s sleep and a good breakfast to start the day , We met several friends there for breakfast one morning It was an ideal location to sit and talk and the buffet allowed everyone to casually get what they wanted along with a hot dish should they prefer 
82600,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Nothing, Proximity to the Royal Albert Hall Olde worlde feel to the hotel Kettle and tea making now provided without asking Nice breakfast Comfortable bed Very helpful reception staff and concierge
82601,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, It is a shame that there are no parking facilities but hey it is London , The Property was conveniently located for the museums the Albert Hall Kensington Park and was a very manageable stroll to the Chelsea Flower Show The Restaurant was superb The Staff were all very friendly without exception and couldn t have been more helpful and obliging 
82602,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Room was tiny and decor dated no bath and only enough teabags milk and sugar for 2 cups all for 314 plus breakfast extra You are paying for the location , Excellent location close to Royal Parks Royal Albert Hall and Museums good service and great food in the Restaurant
82603,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, This is a very old hotel and have a lot of old carpet and a lot of old furniture all rooms have a very small size old house and need a lot of reparation I received strong allergi and had medicine i could not stay in this hotel because my health condition but hotel manager anyway took all money from me it is absolutely not fair I think a very gready own and manager Terrible experience in my life Be carefull with this hotel , Location
82604,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, They said that although my reservation paid for breakfast it was only the continental This was despite showing them my printed confirmation , The food was good 
82605,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Breakfast staff no side plates for toast had to ask for side plates and toast and then they only brought one side plate out so me and hubby shared and no separate knives so had to use the knives for the cooked breakfast Also had to ask for butter Separate members of staff kept coming up and asking us the same questions so maybe needs a bit of refinement there but it wasn t anything that made the experience awful , Thomaz was excellent as was all the Reception staff but him in particular was very welcoming and showed us to our room and told us the history The cocktail bar was brilliant and the Restaurant we were the only ones in at the time we were dining so we got 5 star treatment The bedroom suite we stayed in was amazing The Elizabeth Room also known as The Tudor Room and came with a great history including the Rolling Stones Fabulous Bed is amazing and was so comfortable 
82606,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Staff are doing their best but with a broken lift small dark room with slightly battered furniture scaffolding outside and a sense that the whole place could do with a refurbishment this simply was not value for money , Friendly staff and comfortable bed 
82607,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, I found small lumps of black plastic rubber in the water after we had already had tea and hot chocolate where we would have drunk some of these without noticing I was upset that this might not be good for us and I was unhappy with the lack of getting back to me about what it was and whether it would be sorted out Also the window didn t close properly and there was scaffolding outside our second floor window with ladders below which meant the view was obscured but also anyone could potentially have climbed up the ladder to just outside our window , Lovely decor inside the hotel and great location 
82608,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The restaurant was expensive and the food mediocre, Fantastic hotel and staff with a big hats off to a chap called AJ who really puts the customer to the front and centre of his day 
82609,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, There was renovation going on we had lots of discomfort The room on 1 st floor It was not possible to open the balcony door due to the scaffolding Also the balcony door was too old and wind was blowing through The room was unbelievably small The second one on 5 th floor had even worse problems as there were construction remains and wood shavings on the carpet in front of their door , The staff was great very friendly helpful and professional The cleaning and linens towels were all great 
82610,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Scaffolding out front that we weren t informed about Room wasn t as pictured much smaller overall and small window Bed was quite small double instead of queen Location was overall good but you have to walk a bit to get to shops and restaurants Didn t take the breakfast because the price was outrageous 23 person level of English at reception wasn t the best , Fairly high standard
82611,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Breakfast was a bit of a disappointment especially as we paid extra for breakfast to be included on booking but in actual fact to have a hot dish we still had to pay extra We did of course thinking that it would be an excellent full English but I have had much better in builder s cafes We were expecting better seeing as the place has a Luxury vibe they need to buy higher quality foods simple , The concierge was tremendous very kind and helpful The room was plush and pretty much everything we wanted Complementary bottle of Prosecco as it was our wedding night too Bar area was very cool too 
82612,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The hotel was undergoing renovations so it was clad in scaffolding However as our stay was over a weekend there was no work going on so it was no problem It was a shame to not be able to take a picture from the outside but we ll be sure to do that next time we come , Right from the moment we walked in the door the staff were amazing attentive polite and gave us the impression that nothing was too much trouble 
82613,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The lift didn t work until the moment we left The room was boiling hot and the temperature controls didn t work We ordered room service and after a very long wait the meal was delivered incorrectly We asked for semi skimmed milk to be delivered to our room and got full fat Not many people seemed to speak or understand English , We were visiting the Albert Hall This hotel is an excellent spot for access to this venue Staff were attentive and everyone tried hard to make our visit comfortable The room was comfortable and full of interesting furniture and fittings 
82614,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Tiny room 110 at the front overlooking street so quite noisy Just enough space to squeeze round the bed Even tinier bathroom Snooty foreign reception staff with a really bad attitude, Perfect location for the Royal Albert Hall just round the corner Nice bar 
82615,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Concierge was particularly helpful Knew all about buses taxis times journeys would take If you like antiques old paintings you will be happy We did not eat in hotel but it looked excellent Small bed room but v comfy 
82616,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The noise The elephant in the room above wasn t very considerate with regards to their heavy feet on the old floorboards at 2am in the morning If you re a light sleeper take earplugs as the doors don t close gently either , Beautiful hotel in a fantastic location was ideal for the purpose of our trip for a concert at the RAH Extremely comfy bed and the staff were friendly and accommodating 
82617,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Nothing Loved it and would stay here again , Very nice comfortable hotel Lovely fixtures and fittings and the staff were excellent too Close to the Royal Albert Hall and about a ten minute walk to the closest tube station We had a four poster bed which needed a ladder to climb on to It was very comfortable though 
82618,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Zip Zilch Nada , The feeling that you re staying in a glamorous Edwardian private residence The generous sized Penhaligons toiletries the sumptuous bathroom pillow selection Also being able to open the window for fresh air a great bonus 
82619,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Staff had good humour and extreamly helpful The breakfast from the presentation to the eating delicious Will defiantly be staying again 
82620,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The room we had this time 102 would not be suitable for people with mobility issues as bed very high and bath hard to get into, Stayed here before lovely hotel with great staff Close to Albert hall
82621,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The third bed really just a camp cot was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on A hotel of this caliber could do better than that Or simply state that a second room was their recommendation , The two Concierge were very helpful and delightful to speak to 
82622,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Me and my partner stayed last night as we were going to the Royal Albert Hall which is a 2 min walk from the hotel to watch Russel Howard Lovely chap on reception when we arrived Showed us to our room Lovely decor all round the hotel which is one of the reasons we booked in the first place Bed was so comfy I m 8 months pregnant so this was fantastic Staff were all polite and friendly We parked at the Horton street car park which was just a 15 20 min walk from the hotel and very reasonable Would definitely recommend this hotel
82623,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, unfriendly staff To the point of being quite rude dreadful breakfast and service in the breakfast room mice in the Bar staff attitude well below what you would expect for this hotel Scaffolding on front of building workmen able to look right into our room not advised of building work or offered another room very poor indeed , Good location for the Royal Albert Hall Beautiful building and decor 
82624,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, breakfast was very poor for what they charge the hotel is about 10 15 minutes walk to the nearest tube not so convenient if you are on the move all time , the decoration was fine and the neighborhood nice and close to the Natural History Museum and the V A museum there are some fine restaurants around 
82625,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, We ordered room service an item which was priced at 8 on the menu We ordered 2 When the food was delivered wonderful service we were charged 22 50 and we have no idea why , The staff were extremely friendly and approachable the room was gorgeous with plenty of tea and coffee The breakfast was amazing beautifully presented foods at the buffet and I had the Canadian pancakes which were just perfect The tea and coffee is also freshly brewed The bed was very comfy and you could ask for different pillows depending on what type of sleep you wanted 
82626,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Tea coffee facilities in room very basic I ve stayed in rooms less than third of price with biscuits basket of fruit offered , Beautifully furnished gorgeous large bath friendly staff esp in restaurant Gore 23 breakfast exceptional choice value Loved the brief visit 
82627,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Away from underground stations , The style of the furniture very large room and bathroom friendly staff quick check in out few steps away from the museums and the Hydepark 
82628,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Shower dripped but not really a problem , the bed extra comfy partner complained about ours when we came home We d love to know where they got their pillows from 
82629,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, I didn t like the fact that I booked this room back in December 2016 and stated clearly that it was for 2 adults and a young child I was told 1 day before we travelled that there were no rooms left with a double and single bed and that a childs cot would not fit in the room We were then told we could stay at their sister hotel but would have to pay a further 100 to have a bed for my child in that room Could this not have been said to us when we made the booking so we could organise something or cancel the reservation Why wait till the day before we travel to tell us Not sure who the fault lies with whether it s the hotel or booking com but it wasn t good enough and we won t be using either again , The hotel was in a nice location and the staff were nice 
82630,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Seats in window just as you walk in bar reserved big table when they arrived could not get through as the large party in the way of doorway perhaps they should have been seated elsewhere not to obstruct the door, Very friendly met at door bags carried for me with such a friendly smile
82631,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Bed was a bit hard uneven Final account per room night was different to the confirmation from booking com I have queried this with the hotel and am awaiting feedback Hot water for shower taps was a bit flaky in Room 504 it eventually got hot but took a while , The location in Kensington is excellent This is a traditional British hotel in decor atmosphere and some quirkiness Great to have Bar 190 next door with the history of The Rolling Stones album launch in1968 Room was a generous size for London the Penhalion toiletries were my favourite and a decent hairdryer Overally a lovely room in a lovely hotel and good value for money 
82632,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The buffet breakfast was very limited but very good quality There was the option of cooked breakfast and other hot meals but you had to pay extra , The staff were very welcoming 
82633,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Tv very small not located in front of bed but rather on the side Service in breakfast room not very attentive Rooms very small No space to put luggage , Friendly staff Gods area Quiet 
82634,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Our room was very small and the bathroom obviously very close to the bedroom hence very little privacy The bathroom did not have any extraction fan so the steam filled the room very quickly to the point of the walls dripping The shower was ornate but literally flooded the bathroom as there was nothing to trap the spraying shower water We had to use the bathrobes on the floor to soak up the water , Beautiful old property location to the Royal Albert Hall was excellent Nice bar 
82635,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Smart and stylish This hotel is a gem beautiful surroundings full of antiques polished floors chandeliers and superb manners from all staff English elegance at its best The room was large the bed was very comfortable and at night with the windows open despite the fact that the room faced onto Queen s Gate there was no noise I hope to return 
82636,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Would have been nice to have a tea and coffee tray in the room only negative , The rooms were incredible couldn t have wished for a better stay Staff were lovely and very helpful 
82637,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, A little too keen to clean the room on the morning of departure although they apologised for intruding too early , Very comfortable bed and room Wonderful service from all the staff
82638,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Perhaps tea and coffee with the kettle in the room would have been nice but this is not a major complaint only a passing thought , The staff were particularly charming and most especially Trevor who made us feel very very much at home We shall definitely visit this hotel next time we come to London 
82639,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, No tea coffee facilities in room little storage and only one small chair for what was supposed to be a double room i e catering for two people, Room ok clean and quiet but very small
82640,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Not a lot Pretty well on the button , Excellent location for the Royal Albert Hall First class staff who were most helpful especially Trevor at the front desk Good room at a fair price 
82641,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The room we were allocated been coming to this hotel for over 2 decades but when I am leaning over the bath to get hot water to wash my hands because it takes so long for hot water to reach tap in basin it s time to quit coming here beyond quirky now tired , The other rooms 
82642,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The only fault I found was although there was three staff on with only four tables to cover at the time they were a bit slow two of them were busy chatting to one another , We loved the stay at the Gore from the second we walked through the door reception staff wear very helpful The room was beautiful as was the bathroom The only fault was the room was a bit to warm for us this is January but that s us The breakfast was well presented and set out in a very beautiful room 
82643,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Above all I liked the bed the pillows and the towels The beautiful residential area of South Kensington is quiet but convenient and the proximity to Hyde Park is one of the hotel s assets

82647,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The rooms are never big enough but it is London , I love the charm of the old building the colors in the rooms the breakfast every morning in the restaurant in the front parlor the bar for a drink or a quick meal all the rooms are very special the Staff was always friendly and helpful and the fact they is a nice small hotel well located 
82648,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Usually stay in a standard room which we love upgraded this time and was extremely disappointed with the superior room as the standard rooms are much better , The beds are the most comfortable ever and the location is great The bar is also lovely just a tad pricey 
82649,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, I had problems with my internet , Lovely helpful staff especially Thomas the concierge Beautiful decor and situated in lovely quiet and safe part of London Good breakfast and lovely library Would stay again 
82650,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, We would have liked to try the breakfast but we did find that this was the only thing that was rather pricey within the hotel , The location of the hotel for the sights we wanted to see was excellent The staff were extremely courteous friendly and helpful For the location and star rating of the hotel we felt the price we got was good value 
82651,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Mobile phones allowed in dinning room sat next to visitor who was talking on her phone all through our breakfast , Customer service Good selection breakfast menu

82654,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The rooms are small but normal for the area and I could hear someone snoring in the next room It s an old building which is charming but I like modern hotels, Perfect location Helpful and friends staff Warm welcome and they brought us tea making facilities on request 
82655,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, published checkin time of 2pm missed by 50 minutes no attempt to apologise or ensure comfort while waiting That matters for an hotel proud to be only 150 yards from Albert Hall but nevertheless leaves us with only minutes to spare for an afternoon event breakfast buffet offering is minimalist compared to other 4 stars staff don t seem committed interested or pro active, Beds v comfy location excellent bar comfortable Cooked breakfast offering is varied and value for money
82656,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The staff seemed a little distracted but very helpful once you got their attention I think it was a very busy weekend for them , The room was lovely and quiet and the communal areas were beautiful especially the central staircase and the library The breakfast was one of the best I ve had in a hotel 
82657,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Music in bar inappropriate for style of hotel Playing modern pop when jazz or classical would be more appropriate We were informed afternoon tea available in library However when requested at 4pm it wasn t available However we were served coffee , Cleanliness Comfort Quietness Good breakfast 
82658,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, However the breakfast is completely over priced We had poached eggs toast x 2 tea a latte for 40 Outrageous , Helpful staff good bar lovely decor great location that s why we keep coming back

82666,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Minor dislike but not a huge deal was the thin walls We were able to hear guests next door leave and arrive But I can understand as this is a period building , I loved everything about this hotel The location is perfect for family with small children You have all the museums on the same block Kensington Grounds is less than 5mins walk You can spend a whole day at Kensington park beautiful walks the children can feed the ducks look around the Kensington Gardens for free and have lunch at the cafe We discovered the Princess Diana memorial park which is just perfect for babies toddlers and children It s not your average park btw There s loads for kids to do So the Gore is a perfect hotel for getting to these places without having to tube The hotel is very clean and decor is beautiful if you like that period type of interior The staff are super friendly and attentive to your needs We stayed on the 4th floor We had our baby and a pram and the lift although small it was good enough for getting us up and down We checked out at 11am but was happy that we were able to have our bags stored downstairs whilst we checked out the natural museum and science museum before heading home Thomas was super kind to let us leave our bags at the hotel storage room Breakfast and dinner here is a must The food taste deliciously amazing Will def be staying here in future 
82667,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the room , Thomas the concierge was most helpful and a real asset to the hotel Although our room was not particularly spacious it was well furnished and worked well for a short stay 
82668,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The cleaning The lift was very old and not working properly but as its an old property the lift i guess is all part and parcel but was not helpful when you have had a knee operation , The location was excellent bed very comfortable

82672,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, There was not a single thing that I didn t like about this hotel It was superb , Everything about this hotel The decor made me think of a past luxurious age gorgeous antique furniture and decorations throughout the hotel We had a really lovely bedroom The staff were very friendly and welcoming The Concierge and Reception staff couldn t do enough for you the Concierge was very helpful and went out of his way to help us The Reception Staff were very informative We hope to be back at this hotel in the near future We were attending a concert at the Albert Hall and the location was superb we were back in the hotel just after the concert in time to have a nightcap drink which just made the evening complete 
82673,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Room was not as bright as we d expected and furnishings were a bit tired There was no mirror for hair drying as dryer couldn t be used in the bathroom and there was only a curved mirror at high level in the room One of the female bar staff members was particularly unpleasant about reserving seats in the bar for post theatre drinkers and even though we had spent all evening dining at the restaurant we were told we couldn t sit in the bar at the end of our meal for our digestives even though we were guests General manager apologised and it was resolved but staff should use more courteous ways of approaching that situation, Restaurant was exceptionally good breakfast both mornings was faultless and the evening meal in Sat night was a really nice dining experience The guy at concierge was very helpful with parking the car and sorting out a portable mirror for the room
82674,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The full English breakfast was a little disappointing Most of the breakfast apart from the eggs was grilled and not fried so the bacon was hard No kettle in the room so couldn t have tea or coffee in the room in the morning , Requests for firmer pillows and Iron and ironing board were dealt with promptly Staff were friendly A stone s throw from the Royal Albert Hall 
82675,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Maybe a kettle in the room to make early morning tea or coffee, The breakfast was very good with a buffet and one could choose one hot dish such as any type of cooked egg with bacon tomatoes mushrooms Service was very good and friendly Good central location with easy access to public transport Room and bed comfortable Good restaurant 
82676,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Rubbish shower in bathroom no wash flannel no tea making facilities in bedroom We were on the 5th floor the lift only goes to 4th the stairs are steep my wife and I were ok with it but others with walking problems would not We were never advised of this possible problem, Location excellent front of house staff

82684,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Not well services by public transport as tube network is not nearby even though location is very central, Staff friendly helpful and providing old world service Hotel is breath of fresh air compared with modern soulless hotels with its old furniture and slightly creaky feel 
82685,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Room awfully small for a deluxe double Plumbing wasn t great and room had an odd odor because of it Breakfast very over priced , Cozy classic ambience in nice quiet neighbhood Had wonderful dinner in on site restaurant and comfortable adjoining bar was a plus

82690,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The first room we were in there was an issue with the shower The water would not get hot We let the desk know on the first day they had maintenance look at it There was no change the second day we said something to the desk and they upgraded us to a different room The only other issue was that the cleaning woman was very gruff and aggressive towards us because we put the Please Service Room sign up but hadn t left yet , The decor was lovely The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful When we had an issue with our room they transferred us to an upgraded room without us even having to ask and at no additional cost Another plus was that they had an American outlet by the desks in the rooms Very convenient We would definitely stay here again 
82691,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Nothing , Very comfy bed Bathroom absolutely spotless Good quality cotton bedding Resident s lounge a pleasure to be in with interesting art Three minute walk from Albert Hall Food excellent also service 
82692,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, There was no marmite In an English hotel The staff not being British nationals hadn t heard of it nor the chef Not good enough The breakfast room staff needed more training we had to ask for things which should have been offered eg sauces more tea empty plates tidied away , The concierge was very helpful and friendly Lovely breakfast 
82693,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Breakfast was a little chaotic coffee cup was dirty Slowish service compared to the bar staff s approach the night before , Great room lovely setting bar staff service perfect
82694,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, In my parents room no one switched on the air on for them and being reticent they didn t know how to or who to ask they therefore boiled opened the window for air and suffered London noise , Staff v friendly but access to room a bit difficult as lift didn t reach 5th floor 
82695,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, No tea coffee making facilities in the room The insulation between our room and next door was not good unless our neighbours were particularly noisy , Position character charming staff attractive traditional dining room good size bedroom 
82696,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Initial booking was wrong Didn t seem to know how many people were staying and was offered an alternative hotel at 11pm Train tickets were thrown away by mistake by maid but no help offered when tickets couldn t be replaced , Room decor was done in good taste 
82697,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Please see above, Staff very friendly and helpful Magdalena Trevor Thomas and Francesca All went out of the way to serve Towels and linens very clean and the room was made up nicely everyday But the bed was too soft and the furnishings were too ancient 
82698,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Picked this hotel because of the location and it was excellent with lots of local shops and places to eat nearby in the roads away from the main road The staff were very helpful and went out of their way to ensure that we had any information we needed and advise about local amenities The hotel is decorated in a traditional style suitable to the period which is very well done I can see that other reviews have interpreted this d cor as tired but although perhaps there is some wear on the carpets in some places the hotel is very clean and the overall look is well created It s probably best not to stay here if you like white bright minimalist style The bedroom was a little small but adequate and the bed was very comfortable and we had a view of the Royal Albert Hall so very pleasant I would definitely stay here again 
82699,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Room luxurious in the old Rococco style Wonderful bid comfortable bed Very welcoming helpful staff incredible location opp Hyde Park Home away frm home 
82700,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, It was a bit pricey but that is just London And they were doing some construction during our stay but it was quiet at night , It was one block from our meeting at Imperial Innovations so that was great Would also be perfect for Royal Albert Hall and many other things The concierge was wonderful Great staff all around I d go back 
82701,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The Wi Fi was a little suspect even if you were prepared to pay for additional band width but this is a minor reservation , It was amazingly quiet which was what I had asked for The location was ideal for the major museums and the Albert Hall and even the newest taxi drivers know 190 Queens Gate
82702,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Access wasn t ideal for a pram and I imagine a nightmare for a wheelchair but given the age of the building this is totally understandable Carpets in the room very tired but I have paid more in London for hotels that haven t come close to the Gore , Location staff were very professional and friendly and the hotel has a superb unique character Ideal location for the park and museums which are all within walking distance even with young children 
82703,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, A couple of bizarre things given the cost ot the room 1 There was no tea and coffee provided in the room When we asked it seemed like they just didn t want to provide any You get tea and coffee in a Travelodge room so can t understand why they don t do it many other reviews said the same thing as I found out later 2 It took us a day to get an extra bed side lamp in our room Again very bizzare 3 The room was very nice but the carpet looked quite stained again odd for such an otherwise up market hotel , Location was excellent plus we got an upgraded room Service was good and the bed was very comfortable Air con was a bonus too 
82704,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, I would like tea and coffee in the room because I don t like asking for room service when I m rushing to get ready, The staff truly make this place A warm welcome and nothing is too much trouble Easy check in and out

82709,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The lack of tea coffee in the bedrooms and the fact that 10 of the first 12 tv channels were adult content Not good at all , The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was excellent including tea in the lounge and to our room at no cost Excellent concierge Lovely quiet setting 
82710,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The receptionist said when we arrived that we had been upgraded because of our request for a room with a walk in shower but the room didn t have this so we ended up paying quite a lot extra for a junior suite to get what we wanted The staff seemed a bit confused about which rooms of which grade had which facilities , The extremely comfortable bed with beautiful high quality linen The calm and civilised atmosphere 
82711,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The doorman porter concierge was just a little too jolly for my liking but others may prefer that At least he was happy and friendly No de caff tea of coffee available in the bar , Fabulously comfortable beds in twin room Room acceptable size considering location 
82712,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Nothing really but if I was being picky the bar is very expensive but it is central London , This is a charming hotel beautifully decorated and in an amazing location The staff were all very accommodating and pleasant the doormen were especially friendly and helpful and that just always helps to make your day go well I had a classic double room and it was restful and peaceful despite facing the road the traffic is really not a problem I had a wonderful weekend here 
82713,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, 1 Classic double room is very tiny suitcases need to be stored under the bed otherwise no room to walk need to move rubbish bin to fully open the door to the small cupboard only drawers available are the drawers in the desk 2 internet very slow or absent , Position Friendly helpful staff Comfortable bed 
82714,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, I thought the decor was a bit dark but that is my personal taste , everyone was very helpful very comfortable and although I did not have the breakfast I think 23 is quite expensive especially if you dont have cooked breakfast Very comfortable bed and windows you can open 
82715,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Room 501 on the top floor was great cosy but beautifully decorated with a four poster bed Only problem was space in the bathroom was so tight you couldn t sit squarely on the loo , Excellent location in Kensington 2 mins from Hyde Park and The Royal Albert Hall perfect concert accommodation Classy feel Great bar Wonderful staff 
82716,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, See above, Second time we ve stayed and this time room not so good looked a bit tired Staff at bar and reception were excellent especially Trevor Staff at breakfast very pleasant but we had to ask for things which should have been offered eg sauces and also had to ask for them twice However it is a very comfortable relaxing place to stay in a first class location and we ll definitely be back

82735,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Like many people who live in Europe I am always rather disappointed by the fact that buffet breakfast is not included in the price in Europe particularly Austria it is always included London is very expensive especially for those who live in Euros , The buffet breakfast was fine and the dining room and bar area very pleasant Also the staff were very helpful efficient and friendly 
82736,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Lack of drawer space in the bedroom For one night it did not matter but for a longer stay would not want to keep non hangables in my suitcase , Easy walking distance to the Royal Albert Hall Polite courteous staff

82741,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Hotels in Lobdon are expensive this is a given The immediate feel is one of some luxury and certainly the web site confirms this impression At reception we were told our room was upgraded Excellent We were then led all the way up to a smallish double room in the attic clean and comfortable but without tea nor coffee making facilities We were underwhelmied to say the least 
82742,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Creaky bed Small room Prices just on the wrong side of good value even though I paid close to the bottom price of 200 I didn t feel ripped off Though 5 for a coffee really Double charged for breakfast probably a mistake but it s better when you don t have to point it out If they were 30 40 cheaper they would be my first choice go to hotel in London However at 200 night there are lots to choose from If I had one suggestion it would be to get some decent leather chesterfield type chairs and tables in the guest lounge I ve never seen anyone in it and I think it s because the furniture may be period but it s uncomfortable and badly arranged , Good toast in the morning Good shower Friendly Staff unusual in London Fantastic Bar area Location superb for out of town visitors 
82743,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, A pity tea coffee making facilities are not provided Lighting in bathroom mirror terrible and a shaving mirror would have been nice Has anyone ever tried putting on make up in there , Friendly staff and great location for Royal Albert Hall

82745,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, lack of an Irish single malt in the bar, Coming back to The Gore after more than 25 years we were naturally apprehensive BUT nothing to fear Staff were all welcoming helpful cheerful Bedroom was excellent with a bed you wanted to take home Breakfast was absolutely superb with every anything you might need though we enjoyed the confusion created by another guest s demand for brown sauce Eggs Florentine matched any previous menu with smoked salmon on the side And again the serving staff were on the ball The location away from the maelstrom of City West End couldn t be better so stay here with confidence We loved The Gore and each other even more on this magical re visit 
82746,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Bed was rock hard we hardly slept Duty Manager did not react to our comments as sympathetically as we would have hoped Service in bar poor and the hot chocolate was tepid when it arrived I know this is a first class hotel but a kettle in the room would have been appreciated , Very pretty hotel in excellent location Staff generally very charming and friendly

82751,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Noisy room in terms of road noise and people walking up staircase No facilities to make tea in room , Location for Albert hall Hotel has lots of character Bar nice atmosphere 
82752,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, There was a little confusion over the breakfast charge one item included which was not ordered and total bill seemed higher than correct as I understood that continental was included when booking was made I paid for item 15 but total seemed very high even after deleting the coffee which was not ordered , Comfortable base for our visit to the R A H practically next door 
82753,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Wish breakfast had been included , Great location so close to everything Right next to the Kensington Gardens which are stunning and so convenient to walk anywhere through the beautiful gardens Staff were so warm friendly helpful and accommodating Felt welcomed and right at home The hotel itself is STUNNING A true English style so many stairs and every floor is stunning The rooms have beautiful comfortable beds running drapery wallpaper paintings I loved it so much So happy to have stayed here on my trip Pub was comfy welcoming and made some nice friends

82763,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Location was too far from Knightsbridge It takes 20 minutes to walk there and over 20 minutes if you have shopping The Russian waitresses were not friendly and the receptionists spoke little to no English They not only made a mistake on my breakfast order because they couldn t understand English they were also very rude to Asian people The toilet on the ground floor stank worse than a public toilet It smelt like urine had been on the floor for days The hotel room cleaner was stingy on soap and toiletries They did not give us shampoo soap or sanitary bags for the three days we stayed there , The single redeeming factor was a portly bearded English doorman who was amusing cheerful friendly and helpful with our luggage We wished that we had met him on the first day upon arrival and not the last day when we were leaving

82782,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, plenty of character and history with a warm welcome as you walked in and the high standard did not drop through out our stay The upgraded room was an added bonus Would definitely stay again 
82783,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The hotel lacked that extra touch which was a shame as everything else was wonderful The lift very old was an experience however these points would not stop me from returning to this hotel , A beautifully quaint hotel with unique well equipped rooms designed for comfort Spacious the bathroom was lovely double bath Staff at breakfast were very polite friendly the selection was very good I was on the fourth floor it was wonderfully quiet

82789,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, I couldn t get the wifi working and although the deal included free wifi I hadn t understood that it would be necessary to pay extra to have hi speed wifi Didn t have time to discuss this with the hotel so might have been a one off , The character and charm of the building very comfortable room and pleasant and helpful staff And a wonderful staircase Good breakfast too 
82790,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The restaurant looked very clinical and not inviting There were complaints next morning regarding service for breakfast so we ate out but we didn t experience it for ourselves , The staff were friendly helpful The rooms were very clean nicely decorated The bar was very comfortable efficient 
82791,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Breakfast wasn t very well organised Took us 20 mins to get a cup of tea and over 40 mins for the main part of my breakfast Staff seemed uninterested in the restaurant where it was served, We had a beautiful room up on the 5th floor Very clean comfy and just what we were looking for Congierge staff who showed us to our room were very friendly and welcoming
82792,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Small bathroom, The bathroom was on the small side but the location of the hotel we were attending a concert at the Royal Albert Hall was excellent and the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff more than made up for this 
82793,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, undergoing refurbishment no tea coffer in room room very small no ramp at entrance for wheeled suitcases no coffee available in lounge next morning early checkout at 11 00am, staff very good location wonderful 
82794,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Room much smaller than advertised lift capacity is very limited Simply not a 5 institution , Location is excellent for Royal Albert Hall Hyde Park and Museums General ambience and staff both very good 
82795,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Can t think of any negatives , Staff were very professional warm and welcoming and eager to share their local knowledge to make our stay a success Hotel bar was a real surprise obviously a real hit with locals as well as hotel guests this place has a great vibe as well as being warm and stylish
82796,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, No tea making facilities in the toom Room service expensive for a cup of tea Traffic noise a bit of a problem , Excellent location for Royal Albert Hall V A Natural History Museam Kensington Palace and Hyde Park Harrods within walking distance Staff excellent
82797,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Tiny tiny room but ok for 145 , Genuinely pleasant and helpful staff on front desk Housekeeping is excellent bathroom was dazzling bed linen beautifully made up 
82798,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, 1 Asked receptionist on our arrival for place to get food at 2 30pm told to go 10 minutes walk up the road Found out on our return the hotel bar does food 2 Room was cold with draught 3 Room service breakfast was not cooked as requested asked for well done eggs they were still runny and uncooked inside full of slime 3 Not informed last orders at the bar and website says bar open until 1am Asked for a drink at 12 30am and told bar closed We had been in the bar in a separate room we were shown to as the bar was busy on our evening arrival after the Royal Variety performance , Location to Albert Hall
82799,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, There was no mixer in the bathroom the windows were old and a draft of cold air was coming through which was still bearable but then the noise com the street especially during the nigh and very early morning was particularly loud and intolerable The rug kilim was particularly dirty The hallways were very narrow and the air was heavy The staff though very polite was not sincerely helpful ,No Positive
82800,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, A little dissapointed as there was no tea coffee making facilities in the room and wouldve liked a king size bed considering the price of the room Think there are cheaper hotels with better service, beautiful hotel friendly staff and excellent location
82801,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The club sandwich was a bit poor , The room was lovely We were at the front of the building and the sun was shining through the french windows and being October the leaves had changed colour It was lovely 
82802,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, No dislikes but perhaps a standard check out time of 11 30am rather than 11am especially on a Sunday , very comfortable room excellent breakfast friendly and helpful staff the hotel is also close to the Albert Hall so is an ideal location for attending concerts events etc
82803,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Not enough staff in the bar after performance many people had long waits I am sure the hotel lost money too we ensured we paid but it would have been easy not to have done I also think 12 5 service on an already expensive bottle of bubbly is a little cheeky especially when service slow The same applied to our tea coffee after performance when service was shocking staff were lovely just not enough of them , Brilliant location and good facilities Food was good and staff were friendly Would stay again
82804,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Nothing of note, From the minute we arrived until the moment we left the staff could not have been more friendly or more helpful We were given a bottle of Prosecco for our anniversary thank you Our welcome to the hotel and bar was excellent Location
82805,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, General ambiance wonderful art work and antique pieces The whole was very well put together The dining room however is ready for a re furb it does not match the standard of the remainder of The Gore 
82806,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Very pricey for the quality of the hotel compared to others of better quality for less money It has old character but is in need of some rejuvenation Stale bread at breakfast ,No Positive
82807,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, our room was spacious and clean but unfortunately could do with some double glazing as could hear the traffic all night Only had breakfast in the hotel one day as we had to wait at least 45 mins and when it came it wasn t very warm , the location is excellent for the royal albert hall only a 10 min walk to the nearest tube station the staff were friendly and helpful 
82808,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Although we could order tea to have had it provided available in the room would be nice , From the moment we entered the hotel until our departure we were made to feel warmly welcome and at home All the staff went the extra mile including one who cheerfully early morning carried our luggage a long way to our parked car Trevor whose personality and engaging hospitality are outstanding 
82809,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, had absolute murders with this hotel as we had booked this for mum for her birthday and a day before she was to stay they wanted to see photo i d and the credit card that the booking was paid with by the way we actually paid it all 6 months before the stay and said unless we produced it mum would not be allowed to stay so we actually had to pay them again only for them to refund back the payment to us after the stay does this make any sense NO it doesn t will not be staying here again by the way don t expect tea or coffee in room they don t do it only if you want to pay a kings ransome for room service , nice hotel near royal albert hall
82810,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The lack of respect shown to the ladies in reception by other members of staff The lack of tea coffee facilities , Reception ladies were extremely helpful and friendly 
82811,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, This hotel really is just 5 minutes walk from the Royal Albert Hall We were greeted by name when our taxi drew up outside and a member of staff came outside to unload our cases All the staff were so friendly and we felt we were really welcome The hotel really does cater for individual requirements not at all like the large chain hotels 
82812,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Very bad service in the restaurant Resulting in me getting a bad pain in my back Bench seat so uncomfortable First in the restaurant and had to wait 1 15 mins for main meal Everybody else had been served and had eaten there meals before we got ours Very upset , Was close to the royal albert hall
82813,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The wash hand basin in our bathroom had a great big crack Nothing was done even when I mentioned it to reception The bedroom and bathroom were very small had to squeeze around the bottom of the bed to get into it and hardly any room in the bathroom to sit on the toilet squashed in between the toilet roll holder and the wash had basin if you were a large person it would have been a problem Overall for the amount of money it cost to stay for two nights I was very disappointed and would never stay there again nor recommend it to anyone , The staff were very helpful Good location 
82814,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Little surprised there was no kettle or complimentary tea coffee in the room We had the superior suite and whilst a lovely room the mattress was a little soft , Beautiful hotel and really friendly staff
82815,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, I thought the price of the full english breakfast was a bit steep in relation to what you were served, Location to Albert Hall was great Staff were very friendly and helpful
82816,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, As a resident being told the tables in the bar were all reserved and being asked to perch on a bar stool after a day walking the sights Breakfast the poached eggs on 2 occasions were over cooked and took 25 minutes to arrive On arrival lot of staff around front desk some of which were excellent but some clearly having a stressed discussion argument in language Not in front of the clients , Location near theatre and museums excellent Beautiful Interiors decor furnishings have great character and charm albeit just looking a touch jaded in one or two places 
82817,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Felt for the quality of the hotel the bed was not comfortable Both the bed and the half bed moved in for the 3rd person were uncomfortable Wish there was an option at breakfast in the restaurant for a smaller choice croissant toast cereal etc and not just the buffet or main course Felt the buffet was not worth the price Don t mind paying for something that is worth it , Loved the location Staff was excellent and so personal Loved the character of the hotel Extremely clean and elegant Products in the bathroom the best Linens were scrumptious We were thrilled with the experience 
82818,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The noise from the air conditioning vent in my room was so bad I was unable to sleep until 5am It sounded like a car revving and when I complained twice in the middle of the night I was told that there was nothing they could do as it was the kitchen fans They did reduce my bill by half but the stress put a damper on the whole trip The restaurant is also overpriced with limited choice and the 12 5 service charge is outrageous , The decor was beautiful the bar atmospheric and the location excellent 
82819,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Prices in the bar , Friendly staff who we re very helpful Liked the history of the hotel it s character Locality was really good with a super walk into the city Supper location for Albert Hall too

82822,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, No tea coffee making facilities in the room is a disappointment considering we spent 93 each for a bed overnight without breakfast , I wanted a hotel within easy walking distance of the Royal Albert Hall and The Gore certainly was it was literally just round the corner It s in a nice location between Hyde Park and the museum area for the Victoria Albert and the Natural History Museum etc and you certainly feel safe on the streets in the area Lots of restaurant cafe choices within a stones throw on Gloucester Road too I love the individuality of the hotel it s not at all like a chain hotel and the staff were really friendly and welcoming allowing us to book in early and letting us leave our bag there after we booked out and always with a friendly smile We paid 186 for a standard double room without breakfast through Booking com I expect to pay that for a nice area of London and I have no complaint about that except for that price I really would expect to be able to make myself a coffee tea in my room The room itself was very pleasant with a nice view across Queen s Gate The bed and linen were really comfortable so full marks for that and the bathroom was excellent I cannot comment on the food as we ate out in the evening and found a great mews pub just round the corner for a delicious Sunday lunch All in all did I enjoy my stay there Yes I did Would I go back again Certainly especially if I was going to the Albert Hall 
82823,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Extremely poor TV reception and number of channels 7 Appalling for an expensive central hotel Toilet did not flush properly Designer hotel a triumph of appearance over substance ,No Positive
82824,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The staff were friendly but didn t try to do that extra which you d expect from the price range We had to call for more toiletries even toilet paper 2 times as the cleaners didn t leave or notice that we needed new refill It felt like the staff were lazy because we were two young friends staying in a room I wasn t really impressed by this hotel I was very excited to stay there but I wouldn t recommend it to friends , Boutique not too many people small and friendly staff 
82825,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Everything The staff were proffessional friendly knowledgeable about London and nothing was too much trouble We were lucky to stay in the Dame Melba room which was a unique experience especially the bathroom I cannot recommend this hotel too much We decided to make this our regular London hotel from now on The Restaurant and Bar were excellent too Location was great we got taxis straight away 
82826,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The pillows were a little too accommodating and went very flat during the night There were no prices for the mini bar so we were reluctant to have anything , Very friendly staff who made us feel extremely welcome The hotel is grand and was in a great location and within walking distance to local attractions Nat History Museum Royal Albert Hall Notting Hill 
82827,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The foot of the bed was too close to the wall less than 25 cm so banged my legs on the footboard there were no tea making facilities service at dinner was poor the bar closed early but were then charged a 5 service fee for service in the lounge the hot item I chose for breakfast was disappointing Not worth the money , Excellent location beautifully clean opulent decor tasty dinner

82833,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Need to upgrade vegetarian breakfast or adjust price accordingly , Staff really helpful couldn t do enough for us Good location Lovely hotel with quite unique features 
82834,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The addition of service charges for eating breakfast that you have already paid for and for ordering room service should be stopped as the hotel is already quite pricey After spending about 2 500 for a weekend stay with a group celebrating a special event I was rather disappointed that they would not accommodate the request of a complimentary bottle of bubbly , The style of the hotel and the staff The concierge was very helpful 
82835,The Gore Hotel Starhotels Collezione, The room was only ok Some nice touches but some downers like very audibly hearing the flush from the room above Breakfast room service was ok but not great , General area of the hotel are excellent
