501194,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, I booked a suites room and a double room we asked to be connected because we have 3 children of which one disabled Of course we did not have rooms connected or the possibility to changing them At the reception they blamed the booking although I asked them in writing Because I could not leave children alone I slept with the children in the suite and the husband alone The couch is terrible It s impossible to sleep on it You can not ask for a lot of money on a suite and offer a very incomfortable sleeping couch By far the biggest Disappointment was the Breakfast which even though it was free was not good for hotel claims and the parking There was no parking for the wheelchair and in the garage the car did not fit because the maximum was 2 m At a hotel with such claims and prices I expect something else ,No Positive
501195,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior,No Negative, Great location for VIC meetings Amazing value for money Cheerful friendly staff Rooms and facilities are well designed and everything works perfectly 
501196,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Getting the room only at 2pm is inconvenient for those that get in early in the morning Breakfast is too expensive , Perfect place to stay for business at VIC Hotel is cheerful efficient reliable and terrific value for money 
501197,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Pillows are too soft and don t provide proper support Didn t offer soap bars it was all liquid attached to the walls , Afternoon treats mini souffle and coffee machine quality Buffet breakfast Staff was professional 
501198,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior,No Negative, The location is ideal for meetings at UN Then there is the bus directly to the Airport The hotel has all you need great breakfast also outside friendly and fast staff fast internet and seemingly a predominance of alpha male guests 
501199,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, The tv and the channels are so poor selected the hotel is in front of UN so more international channel should be available but the fact was only 3 channels in English which were for news no English Channels for movies or documentary also there was one bottle of water complementary the rest of days u have to pay , Rooms are clean
501200,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, That there was no a la carte option for breakfast in the restaurant, Staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble location was also excellent easy access to the U train system overall perfect My family and I will no doubt stay here again if we visit Vienna
501201,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, I could not remember of anything that would really bother me Maybe only I had a feeling that staff at the reception desk is not interested in their work and consequently lack of hospitality was in the air , In particular location since I ve had meetings at Tech Gate Vienna accesability Bus transfer from Vienna Airport stops infront of hotel clean room 
501202,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Reception not helpful Awfully expensive for what they offer, Space in the room Excellent complimentary coffee when I did not have to ask where it is
501203,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior,No Negative, placement is perfect easy to get by car 5 stops by subway and you are on Stefan Platz 2 stops in opposite direction and you are at Donnau Zentrum large shopping mall 
501204,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Expensive parking , Clean room comfortable beds Very easy to find the hotel Nice breakfast Very friendly staff Metro is two minutes from hotel and it is very easy to get to the city center very quickly Close to Danube 
501205,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, 1 No wardrobe in a suite 2 Nowhere to hang clothes at night 3 Pillows were so soft as to be useless even six were not enough 4 Always having to log into the internet even with a four day stay 5 Having to ask for the in room breakfast menu and one morning they forgot to pick it up 6 Lack of staff at the reception desk queues of five or even ten minutes the norm 7 The doorstop conveniently placed to ensure excruciating toe stub almost every time we used the hooks that passed for the wardrobe 8 Single duvets for a double bed 9 No security at the entrance to the hotel anyone could walk in off the street with or without a reservation 10 Even worse the so called executive floor could be accessed by anyone entering the lift 11 Our fault for not checking but anyone expecting enticing streets and cafes in the vicinity of this hotel will disappointed the surrounding architecture is mostly concrete blocks almost neo Stalinist in design with the building itself fronting busy dual carriageways on two sides and a railway line nearby , Bathrooms in our suite were good Abundant breakfast one enough for two
501206,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior,No Negative, I stayed only 1 night and didn t have breakfast or test any of the facilities other than the room but the location is very practical and the hotel was great value for the money The minibar was included in the room category rate which was a nice extra 
501207,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, We got charged for a drink from the mini bar after explicitly stating that nothing has been used from it and really nothing was used Parking in the hotel was paid 22 euros PER DAY This is simply unacceptable for a guest in your own hotel since normal parking is around 10 13 euros in the neighborhood No slippers in the room no big towels The safe in the room jammed and we couldn t get out the stuff we needed until the morning after Dinner was extremely overpriced , The staff was helpful though misleading at times 
501208,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, The computer in the business center in German language and I needed modified my power point presentation but the program was blocked I expected to have the famous Vienna coffee in the breakfast but we had every morning terrible cold coffee they clean the drinking glasses with chemicals detergent and not to wash with water the steam and sauna room mixed they need only to make different timing for male and female and time for both so can make every body happy, Clean and tidy breakfast with different varieties Excellent location helpful staff
501209,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Pricey for what it is No toothbrush or razor in room Have to ask and collect by urself at from reception No iron in room but there s a communal one on floor A bit of hassle , Great location for Austria centre Airport bus drops u right outside hotel Nice breakfast and good room service options 
501210,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, One Sauna wasn t working and also the Wii room was out of order , I had a reservation for executive room executive lounge room access The friendly stuff did upgrade me for free to superior room and let me check in 4 hours in advance without any extra fees 
501211,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, the breakfast was not managed well A personal has a problem with cleaning tables Not enough chairs But later they solved , close to U bahn Parking in Garage 
501212,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, When I arrived at my next destination I realized that some items had been removed from my suitcase while I was away from the hotel dispite the fact that I had the do nodt disturb sign on my door for the dudration of my 4 day stay I thought that perhaps I hadn t packed them however when I arrived home I realized that indeed the items that were brand new still in their packaging went missing Unfortunately I have learned that all items need to be locked up whenever I leave the room , Almost everything 
501213,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, For a long stay i had to ask for new login user name and password for WIFI every 3 days No iron and ironing board in the room , Convenience of location Friendly and helpful staff 
501214,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Breakfast was terrible and the room was warn out , Location was great for ACV and VIC and good for getting to the town center The area itself was very boring 
501215,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, It was a bit further out from the center Not too bad about a 15 taxi , Very nice hotel bar and the beds were clean The shower was great and had very strong pressure 
501216,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, The wifi was down for a day and i kept getting logged out the other days but when it worked it worked good The login page for the wifi was also kind of confusing but the staff helped , The bed was really comfy and my room was clean and big It s not in the city centre but there is a subway close by that takes you there in like 10 min The breakfast was good and the staff was very helpful and friendly I was there for a conference in the Vienna Centre and for that it was an excellent location just a 5 minute walk There was a huge shopping center just 2 stops away with the subway so you dont have to go far to get stuff 
501217,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Wifi was not working on my phone which meant I did not have access to communication for 3 days Calling from the hotel was exorbitant and I chose not to use the facility , Staff were friendly from reception restuarant to housekeeping 
501218,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, I expected to be able to use the Wellness and Sport facilities however during to an even they closed it exactly during the whole length of my stay with no notice I saw it suddenly in the elevator written in small and between some other advertisement regarding the event which I was not interested so I really saw the notice by chance I think they should have given some discount as the facilities were not available and people could have then chosen another place to stay , I was there for a conference at the Austria Center so it was really good location for me Also 3 minutes from the U bahn so wherever you d like to go it s easy Breakfast was also good as well as the room and bathroom were clean The hotel is going towards sustainable behaviors so that was also good 
501219,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Duvet was too thin One very small and one small normal towel is not what one expects in a four star hotel Rooms could do with an overhaul more plugs etc , Staff was quick to bring slippers extra duvet duvet was very thin and extra towels Bottles of water very nice their taxi driver was prompt to take us around and they aloud late check in Food from room service was excellent although very pricey 
501220,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Entrance to the executive lounge I arrived around 8h50 and styed in room 427 I had no permission to the lounge with my room cart , Ontvangst en het uitgebreide buffet
501221,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Welcome by staff at the reception a bit unfriendly Strange position of the bed in the middle of the room night stand behind the bed toilet separate from the bathroom no sink to was hands in the toilet room had to go from one side of the room to the other to wash hands Water bottle on the table costing 5 60 euro but the price tag was towards the wall not visible at first Many hotels offer a bottle of water for free with the message with compliments I assumed it was the same and saw the price after I opened it that was an unpleasant surprise wifi not reliable disconnecting and having to login again all the time location was not perfect but it was the closest I could find for the place where I had the event I was attending to I regret not having chosen a hotel in the center and just taking a taxi for getting to the event place there is nothing to see around it feeling cold in the room in spite of putting the air conditioning to a warmer temperature, Warming Infrared light in the bathroom very close to a metro line
501222,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Everything good , Good location The metro station just in front of Few stops till city center Good breakfast The room is very clean The parking is inside the building 
501223,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Wi fi is TERRIBLE and it needs to be fixed quickly before some mad guest does something horrible The area by the hotel is quite empty no grocery store no restaurant only a little pastry shop by the metro station but it s a minor detail , We travelled with 2 kids and booked a family room which was perfect for our needs We liked breakfast a lot and access to the executive lounge with free snacks and beverages very convinient with kids There is a nice playground and a great park with a lake by the hotel Donauinsel Vienna s island with several playgrounds is just one metro station away from the hotel 
501224,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Advanced payment problems ineptitude with bank card processing I had to ask bank to relax security for this transaction Wired deposit 50 Euro day for already prepaid stay Inadequate information about what is included in the price, Location near metro Spacious clean room Cosy beds Good value for money with promo
501225,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, The breakfast dishes need to be improved because there wasn t variaty Every day was the same and that was a little bit frustrating because the kids complained about it , Great place We stayed for 3 nights here and we loved it We booked the suite at the executive floor and it was very nice 2 large rooms mini bar and very clean 
501226,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, air condition was not really cooling and some of the reception staff were not friendly and to some extend were a bit rude , size of family room was great
501227,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Breakfast was quite poor staying there for 7 nights and having the same breakfast every day was not the most pleasant thing , Everything was just great 
501228,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, lady on a reception desk she was not polite , almost everything special thanks to Mr Senad from reception extremely helpful and polite young man 
501229,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior,No Negative, Very helpful staff Comfortable clean room across from the metro but it appears some stairs need to be accessed if you are arriving from the metro Quiet area near parks and lake
501230,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Although we had prepaid the full amount to the hotel as soon as we got there we were asked to deposit another eur 50 day for the extras we found this amount to be outrageous considering the cost of the hotel was eur 85 day Also even though our bed sheets were changed the staff forgot to change our pillow cases through out our stay Furthermore we asked the hotel to bring us double bed coverings but they told us that it was not possible In addition the hotel needs to upgrade it s computers as we had a really hard time getting them to work , We liked the location of the hotel as there was direct transfer to the downtown area The staff was also friendly 
501231,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, we were offered an upgrade to an executive room together with access to mini bar waste of money no upgrade it would have been cheaper to pay for mini bar us age, we were going on a river cruise the location was perfect love prater which is also very close 
501232,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Breakfast was too expensive, Good location not too far from city center but at the same time not too central Large comfortable room Good breakfast options 
501233,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, The view was not amazing from top floor The view was more of the rooms in front of us The shower in the double room was open so make sure the second person is your partner , The rooms were spacious and all in all it was a nice hotel
501234,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, I checked out on Sunday and needed a bit help with luggage But reception desk told me that they can provide the cart but I have to do it myself as on Sunday there s no bell desk service , The upgrade to executive apartment for 20 euros a night was really a good deal Huge room and free mini bar consumption Definitely recommend it if you are traveling with family 
501235,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, the staff was not friendly at the reception they did not bother to give the correct invoice with the right information on it even if i asked twice i received twice a wrong document due to carelessness the hotel did not have large blankets only small single ones i was not informed for the sauna and other facilities available free of charge during the check in, the location was close to the VIC where the business meetings were held the hotel was next to the metro station and next to a bus station with direct connection to the airport
501236,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior,No Negative, I was doing business at the UN center and this hotel is right across the street from it Also across the street is a subway station and a pharmacy Down the street is a neighborhood grocery store Nothing much else in this neighborhood but for UN business the location is excellent 
501237,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, The quantity of food at the breakfast buffet was amazing There were 3 different types of eggs which was amazing However they tasted horrendous Instead of serving the cheapest eggs prepared in 3 different forms the quality should be tested especially in a 4 star quality Quality over quantity please , The bed was comfortable Facilities great Staff polite and helpful Underground across the street Breakfast buffet huge something for everyone 
501238,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior,No Negative, Staff at desk bar and restaurant were very nice and friendly Hotel d cor is a little outdated but does not look shabby or worn Even though located outside of old town a subway stop is conveniently located across the street along with an airport bus stop No complaints about the room Clean and quiet 
501239,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, I upgraded to an executive suite which was a bit small This allowed free use of the mini bar which had a very small selection This was never fully restocked even though I requested it be replenished daily Turn down service only occurred twice in 5 nights Hotel was fine otherwise but the service was poor , Excellent location 
501240,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, modest minibar we need more that 1 one coca cola , Nice apartament coffee and Nespresso 2 tv sets with enough english posts very clean spacious bathroom Subway just in front of hotel 3 station to Prater 6 to Stephansplatz Station for airport bus in front of hotel 
501241,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Parking price , Good location 10 minutes by subway from downtown Vienna It has a parking but can be a bit costly with 21 euros day Clean rooms breakfast was very good 
501242,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Only negative things is that it say that there is a fitness but the fitness was actually just 2 runways and 1 bicycle But there is 3 different sounas which compensate everything , This hotel is absolutelly great Not expensive at all for the quality they provide The staff is super super nice and helpful excluding 1 always grumpy girl on reception and the cleanliness is superb The rooms are big and very comfortable Bed as well really comfortable Location is perfect the airport bus stops exactly in front of the enters of the hotel and a cross the street is the subway which leads you exactly to the main street iin the center We were extreamly happy with our stay in this hotel Highly recommend it 
501243,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, At our arrival 8 PM the room was set up as a single and the receptionist said that in a few minutes someone will bring the missing stuff After 4 hours we need to call again the reception because nothing was done ,No Positive
501244,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, I booked a double room and requested a quiet room but the first room that we were given was a twin room So we asked for a room change and were given a double room however this room was a quite noisy as it was in front of the elevators and also because there was a group of guests nearby who were noisy So we again asked for a room change and finally settled into a quiet double room The staff members were very nice but it d have been better if my requests were actually met from the beginning Nonetheless I would highly recommend this hotel , The location is great for not only for some who has something to do with the UN but also for regular travellers because the hotel is right next to the bus stop where airport bus arrives and is also across the road from U1 subway line The main tourist attractions e g Stephansplatz Karlsplatz etc are only 10 15 minutes by subway Breakfast was also really good 
501245,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior,No Negative, First of all gorgeous breakfast very broad choice furthermore good location to subway just across the street very comfortable a stylish environment 100 to recommend not only for younger also for older and demanding couple

501247,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Internet worked badly kept loosing connection and had to re log in every 5 min it was annoying Brekfast for 22 is a rip off Insane I took breakfast at VIC for 5 Pillows are a bit too flat and not firm enough Room was a bit cold AC worked but didnt seem to make a difference , Location across the Street from VIC where I had my 3 day meeting Clean modern beautiful design large bathroom with the view on the river Free tea coffee in the room
501248,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior,No Negative, Location is somewhere in the middle of the city so it was quite convenient to get to both ends for business outside of the city and leisure down town A direct shuttle bus from the airport right to the hotel door was definitely a big advantage A pleasant surprise were apples left in the room on daily basis Breakfast was very good with big variety of choices in a cosy environment of the restaurant Escalator was always available though there were many guests 
501249,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior,No Negative, The breakfast was amazing Facilities is really nice sauna gym rooms for Wii games and a chance to go on a rooftop almost to enjoy the view Recommend for travelers with a car

501251,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior,No Negative, Location is great for someone who has business with the Vienna International Center which is just across the road And the upgrade to a status which allows to use the executive lounge is just worth the money 
501252,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, WiFi requires log in too many times in a day Not convenient, 15 Euro upgrade to receive access to the executive lounge and no extra charge to consume any all items in the mini bar Close proximity to metro station and to the Conference Centre where my meeting was taking place
501253,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Room furniture not even a chair in front of a desk to facilitate working Free WiFi but need for complex login room number birth date etc several times a day Breakfast too crowded with insufficient staff , Walking distance from the Convention Center 
501254,ARCOTEL Kaiserwasser Superior, Some don t like the location because there are unavoidable steps to get to the subway which prove difficult with luggage Dining room prices are high for Vienna but that is to be expected for a location next to an international conference center , During days when Vienna was burning up this place was cool and comfy We live in Vienna but needed to escape our hot flat Staff was helpful We are vegans and the food was great The dining room manager worked with us daily for our healthy meals
