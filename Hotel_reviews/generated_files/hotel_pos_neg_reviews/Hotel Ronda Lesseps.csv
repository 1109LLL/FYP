282411,Hotel Ronda Lesseps, There was power cuts in the hotel on a few occasion maintenance of the hotel disturbed our comfort and stay We would be active and in our hotel and they d knock to move furniture in Basic tools were broken and the hotel needs serious works The staff majority aren t friendly and felt uncomfortable asking questions a poor cab service in the hotel and constant delays The sound proofing of the rooms weren t great and you struggle to sleep because of small noises due to the poor sound insulation in the structure had to change rooms , The location was great and next to a useful station a good cafe around the area and some supermarkets The rooms and beds were good size the bathrooms was good size and clean 
282412,Hotel Ronda Lesseps, The bathroom door is a glass door It is very beautiful but we missed the privacy , Good location close to Parc Guell The hotel and the room are very new the bed is very comfortable The reception 24h also was really good for us due to our arrival time 
282413,Hotel Ronda Lesseps, The underground car park is 20EUR per day that s a rip off Room had pretty old and worn furniture In the bathroom there was only a bar of poor quality soap and shampoo in terms of cosmetics That s it No toothpaste or shower gel Rooms are badly soundproof and beds quite hard There s no kettle no iron although iron board is one the cabinet no fridge or drinks no supplementary tea or coffee very little space in general so no chance of having a breakfast or a cup of tea comfortably Definitely doesn t deserve 4 stars closer to 2 , Bathroom was nicely finished and AC worked well and quiet It s close to underground and walking distance to Park Guell 
282414,Hotel Ronda Lesseps, Our bathroom glass door shattered as one of my friends was taking a shower Very scary Staff did come quick to help and relocated us but we got moved to a room that also has a loose door Mentioned this to staff and was told to simply not close the bathroom door This should have been repaired the same day , Hotel was really nice nice rooms and food was great 
282415,Hotel Ronda Lesseps, Not friendly just a hotel chain , Staff not trained well I speak Spanish and they did not understand me I just think they were not trained enough Not good customer service Hotel kind of cold atmosphere I felt I was in a Holiday Inn in USA
282416,Hotel Ronda Lesseps, Information about parking rates deceiving On website it says parking rate is 20 euros per day BUT it s actually 20 euros per 24 hours and hotel charges a lot for every extra minute We paid 55 euros for parking from 7am Monday morning till check out at noon on Wednesday because we had stayed 5 hours longer than the 48 hours even though we had not been told by the reception that we should move the car after 48 hours or it would cost us a lot more Also there was not kettle in the room for making coffee or tea and no sign on door do not disturb or please make up room Hotel didn t feel like a 4 star hotel but more like a 3 star hotel , Modern design of room 
282417,Hotel Ronda Lesseps, Room location inside house ground floor no window outside just to inner yard small atrium a couple of square metres inside house, Friendliness and professionalism of reception staff
282418,Hotel Ronda Lesseps, The room was on the ground floor with the window looking to the main street It was noisy and we had to keep the blinds on all the time and the window closed for both security and privacy reasons The room had almost no natural light The sheets were not clean and there was no duvet cover , The staff was nice and helpful The location is okay since it is not far from a metro station 
282419,Hotel Ronda Lesseps, Semi transparent wall of bathroom It cause uncomfortable when you travel with friends, Easy to reach from and to airport by metro with few minutes from Lesseps station walk to hotel Also it s close to Guadi s Park Guell famous tourist spot Staff is very nice and hotel is very facilite 
282420,Hotel Ronda Lesseps,No Negative, Also very good prices at the hotel bar including free nibbles with drinks It was nice to find accommodation in a residential neighbourhood so that the restaurants and shops were frequented by the locals rather than tourists Two nearby eateries had excellent food good prices and friendly staff La Palmera for fish and Inka Burger for burgers 
282421,Hotel Ronda Lesseps, Lack of a proper queen bed was a pretty big downside we had two double beds side by side The bathroom was beautiful although it had a glass sliding door instead of a normal door overall it provided less privacy than might be desired , Nice room Very good staff Solid location 
282422,Hotel Ronda Lesseps, see above, The location was a little sketchy I would not go out at night Of course I am travelling solo so couples might find it different The room did not have a refrigerator and ice not available unless you went down to the restaurant and tried to get the bartender to give you a tiny empty glass of it No English TV channels at all Floors were dirty My worst complaint was the front desk giving absolutely incorrect directions When I asked the girl for directions to The Pedrera she said 10 minute walk OK it was AT LEAST 10 miles The food at the restaurant is disgusting Every site very far away No coffee machine microwave wierdest shower ever and if I had to do it again I would not stay here 
282423,Hotel Ronda Lesseps,No Negative, Size and position of the room away from the street were perfect Super quiet room although next door was construction we weren t disturbed once The bathroom was finished only this morning we were the first ones to use it Barrier free shower including massage vents Overall an amazing stay

282425,Hotel Ronda Lesseps, The room we stayed did not have any cooling Our room was on the road side We had to keep the window open to have some cooling from outside But road was noisy It was a bit disturbing , The rooms were clean The staff was very friendly The location was superb Overall it was an amazing experience to stay in this hotel 
282426,Hotel Ronda Lesseps,No Negative, Well the first it s really a good price then we have a metro near the hotel which can takes us almost everywhere the hotel is just like 5 mins walks to the metro to the road Ramble and the beach takes less than 30 mins and the most important thing is the service is really good all the people in this hotel is really really nice and sympathetic they answered all our questions and sometimes they had some really good advices 
282427,Hotel Ronda Lesseps, The hairdryer was a little awkward a button had to kept pressed to operate I would take my own next time I stay there and I hope to one day , The room was very clean beds after a day sightseeing were very very comfortable the bathroom was beautiful the shower was amazing shampoo soap and even small combs no conditioner Location was perfect took just 5 mins to walk to Lesseps metro which took us within minutes of major attractions Staff were all very pleasant

282429,Hotel Ronda Lesseps, The room is not sound proofed at all I had a snoring neighbor and felt as if he was sleeping in my own bed I asked for a room change but did not get it I had 6 nights of very bad sleep There is no bathtub and no mini bar in the room The toiletries were only placed in the bathroom the first night I had to ask for them twice and then I gave up Will surely not stay there again , The location is good just 5 mins walk to the Lesseps metro station the green line the one that goes to La Rambla and 15 mins walk to the entrance of Park Guell Other than that it is really far from anything of interest The breakfast is varied and good 
282430,Hotel Ronda Lesseps, Bathroom window has clear glass This is a problem which I had pointed out to staff on my previous stay a couple of years ago and nothing has been done Bathroom windows should have frosted glass , I never have breakfast at hotels I prefer to have breakfast outside in local bars The reason being that coffee in hotels tends to be instant coffee and not good 
282431,Hotel Ronda Lesseps, There were a few hairs on the wall in the bathroom when I arrived Also the window was open due to the room smelling of smoke , Friendliness of staff location Also value for money 
282432,Hotel Ronda Lesseps, Breakfast is really really poor It is a pity to save money on this it is easy and not costly to do it well , Staff on reception friendly and helpful Location is good walking distance from Park Guell metro station Lesseps 200m away Gracia lovely neighboorhood just further
