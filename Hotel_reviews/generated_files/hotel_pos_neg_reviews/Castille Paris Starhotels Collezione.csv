152041,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Can t really think of a thing there was a fair amount of nearby construction that made getting in out a bit of an inconvenience but obviously that s out of their control , Great location great rooms super helpful staff We were in a crisis stolen passports for a family of 5 simple need was location near Embassy got far beyond that with great rooms a staff that went far beyond to get needed documents printed organized so we could focus on rebooking rest of trip A lifesaver 
152042,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Booked a suite said had two bedrooms one single bed and one double bed Upon check in was shown a single bedroom with a sofa they said was a sofa bed Bathroom was tiny not like pictures They refused to change room said was the marketing departments fault Not a good experience at all ,No Positive
152043,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Elevator floor never properly cleaned during our 12 nights stay Sofas and chairs in the bar and lobby area full cat hairs lost by the hotel pet , Perfect location Most tourist attraction are in walking range 
152044,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Nothing at all, Super Location Unbelievably friendly courteous and helpful staff A cool and extremely well behave cat at the property a hidden gem of a hotel 
152045,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Hotel should come with free breakfast as room price is already expensive, Excellent concierge and front desk services Location is next door to Chanel flagship store and Super convenient to hop to Chanel hop to hotel to drop your purchase and hop to do more shopping All designers boutique are within 5 min walk and Galerie Lafayette and Printemps within 10 min walk Oh the resident Cat Heliot is so adorable Abd the centre attraction at Castille We also love the Etro Toiletries set 
152046,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, The staff were fantastic from check in to every query we had with the concierge they made us feel like royalty Amazing location and a beautiful duplex upgraded room We will definitely visit again soon 
152047,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, We had a room facing the street Rue Cambon but the noise on the street in the middle of night was very annoying and quite loud, I liked the friendly service This is my 4th time at this hotel and every time I come I m greeted with a lovely smile and great service
152048,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Next door to Chanel has its charm and it is dangerous hold on to your credit cards Castille is a typical Parisian Hotel the rooms are small but cosy My room was on the six floor and the elevator did not work the first day Great workout if you want to stay fit The room was quiet and the bed was comfortable The bathrooms look a bit run down and could need a touch up Overall good experience For a business trip to fashion week it is the perfect fit, The breakfast choice is ok but it is not worth another 30 EURO Just go around the corner in one of the cafes and enjoy a cafe au lait and a fresh croissant Sit back and look at the fashionable Parisians passing by More fun 
152049,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, The food service department could be better , Amazing Concierge I have never seen this kind of helpful persons in my life They are the best Thanks to Xaiver and Romain Please trust their recommendations about food 
152050,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, The bath tub and shower should only have a true walk in shower The lobby upholstery is a bit tired, Staff is very attentive and cordial Loved the restaurant experience Fine Italian food and good ambiance as attentive service Breakfast host is very professional and works with and as much as the staff Delicious variety for breakfast Thank you 
152051,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, The mirror was cracked and the bedside drawers were positioned so that the wardrobe door wouldn t open The bathroom did not match the quality of the bedroom it was a little tired and the shower far too small , The location is great
152052,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, The room was a little on the small side but then you don t go to Paris to spend all of your time in a hotel room , The staff were outstanding and the hotel is in a very convenient location within walking distance of most of the major attractions in Paris 
152053,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, The corridor of the room is so old The mirror and beds need to renovate, The location is great Decoration of lobby is fantastic The restaurant is great
152054,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, The room was small but it s Paris so to be expected The breakfast was expensive and we had to have it everyday to get the lower price We decided against it , The location was perfect for us The staff were excellent Our view was lovely from the 6th floor The lobby was warm and inviting 
152055,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, No twin room suite Inconsistence staff capability One at the concierge suggested us to hire 2 taxi for 5 people with 5 big baggages because he could not guarantee a wagon for all of us The next day got a phone call from the concierge advised us a big taxi would suit Apparently the latter gentleman was more experienced and thoughtful , The location is unbeatable if the purpose of your travel is shopping 
152056,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, The decor in our bedroom is great The ground floor seems to be in two parts one more contemporaryear and another to the left looks tired and at odds with he rest , The staff are very helpful and responsive combined with a great location and beautiful decor 
152057,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, We felt it very expensive food and drinks were also highly priced but I guess that s Paris , Location close to metro and quiet at night Comfy bed and the bathroom was big Staff couldn t have been more helpful 
152058,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Over priced mini bar and bar Disappointed as says you have a bath in the superior room but we didn t just a stand in shower Mentioned it was my mrs birthday and didn t offer to do anything special I wouldn t expect this for free but should offer some flower or something for the room at additional cost , Like the location very friendly staff 
152059,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Everything was perfect , Beautiful hotel in a perfect location couldn t be better The stuff very nice and friendly The breakfast very good as in all Starhotels Extremely comfortable bed in a beautifly decorated room Even if it s in the center very quiet hotel 
152060,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Small rooms no coffee makers you have no feeling that it is really 5 hotel , Central location though it is not on a walking distance from many major attractions 
152061,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, The breakfast was not so excellent Very little space for the clothes , The junior suite was very nice and also the position of the hotel Staff very kind and professional 
152062,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Horrible staff totally unfair and would not do anything to make you happy My impression that they have zero interest in you coming back The worst is that they cheat if you asked for one feature you like in your room to be they will downgrade you will pretend naive as if they are meeting your request in reality they are milking your credit card , I liked the interior it was clean and minimalistic style exactly what you want in the 21 century Bed was great also 
152063,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Room at the end of the hallway on the 1st floor slightly noisy due to the machinery nearby, Room design is nice Private parking Hotel staff reception desk providing great service
152064,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Everything was wonderful with nothing not to like Don t expect a grand lobby however expect quality over quantity , Castille Paris is an older intimate charming parisian hotel in a very good location that is walking distance to many of the main museums and surrounded by high end shopping Upon check in we were informed our room was upgraded to a mini suite from a standard room as we were a party of 3 Service is very attentive and they went out of their way to help us locate taxi driver when we left cellphone in car on way to airport It is unheard of that a lost cellphone is returned but the staff of Castille were on top of this immediately and arrangements were made to return the phone back to us in United States within the week That speaks volume of how they take care of their guests 
152065,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Could the room be a bit more spacious Probably but I know what to do to make it bigger take a suite not the basic room , There were three negative issues from Tripadviser which put me into doubt cat i don t like pets in the hotel am allergic bad breakfast and small room Re the cat i couldn t notice it s presence at all the hotel in general and the room in particular were immaculately clean which was a shame as my daughter was very excited to play with it re breakfast absolutely delicious No it is not kilometers of wasteful choice but one would find everything you need for a healthy fresh delicious certain things too much start of the day pffff still mouthwatering when remember Re room size well it is not Texas it is the heart of Paris old Europe Want bigger pay more We also very much appreciated the internal terrace of the hotel which gives the opportunity to be in the fresh air and without being looked at 
152066,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, The rooms should be equipped with atleast tea and coffee facilities And a couple of complimentary water bottles , Extremely friendly and helpful staff we were there for pfw so location was excellent It s more of a boutique hotel
152067,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Would have liked bottles of water available in our room for staff in restaurant bar to be more accommodating to guests of the hotel we arrived late came down to restaurant for a meal 10 minutes after last order told only option was to eat room service in our room , Great location rooms were so neat clean very Parisian chic Restaurant was also great 
152068,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Our room was very noisy Lots of slamming doors trash truck at 8am Sunday morning Not a lot of personality The cat was even snobby But cute , The location was great 
152069,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, the door of the WC which is strongly closing behind you leaving you closed in a very small room the WC room , Good and fresh breakfast nice lounge bar also for business meetings changing of bathroom towels 2 times per day chocolate every evening great location in the city center reception staff very efficient 
152070,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, the rooms are quite small but perfectly comfortable and fab location, the staff here are really wonderful helpful welcoming and knowledgable they made the whole experienced feel special and I felt very well looked after
152071,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Coffee tea facilities in the room would have been nice, Upgraded on arrival v comfy beds fab location generally very calm stylish If felt like a real treat to stay there with my daughter Will definitely return Staff incredibly helpful too 
152072,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, No tea and coffee making facilities and when this was commented on when checking out we were told this would have been provided if we had asked We had no idea this would have been available as there was no info , Lovely courtyard for having a drink 
152073,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Rooms were way too small for what your paying There s an outdated smell in all of the rooms I wouldn t classify this as a 5 hotel You would probably get better value and facilities at a nearby, Location for shopping and nearby access to metro
152074,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Absolute best staff in Paris perfect location fabulous room and bathroom delicious breakfasts gorgeous courtyard for evening drinks a magical place Had already booked another hotel but saw Hotel Castille on Instagram and switched best decision we ever made 
152075,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Room is poorly maintained and not clean housekeeping job is very sloppy and never replenish amenity I have to make extra call for shower gel tissue shower cap etc everyday during my stay No mineral water supply at night Elevator is not clean with smell I changed room 3 times each room has some level of outdated odor Front desk staffs are indifference Concierge ignored my inquiry on restaurants for two days until a senior concierge on board who took care of all inquiry Overall I am surprised it is a 5 star hotel , Location
152076,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, The room is too small for the money we were paying , Loved the location of the hotel as well as the hotel itself The team was super helpful and helped us a lot with recommendations The service is quite efficient from room service to dry cleaning 
152077,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, This was a 5 star hotel but they do not have tea coffe in the room At least not for free What hotel in that class don t have free tea etc in the room I v been to 2 stars hotel that got that covered I got very suprised when I realized I had to call room service everytime I wanted a cup of tea And pay for it Also very nice to have them call to check up on you but the do not disturb sign you hang outside on the door nob do not mean anything in this hotel They called us all the time when they could clean the room when we where going out if they could clean the room if we would like them to clean the room If they could do something about the bugs and the mole in the bathroom that would be good The bed was very hard and it was easy to hear the TV voices from the other rooms , Elliot their hotel cat 3
152078,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, The hotel lobby looks like a 3 star hotel very worn out Quite disappointing , The location is excellent for shopping and walking arround We stayed in a deluxe room The room was renovated and large for a hotel in Paris 
152079,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, The room service was poor quality of food , Excellent location super nice decoration nice and silent room The restaurant in the terrace is really nice 
152080,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Did not like being charged held at check in for incidentals and 2 nights stay Bad form Decor is unattractive for such an area Room was only ok with no view , Location was good Decor was dated Needs updating Room was quiet 
152081,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Absolutely nothing , Breakfast was fantastic everything was fresh and absolutely delicious The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in The location was incredible next door to the main Chanel shop and from out bedroom we could see the Chanel atelier Service was impeccable and the attention to details was incredible very personal I absolutely loved the look of the hotel absolutely fantastic One of the best hotels we ever stayed at 
152082,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, The desk and tables in the room were dusty when we arrived and were never wiped down during our stay No pillow menu no tea and coffee facilities provided toilet wouldn t flush so we had to go downstairs to the lobby No shower gel provided so had to buy our own Wood was chipped in places around the room bathroom consisted of a seperate toilet Very old the shower was tiny and the paint was peeling inside there Tiles were dirty and dated Needs renovation badly in our room at least Not a bad hotel at all but certainly not five star standard The male concierge was very nice and helpful However the female concierge who was working on Monday 22nd February was incredible rude and unhelpful We asked about the advertised airport shuttle service additional fee and were told that it doesn t exist but they could call us a taxi When I asked the concierge why they advertise a shuttle service she blamed booking com and wouldn t take any responsibility on the hotels behalf and was very rude raised her voice to talk over me etc The reception staff were lovely though as was everyone else we encountered but our experience with the female concierge soured the whole stay and I wouldn t stay there again it s not worth the money , Nice bedroom bed was very comfortable room service menu was good Nice bar downstairs with a jazz band on a Thursday night The Italian restaurant was nice too Great location close to the louvre and the Opera area 
152083,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, It would have been nice to have a kettle also I would advise that the items placed in a tray are listed that they are not compmailtry and a very expensive as I had a shocked upon returning back from my trip to pay 37 pounds Ie 12 euros for nuts and sweets for a 5 stars I am very suprised that they didn t inform us that they don t give compalitry items, I loved location and staff were helpful the food was nice rooms where nice size very clean lovely bedding sheets pillows
152084,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Rooms are very tiny , The staff was extremely friendly I lost during the check out my wallet I know its sounds weird but it really happen However after 30 minutes the lady from the reception called me to ask when I pick it up Later on the reception I saw that their staff put it into a safe and in addition the covered the wallet up Really nice and professional 
152085,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, We were unlucky the heating did not work in our room the first hours and we suffered before we got upgraded to a suite at no cost but we wished not to suffer in that cold day during that 1 long hour, Modern restoration with an authentic old charm AND LOVELY STAFF in France 
152086,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, The hotel is tired holes in curtain in a duplex very small bathroom and as soon as you open your suitcase you cannot moved CHANGED ROOM no mini bar requested extra towels before I left for dinner Came back no towel The bathroom shower side was dirty with mildew crack paint disgusting AND the lobby smelled sewer pomp all afternoon DISGUSTING Staff apologized housekeeper were all over the lobby with bathroom spray totally disgusting when I checked in also it was 2 Trainees behind the desk and the senior agent did not move a finger to help them how to expedite my checking I travel the world and if I did not prepaid my booking I will have checked out It s a poor 5 stars a bare 3 stars do not be fool Location is great but BIG DISAPOINTMENT Too expensive for what it is will NEVER GO BACK or send my clients that I book trip to Paris , Loved the location
152087,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Our room was opposite the service lift which was noisy with staff coming and going at night time , Excellent location and friendly staff Room was very clean 
152088,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Bathroom amenity product so standard very typical motel group look alike no luxury with the group logo and cheap packaging Sorry but they could do better even others 4 or 5 stars boutique hotels offer unique bathroom product such as from joe malone dyptique aesop Hermes etc , Perfect Location especially for those shopaholic Service were genuine and professional Beautiful hotel with with traditional Parisian style 
152089,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, I don t have negative opinion suffice it to say that the hotel entrance is pretty small even though five stats hotel , The hotel location is convinient Easy to access many popular sightseeing place and metro station My memory is correct it takes only 8 min to 2 major department store by on my foot 
152090,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Sound insulation of the superior room was terrible That is not acceptable for such an hotel it is just similar to the average motel 6 Window insulation is ok but the wall were so thin that we could hear anything from the 2 neighbors I will skip detail insulation with upstairs floor was ok but not great Hope not all rooms are like that I was disappointed by staff reaction I was only offered a discount for a future stay , Good location clean
152091,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, The hotel is beautiful lovely rooms and the location is very central Galeries Lafayette is a five minute walk away and Champs Elysees also about five minutes walk Chanel lovers will love the fact it s located next door to 31 rue Cambon The staff are very helpful and friendly 
152092,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Had there been the slightest thing wrong I would have commented but there wasn t , Location superb staff very competent and room well appointed A great experience
152093,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, There is a wonderful knowledgable concierge I slept like a baby It was quiet and well appointed Fantastically situated Use uber They are all in jackets open the door for you and gives a treat
152094,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Nothing , Staffs When we had a difficult situation in Paris Nov13th 2015 night they are very calm and told me what to do what we should not do That made me relieved 
152095,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, The rooms were nice but certainly nothing to write home about Extremely small far smaller than I ever expected The toilet is was separate from the bathroom but there is barely enough room to sit on the toilet without your legs hitting the door We splashed out a bit on this room wouldn t generally stay in a hotel of this type of quality but we didn t really see where that extra money went We ve stayed in hotels much cheaper that have just as good if not better rooms and facilities We didn t eat at the hotel the prices are just astronomical 30 Euros for breakfast is absolutely absurd though pretty typical for this part of Paris I m led to believe , The staff are second to none Every single staff member we encountered was extremely professional and friendly No request was too hard and management should be pleased to know their establishment is being represented so well 
152096,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, The other concierge Hoffman could be more polite composed and professional His commented were raw with immature behaviour especially for someone that works in this hotel which pride yourself with excellence His bar of service doesn t match the hotel s expectations , Very friendly staff that are too notched concierge Patrick has amazing customer focus he s very resourceful with timely assistance and patience Reception team Aurelli Leon Isabelle etc are very helpful too 
152097,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Room service is horrible Space of room and ammenities and general available services not up to par with price or comparable hotels in the area and rating , Location is amazing 
152098,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Staff location cleanliness and an upgrade to a junior suite for free The room was quiet as requested and was very stylish and again clean I will go back to this hotel Thank you 
152099,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, The room was like a hallway with a room on one side with a toilet only not a sink for washing hands or anything else just a small room with a toilet at the other side the bed with about half meter to the walls on each direction and then after the actual bathroom without the toilet just the sink for washing face and hands and the shower This is supposed to be something really cool but is not I don t understand how this could be a five star hotel anyway , Location
152100,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, Small bedrooms for the superior rooms one room had toilet seprate from washroom, Nice staff friendly not busy hotel great location clean and good housekeeping 
152101,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, It s been a number of years since my last trip to Paris and the pressure was on to now share the city s beauty with my husband The concierge was so helpful with giving me the necessary help to get us around the city Again the location was perfect 
152102,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, woke up with a dog poop in front of my door and they didn t even bother to apologize unqualified concierge that still used a book to find a restaurant which i found in a minute using google, location
152103,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, All staff were very friendly and helpful The courtyard restaurant is just delightful and atmospheric in the evening Food was delicious The position is perfect if shopping is a passion Fabulous restaurant three minutes walk over San Honore on Rue Gambon 
152104,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione, If I have to come up with a negative in the interests of balance it would be the wifi which was free for the first 24h then needed to be paid for Although I stayed for one night only so didn t affect me Given the cost of the hotel and 5 star credentials I would have been disappointed to have to pay for this if staying longer , Very friendly and helpful staff couldn t ask for more on that front They were able to offer some great advice on what to see whilst in Paris Beautiful and quiet room with lovely fittings and furnishings plus a very comfortable bed The location is excellent and you really are right in the centre of Paris close to all the big sights The metro stop is about a 5 min walk from the hotel 
152105,Castille Paris Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, The hotel was beautiful and it was in a perfect location in Paris I ve visited Paris many times and I will definitely visit this hotel again
