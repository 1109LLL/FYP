50892,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, It s a compact hotel and rooms are very close together so doors banging might be the only negative But this wasn t much of a problem in our experience , Close to Tube station modern bedroom design complimentary drinks snacks gadgets in rooms clean comfortable even had Sky Sports on the TV

50917,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Bed was relatively small but still comfy , The staff were fantastic we had an issue with the coffee machine in our room and so they arranged to bring us coffee from the restaurant whenever we needed it and provided us with a complimentary breakfast They were fantastic 
50918,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Having paid for a cooked breakfast we were served by a new member of staff in training She wasn t the most attentive or particularly polite which came as a shock after all the other staff members being so polite , The rooms were very modern and the hotel is in an excellent location a few minutes from the Tower of London The desk staff were all so warm and friendly

50928,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, The bed is far too small and the rooms noisy as you hear the neighbours above making lots of noise while walking in the room as well as the side rooms , The location is great not too noisy outside in the night The way the rooms are decorated 
50929,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, I can t honestly think of anything that I disliked, I had the executive double room and for London it was spacious with good modern contemporary decor The bed was very comfortable The Nespresso was a nice touch The staff were very pleasant and efficient even leant me a phone charger 
50930,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Had a free mini bar with water and a couple of soft drinks which was good but would have been e xcellent if this was replenished whilst you were out for the evening , This is a small hotel but has all you need We stayed in an executive room as it was only 9 more to stay in this rom Booked through Booking com Staff at front desk were very helpful stored our bags as we arrived in the morning gave us direction to local attractions and reception was always manned Lovely room mini bar with two bottles of still and two of sparkling water It also had a Diet Coke Coke and Sprite plus a couple of bars of chocolate there is a safe in the room and also a a mobile phone that you can take out with you with free internet access and calls That s a nice touch Lovely bathroom too with a powerful shower Lovely breakfast with a good choice 
50931,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable The staff were very friendly The facilities in the room were good Free mini bar with soft drinks and a free phone and internet to use if required Breakfast was excellent with a good choice of hot or cold food 
50932,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Noisy pipes took a while to get to sleep but once asleep couldn t hear them, Staff at check in were efficient and friendly Love the free mini bar and phone in room Beds were very comfy and room was quirky and clean
50933,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, The hotel is poor value for money The loo in the room I had must have been designed by someone who never tried to get to it stuck up against a cupboard and behind the open door The staff are smiley but some are not very competent The restaurant is expensive breakfast with totally unjustified service charges applied automatically The hot food was reasonably warm but pre prepared and straight out of the bain marie so limp and tasteless Tip walk along the road to the Chamberlain and have breakfast for half the price and three times the value , Location is good relative to Aldgate Station and the business areas
50934,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, The hot breakfast was lovely however the buffet cold breakfast particularly on the Sunday was a little sparse and needed restocking more regularly The team seemed a little stretched and one member in particular needed to be a little more welcoming , The staff at Reception were friendly and helpful Everyone we passed on our way to our room said hello The room was lovely and clean and had a free mini bar holding snacks and soft drinks which we really appreciated The hotel went out of its way with the little extras that make the difference such as a free paper and welcoming staff the location is great 
50935,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, There was a problem which I do not wish to discuss but it could have been done by the guest before me , Room was nice bed comfy mini bar was well stocked and free Near Spitalsfield Market and tube stations 
50936,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, the breakfast as you could have the buffet breakfast but this was not re stocked and when we went to breakfast there was nothing left we had to ask and we waited almost an hour for egg and soldiers and an omelette which was poor and we weren t even offered more tea or coffee while we waited , rooms are spacious and well presented with a large bathroom but missed not having a bath 
50937,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept on but I missed having a bedside cabinet on my side as well , The sixth floor suite had amazing views of the City Skyline including several iconic towers It was luxurious with interesting decor complimentary snacks in the fridge and plenty of toiletries in the stylish bathroom The staff were extremely friendly and helpful 
50938,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, I had ordered some food with Deliveroo and the driver was not allowed to deliver the food to my door I had to get changed and pick up my food from Reception Also I was not able to give the Deliveroo driver a tip as they had already left I was told by Reception that they do not allow them to deliver direct to my door despite this being allowed during my previous stay I have eaten the Room Service food provided by the hotel many times and it s delicious But the menu has not changed in over a year which is why I ordered Deliveroo , Beautiful room with very comfortable bed and a luxurious bathroom Free mini bar is great 
50939,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill,No Negative, The staff were extra friendly and did everything possible to accommodate us We had a special request which they took care of at short notice Laura at reception was great Inclusive minibar was a nice luxury as it s not very normal to see 
50940,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, It was obvious that the room was designed for single occupancy as there was only one bath robe and the tea and coffee supplies were geared for one person In addition there was only one easy chair and the room was too small for two people This hotel would have been ideal if we were purely on business overnight in the financial district however as we were combining business and pleasure we were looking for somewhat better on site facilities , The receptionist Katia was really welcoming She provided us with maps of London and on checking out advised we could leave our bags and collect them later On final departure she ordered us a car to take us to the train station and let us know the price before booking the car cautioning us that payment with a debit card would incur a 10 surcharge 
50941,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, This is our third stay For two previous stays I would give this hotel a score of 10 out of 10 This time there was a problem with air conditioning in one of our rooms I have to point out that the staff made an effort to resolve the situation and a heater was provided within an hour as a temporary solution , Great location close to Tower Hill and Aldgate stations Amazing staff friendly polite and very helpful Good size rooms with hardwood floors and superb shower Tea and coffee facilities are great the minibar with complimentary chocolate bottled water and soft drinks is a treat It is the cleanest hotel I ve ever seen The windows isolate any noise from outside so the rooms are very quite and peaceful Since it is mainly a business hotel there no screaming children or loud groups of friends In one word perfect 
50942,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, The breakfast was not particularly impressive No muesli and no granola even Must try harder , The decor in the rooms was really unusually tasteful and made me feel at home 
50943,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, We were on a three day leisure break and advised preferred a high level quiet room appreciate not always possible however we were given a low level room on the street front Our room neighbours were possibly workers as we heard clock alarms door banging 7am 8am not much of a relaxing holiday, The bed was comfy room a decent size
50944,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Room price was on offer otherwise out of my price range, Comfy bed plump pillows fab funky decor spotlessly clean loved the bathroom polite attentive staff 1min from Tube
50945,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Staff in dining room unwelcoming and looked depressed to be there Better music in dining room just make it a bit more inviting , The room was very comfortable cleaned to a high level staff on reception very warm and friendly location is good as you are right beside a good tube station and Tower of London 
50946,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill,No Negative, An excellent boutique hotel located just a couple of minutes walk from Tower of London and Tower Bridge Staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful Free water and soft drinks and chocolates are provided in the bar fridge in your room and replenished daily during your stay Comfortable bed and well appointed bathroom TV and speedy WiFi are provided Late checkout 12pm 2pm for members of IHG Rewards Club is handy FYI the nearby Tower Hill station has been recently upgraded with a lift from the ticket concourse to the platforms This means you can get between the underground and the hotel step free 
50947,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill,No Negative, I liked the look of all the rooms here but We were upgraded to a suite for my partners birthday visit and it was just perfect Staff wee so friendly we would definitely go back 
50948,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, On the top floor there was a generator hum during the night My room very comfortable but odd not to have a bedside table on each side of the bed , Location is very good and the staff were exceptionally helpful Nice touch to have free contents of in room fridge 
50949,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill,No Negative, Good value to money Good location Very large room and bath room In our room surprisingly we ve found Nesspresso coffee machine Free minibar soft drinks and chocolate snaks 
50950,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Nothing , Room d cor was thoughtful quirky and had great style The bathroom was amazing Spacious clean and a lovely powerful shower The bed was a dream to sleep on 
50951,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Continental breakfast was good but way over priced Didn t really like the location too busy too much construction going on but that s just a personal preference no fault of the hotel But it was very convenient to tube stop , The staff was amazing so helpful and friendly The room was very pretty and well appointed The free mini bar stocked with tea coffee soft drinks and chocolate was a wonderful perk Super comfy bed too 
50952,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Nothing , Rooms very clean and comfortable with stylish attractive interior design staff very helpful non intrusive very professional Would definitely stay in this hotel again 
50953,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, The room smelt odd furniture polish No hot food in the late night roomservice menu but we didn t know that until we got back and tried to order chips Had to make do with crisps , Large room I think it was superior Very comfortable bed and pillows Check in staff were really helpful and printed gig tickets for me no problem
50954,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, There was nothing that I didn t like The hotel didn t seem to have many additional facilities but for its location and as a comfortable base to explore from I wouldn t have used them anyway , The rooms are modern well presented quite and clean The free mini bar of water soft drinks and chocolate was an excellent little extra Being really close to two underground stations is another great benefit 
50955,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Nothing, I love everything about this hotel Rooms are lovely Nespresso coffee minibar treats and the staff are really nice My first choice every time 
50956,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill,No Negative, Was easy to find using public transport close to station and buses The staff were very friendly and welcoming The room although small was very convenient clean and practical I found the bed very comfortable nice hot shower Decent sized work desk and the complementary treats in mini bar were a nice touch 
50957,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, wifi was a bit hit and miss in the room TV was situated in an odd place , Comfortable bed extra friendly staff especially Brigatta breakfast Close distance to the Tower 
50958,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, There was no bath in our rooms so we were unable to give our grand daughter a proper bath , The rooms were spacious with comfortable beds Staff were very helpful and friendly 
50959,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Bathroom was very small and was awkward to get in and out of , Very comfy beds lovely bedroom and extremely accomodating staff Very easy to get to on the underground 
50960,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, The blanket albeit comfy is quite thick and heavy and we ended up feeling pretty warm at night despite switching the air conditioning to the lowest temperature , We were on our honeymoon and they upgraded us to the Tower Bridge Suite What a lovely gesture The staff were very attentive to any queries that we had and the hotel is located within a 5 min walking distance to the Tower of London Very convenient 
50961,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Nothing, It was a real pleasant stay Loved the hotel The only bad thing is that we only had 1 night there The room was sooooo spacious Looking forward to staying again 
50962,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Breakfast not included and was very expensive food not great Was sitting in the restaurant bar area and had my phone stolen there were no other people around other than staff Reported this but no luck Tried to add extra nights stay on and they wanted 300 twice as much Wouldn t budge even though I am a regular customer and had booked 4 nights in a row already Had to get another hotel across town , Lovely spacious rooms very clean bed was very comfortable free soft drinks and snacks in mini bar Good rail links 
50963,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Just a minor quibble Hotel has a very small reception area only just has space for 2 armchairs , I had an executive room very nice room good size beautiful modern design lots of windows and daylight nice and comfortable bed furniture looked new everything was in good shape and all equipment worked fine air condition bath room fittings elevators Staff was extremely friendly and professional Hotel is in walking distance to the financial center and the Tower of London and very close to Aldgate station of the circle line Quiet too The hotel is located in a relatively quiet street has well isolated windows and does not have a noisy bar 
50964,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, We needed an early breakfast for participation in the london marathon which had been a problem in previous years but despite reassurance that it would be available there was no provision However the restaurant staff rang through to the chef who had just arrived and quickly provided some porridge It had to go back initially but they did sort it out and then offered it as a complimentary service so fair play , Great spot easy transport links great local facilities fantastic rooms friendly staff 
50965,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill,No Negative, I d liked the fact that the staff let me check in at 10am following a cleaned room even though check in time is at 3pm as per website The room is always wonderfully cleaned even though I didn t put up Please clean sign The staff are awfully good at what they do in providing efficient and professiona customer service and always with a big smile I would without a heartbeat return to stay at indigo at minories These staff are to keep 
50966,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, A lot of the nearby bars and restaurants were shut on Saturday night which was a shame as this is the night us Northerners normally head out Not the hotel s fault obviously but just means you may have to travel a bit further , Staff were great and very kind and considerate towards us The rooms were clean and tidy and very comfy not to mention beautifully decorated The location was excellent Only a few minutes walk to Aldgate station and Tower Hill nearby Short walk to Brick Lane but plenty of bars and restaurants nearby We definitely recommend you try the Thai restaurant next door it was delicious and so gorgeous inside We stayed here to enjoy Harry Potter studios and to visit Camden For Harry Potter studios we went from Aldate to Euston via the Victoria line I think and then from there via train to Watford Juxton where a bus took us to the Warner Brothers studio for a return fare of 2 50
50967,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, The location is in the business district so everything shuts down early at night We had to walk quite a distance to find a good restaurant and it seemed to be difficult to find locals who were willing to help us with directions , The room has a very trendy and unique look to it and also very comfortable The staff was very friendly and went above and beyond to assist us with directions We would definitely book a stay at this hotel again 
50968,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Breakfasts rather expensive but there is choice just to have coffee and juice for example Would have liked a before bed drink but bar was closed , We were upgraded and room was one of the nicest we have stayed in in London Different with extra nice touches 
50969,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, There isn t an obvious hotel bar not a major issue A little pricey compared to others in the area but impressive rooms , The rooms are lovely large with a 4 poster bed and very stylish decor The addition of the mini fridge with complimentary soft drinks and chocolate was excellent Everything that you need from a hotel toiletries hairdryer robes etc 
50970,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill,No Negative, Simply excellent From the excellent customer service to the spacious superbly appointed room And the room service food was delicious One of my favourite hotels in London

50975,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Nothing Cannot find any fault with the hotel or our stay , Quiet ambience and boutique feel but central location and excellent amenities Brilliant view from suite of the gherkin shard and other skyscrapers Friendly staff delicious breakfast and a very comfortable stay overall Very short walk from Aldgate or Tower Hill tube station Will definitely earmark for a return visit next time I am looking for a city break 
50976,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, No fault of the hotel but the roadworks and diversions made it very difficult getting to the hotel by car Plan ahead where you are going to park , The room was amazing loved the d cor and design of the hotel overall staff were absolutely lovely and went out of their way to deliver exceptional customer service
50977,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill,No Negative, My second stay here Very nice and friendly staff Perfect rooms ideal location for doing business in the City Very close to Tower City and the tube Lots of nice restaurants with lots of food options Will come again
50978,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, There isn t anything I don t like I always stay here in London, The staff at this hotel are very friendly and professional They will help you with any request and offer you assistance all the time 
50979,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill,No Negative, Service was very good as was the breakfast which was included in my rate Location is fine if you want to be in this part of town Very short walk to Aldgate tube 
50980,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Nothing to dislike here , Hotel was very modern very clean and staff very welcoming and efficient We had an upgraded room to a suite which was excellent We asked for a quiet room with views and got exactly that because we arrived late the curtains were all drawn and the bed cushions removed it is attention to detail like this that makes the difference Value wise we booked last minute and got a great deal for hotel just 5 10 mins walk from Tower Bridge 
50981,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, No car park In City of London can t be expected but can t fault anything else , We had a water leak in the bathroom Within 20 mins the hotel rang and asked permission to move us to another room I granted this and upon returning later that evening found everything had been moved and placed in identical position in the new room Amazing attention to detail Excellent rooms and facilities 
50982,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, There was a rainforest shower head and also an additional shower head however this didn t fit into the fitting so I was unable to use this, The decor of the rooms were fabulous The wooden floor the London painted walls the beds etc
50983,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Haven t got any negatives, Staff were all extremely helpful and welcoming Check in was quick and easy Room was outstanding bed hugely comfortable bathroom was clean and good size Quiet location Would stay again 
50984,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Very little in the way of public areas But we really only slept in the hotel so this was not a problem , The location was very good for the attractions we wished to visit The room was very clean comfortable and quiet The water soft drinks etc in the minibar were complimentary which was nice And free wi fi We didn t eat at the hotel but there are lots of restaurants nearby 
50985,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, No bedside cabinet to put things on so had to spread personal items on the floor Nespresso machine was a nice touch but the area for making hot drinks was dark wood and had no lighting so it was difficult to see what you were doing I booked on the basis of breakfast at 12 95 but at breakfast I was then presented with a full priced menu Waitresses didn t speak enough english to sort this could only manage to take orders providing there were t any complications , Upgraded to a suite on arrival which was very comfortable Ate evening meal and breakfast at the hotel both of which were very good 
50986,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, The staff looked miserable at breakfast and at reception and you need to stock some umbrellas for guests the reception staff on the evening stood looking gormless at me asking for an umbrella to walk to our restaurant At the point of them realizing there weren t any it may be polite to ask if a taxi needed ordering Interaction with the guests , The quiet location and ease of getting off the tube to the hotel
50987,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, The location of the hotel is in the financial district a stone s throw away from Tower Bridge It is useful to note that if you are staying at the weekend most of the restaurants close as all of the district shuts down Although St Katherine Dock is 5 mins walk away with great places to eat and drink , The hotel itself was fabulous and the staff could not have been more helpful Free non alcoholic mini bar with drinks chocolate and biscuits It was super clean which is important to us and we had 2 suites and 1 double and the standard was all the same great Our party was mum dad 21 year old 13 year old and two grans in 70 s and we were all catered for We ate in the Minories Cau Thai square and were all different and al yummy but don t forget your wallet for Thai Square We are going to London in September and have already booked into this hotel it was so good

50990,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Nothing could really have been better We just thought it was a little pricey even for London as there were no leisure facilities in the hotel pool gym ect more like a boutique hotel but location was great for Tower of London on foot , The rooms were very comfy and individually decorated very friendly staff and great breakfast 
50991,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, No real dislikes although some things about the room suggested it was more for a single occupant such as only one set of dressing gown and slippers and one comfortable chair but staff were so helpful I have no doubt they would have provided these if we d asked , Room size decor complimentary snacks and drinks and the shower were all nice Breakfast restaurant and the buffet were nice too and staff were happy to be flexible on food for my fianc e who is a vegan Staff were really amazingly friendly throughout Luggage storage was very handy too as allowed us to continue to explore without the suitcase after we d checked out 
50992,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Only thing I didn t like was that my card was charged twice for a hold which was frustrating , Great location just down the road from the Tower of London Rooms were modern and well decorated and beds were very comfy 
50993,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, For several nights stay the cabinet cupboard too small to fit several jackets skirts etc See comments below regarding room size worn chair and breakfast buffet , Location convenient for City close to both Aldgate and Tower Hill tube stations Room was not big but bathroom more so Chair at table worn In general nice d cor Cooked breakfast was good but buffet had rather limited choices 
50994,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill,No Negative, I was upgraded to the apartment and the room was amazing The room was cleaned and while I was out the housekeeping came in and closed my curtains put water on the bedside cabinet The room was fully loaded with everything that was needed 
50995,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill,No Negative, Staff is very attentive friendly and service oriented There were some complimentary treats in the minibar soft drinks chocolade Very modern and clean Not far away from a underground station but the station on lines that need change to more central lines 
50996,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Ac was making a noise all night on the roof sounding like a helicopter but it didn t bother us THAT much , We were upgraded to the tower bridge suite free of charge and although you could not see tower bridge it was worth it 
50997,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Few if any drawers in the bedroom so storage had to be in the luggage or hung in the wardrobe , Good buffet breakfast mini bar in the room was useful with free soft drinks fair trade chocolate and fruit juice replenished every day We were upgraded to a superior room which was very comfortable and spacious Good location for the Tower of London and environs Aldgate tube station 2 min walk away Tower Hill tube about 5 mins so good connections As its in the city it s quiet at weekends

51006,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Some times the floors above were a bit creaky and the boiler for the shower above was a little noisy late at night , We found the staff extremely helpful and welcoming every time we walked in the front door On our first day katia marked out all the tube stops which made our trip easier she was very pleasent and efficient

51023,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, They might want to review their breakfast offering I was given a deal but I had a breakfast meeting and it was expensive for my non resident colleague, I am a return visitor and would recommend this as an excellent base for business in the City or visiting the Tower Bridge area
51024,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill,No Negative, Great location next to Tower of London and underground stations Staff lovely and helpful Rooms clean modern and very trendy Would definitely book here again I ve stayed in Hotel Indigo in Glasgow and both fantastic Very impressed 
51025,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, My opinion is that a hotel claiming to be 4 and charging the prices it does we paid over 650 for three nights B B should offer more The lobby consists of an extremely small area in which there are only two chairs for guests to use There is nowhere to sit and relax out of the bedroom The bar which closes at 21 30 is extremely limited and doubles as the breakfast room Our executive double room was supposed to have a separate seating area which was not the case and had only one comfortable seat not ideal in a double room I reported a faulty lamp in the room which was not fixed The breakfast was acceptable despite being let down by for example cheap and bitter orange juice poured into the dispenser from a carton Coffee was served in cafetieres that need replacing and which were plunged by staff as soon as the water was put in For the price we paid we could have stayed in a much better hotel with better facilities Whilst it was ok our stay was disappointing in many respects , The room was clean and very comfortable with a really nice bathroom The hotel location is good with Aldgate tube station being around the corner and Tower Gateway DLR station only a few minutes walk away Staff were quite friendly and helpful 
51026,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Loved the hotel, Excellent location near to the City Great friendly service Perfect for the business traveller or for some sightseeing Very clean rooms Plenty of bath amenities that are replaced in due course Rooms are supplied with slippers and bathrobes 
51027,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, nIggly little things newspaper ordered but not delivered order wrong both breakfasts and food service was too long but delicious when it came terrible music in dining breakfast room think small mistakes were due to lack of command of English maybe , facilities in room coffee machine comfort of bed cleanliness Friendliness of Italian girl on front desk tasty food

51034,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, The reception area is quite small for a four star hotel and only one elevator when it broke down we had to use the stairs which made it difficult to reach your room in higher floors , The location is good easy reach to underground stations and tourist attractions staff are very helpful and availability of free wifi 
51035,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Would much preferred to be able to check in before 3 o clock Although due to traffic on the day we arrived a lot later than planned , Our room was on the 6th floor and had a great view of some of the buildings in London The room was well decorated and felt very cosy Room service was spot on and only ever had to wait about 5 minutes for our drinks to arrive Great value for money in a great location 
51036,Hotel Indigo London Tower Hill, Breakfast was reasonable but value for money poor Porridge was milk quality breakfast deviated over the days we were there Bread was hard and not fresh versus good bread The elevator was broken for 2 days our rooms were on floor 5 only an excuse but no compensation, Location is very nice Free minibar
