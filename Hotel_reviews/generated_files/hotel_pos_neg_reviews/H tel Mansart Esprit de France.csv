202215,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, The hotel was too old and the room and the bathroom were not clean The bathroom was too small compared with the room size and uncomfortable I cannot hear the footsteps of the above room and the sound of running water of other rooms , The hotel location was good to access major attractions and metro station 
202216,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Our double room was small but this is an old building in a city and space is at a premium I would upgrade to something larger next time , Excellent location in a wealthy part of town perfect for visiting the city and no concerns about walking around the streets nearby 
202217,H tel Mansart Esprit de France,No Negative, We got amazing offer 50 discount so for the price paid it was priceless great location massive room and bathroom clean and comfortable with some antique furniture 
202218,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Room 304 is only a single room We book a double bedroom named classic cosi room 220 each night It s a nonsense to offer this place like double bedroom The reasons are 1 There isn t space for a double bed the bed cross the room 2 Refrigerator is into the closet there is not closet space 3 Only there is one nightstand There isn t space for the second nightstand 4 Bathroom door open outward and obstruct passage to bed 5 There isn t space where to leave two bags We are very disappointed Sorry about the score impact but all of the above is true, I recognize Everything in the hotel is clean and well presented Excelent Breakfast common areas staff and location 
202219,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Very rude and unhelpful night staff , Great location with easy public parking just around the corner close to Louvre and other sights Nice cosy and comfortable room 
202220,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, The toilet which is is separate from the bathroom is very small and with no hand basin , Excellent Location round the corner is the Place Vendome The hotel is about a 10minute walk from the drop off of the airport shuttle The staff were friendly and helpful The room itself was a good size and the bathroom is fine too 
202221,H tel Mansart Esprit de France,No Negative, The beds were great as parents to 3 young girls we really appreciate things like that The breakfast was one to remember The hotel design was exactly what we like 
202222,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, N a, Didn t have breakfast in the hotel But there are a lot of restaurants boulangeries in the area so we went and ate in some of those restaurants 
202223,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Creaky floors dripping faucets old carpeting narrow corridors uncomfortable bath tubs no showers uncomfortable mattresses creepy breakfast room,No Positive
202224,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Nothing, We were 3 people including our 10 year daughter and were supposed by the manadgement of the hotel to change our room for bigger one for some surcharge and it was a good idea the size of the room was really good for Paris The bed was clean and comfortable The location was perfect it was close to everything
202225,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Can t think of anything , It s like a private town house elegant charming and comfortable The staff are superb Roissy bus from CDG terminates three minutes walk away Perfect central location Looking forward to our third stay later this year 
202226,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, We were sold a family room but it wasn t set up as explained and was missing a bed We had to take an additional room costing 270 a night , Fantastic location amazing staff very beautiful 
202227,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, The room service the food wasn t good way too pricy for what it was and very slow 1h wait , The location was excellent Very charming hotel Nice staff 
202228,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Arrived with lots of bags but no help was offered getting to the room which was a little awkward or even in or out of the hotel entrance , Great location and v comfortable
202229,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, The decor in the bedroom itself was not to our taste but that s just our opinion, The staff were really nice and welcoming In terms of the room the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was really nicely decorated The housekeeping standards were also very high The proximity to the lovely shopping district and restaurants in the 2nd Arondissement was excellent
202230,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Cheaper breakfast, The SriLankan man at the frint desk is fabulously kind The rooms are perfect chic and spacious we did not take the smallest one but the next one in price 
202231,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Absolutely nothing only that we could not stay longer , The hotel is in a great location close to Paris many attractions museums shopping cafes restaurants park etc It has a classic and warm design very French where we felt homely throughout our stay The room was spacious for Paris and spotlessly clean The nespresso machine was a nice little touch which we have appreciated every morning The entire staff was absolutely fantastic went out and beyond to accommodate our every wish and request We were travelling with our dog who was warmly welcomed and got spoiled by staff at every occasion Thank you for the wonderful and memorable stay We will be back 
202232,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Very limited space to keep clothes , Excellent location and very helpful staffs They gave us some advices on restaurants etc Simple but good breakfast and the tea set in the room which was very convenient 
202233,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Our complimentary bottle of water which was left in our room was already opened and half drunk no doubt left from the last guest which bodes ill for attention to detail Also the shower could do with a renovation It was a rather cramped affair , The hotel was charming and the staff was friendly We got there before check in and left our luggage with reception By the time we returned they had already brought out luggage to our room without our having to request it 
202234,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, 1 The coffee and baguette at breakfast were of no interest whatsoever wrong suppliers 2 The hotel badly needs a space for cars to pull up in front to unload luggage and there should be a hall porter to help guests with luggage , Our room a Deluxe Vendome was a dream and the location is as good as it gets 
202235,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, The room was extremely small and freezing cold on arrival It had been sliced in order to make room for the bathroom The quality of the room was good but there wasn t even enough space for luggage which we had to place on the desk , The breakfast was very nice Staff were also very helpful 
202236,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, We had a beautiful shower only to find out we had no bath towels in our room and the reception phone number was no where to be found We awkwardly had to go down to reception and ask for towels where we were treated as if we were lying or stole the towels This is particularly humiliating standing wet in a robe The man also only gave us one bath towel one hand towel which meant two trips to reception to collect another towel They were very apologetic the next day and all other staff were fantastic I hope this was just a one off unfortunate occasion , Beautiful clean spacious and a pleasure
202237,H tel Mansart Esprit de France,No Negative, Amazing hotel The staff was pleasant and friendly the location is perfect the room like a chateau and the beds like sleeping on clouds seriously We travel a lot and this was by far one of the best places we ve stayed 
202238,H tel Mansart Esprit de France,No Negative, Excellent room comfortable bed and pillows Staff very helpful even helped me to book my taxi through Uber which was far cheaper than the normal taxis i didn t eat at the hotel so can t comment on food 
202239,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, The room was cold and the heater wasn t working because it s not the season , The room was clean and cleaning service was good too Very wonderful location nice interior design 
202240,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, It took so long to check in and out Pretty noisy from the streets Old windows Some hairs in the bath room Hair dryer was not an European plug I had to go to the reception to get the right plug with my wet hair , Very good location and a spacious room
202241,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Be aware the outer door closes early for a city centre hotel But instructions in French and English about gaining entry are clear Might have been useful to be told this on arrival , The very convenient location of the hotel and the friendly and helpful staff An oasis of calm in central Paris 
202242,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Only difficulty was reading in bed Poor lighting Floor lamp placed awkwardly in room , Incredibly kind and helpful staff Tall ceilings added elegance to the room Thick walls and windows made it very quiet Nice products in the room 
202243,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, The bathroom is a bit outdated but clean and the complimentary supplies shampoo conditioner and so forth excellent , Excellent location very polite staff Room was very clean and quite big for Paris standards Loved the big closet in the bedroom

202245,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, small room superior very small bathroom low ceilings hard to take shower for my husband 187cm , very central location very nice girls at the reception give us good advises for restaurants
202246,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Room was quite small not a great deal of room to move around but we were only there at night time so it didn t spoil our experience at all , Fab facilities everything we needed Lovely comfy bed very quiet never heard any other guests late at night It was very favourably priced for the location I would definitely stay there again
202247,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Nothing, Central location close to shopping transport sightseeing clean spacious room fast wifi comfortable bed friendly helpful staff heaven after one month travelling 
202248,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, There were NO AVAILABLE PLUGS The only way to charge your cell phone tablet or laptop was the get down on your hands and knees unplug a lamp and charge the devices one at a time This is a very easy fix and the hotel should do it Also the wifi was not working at all well when I was there and I saw a number of guests coming down for help confused and disgruntled Also breakfast at 18 euros is most definitely not worth the money Walk down to a nearby cafe for coffee and croissants or something better , The staff from top to bottom is friendly helpful multilingual and welcoming The rooms on the 5th floor are very quiet despite being in the center of Paris and facing the street The location for touring many of the principal tourist sites is excellent you are a very short walk from the Louvre Palais Royale Comedie Francaise Place de la Concorde Jardins de Tuilleries Opera and just across the bridge from the Musee d Orsay There are three major Metro stops nearby and a taxi stand on the corner This is a very comfortable smaller alternative to the much bigger chain hotels in the area like the Westin or the much pricier ones like the Ritz Carlton a half a block away 
202249,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Room was not comfortable enough The bed was so small for two There was not enough closets to place the clothes Toilet looks very old need renovation , Perfect Location Helpful Staff

202251,H tel Mansart Esprit de France,No Negative, Everything was quite fine with this hotel nothing to complain about The location is perfect this spot is a geometrical center of all sights of interest for tourists so you can easily reach all of them even by foot Metro stations are also not far One drawback might be the lack of supermarkets in the neighbourhood so if you stronlgy need some during your stay this might be a problem The room I was in was relatively small but not smaller than it is usual in this kind of hotels in Paris Everything else was very good the room equipment is perfect cleanless is perfect and the breakfast is very good rich and of high wuality I especially liked the floor heating in the bathroom as well as the high quality of bathroom furniture equipment and showers All my recommendations except for the price that was rather high but still competitive to other similar hotels in Paris 
202252,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Room was small , We loved our stay at Hotel Mansart It was very comfortable and the neighborhood was fabulous The staff was wonderful and so helpful They helped book our dinner reservations for us and also train tickets when we were having trouble Will definitely be back again 
202253,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, wifi could be stronger but regardless the location value for money charm of hotel and staff have all made it now my choice in Paris love you Mansart , Everything about the place was wonderful Nicest staff all of them bellmen and front desk staff all so charming and kind Lovely room extremely tasteful decor and a deeply comfortable bed important for a bad back traveler like myself 
202254,H tel Mansart Esprit de France, Would be great to add more English TV channels, Boutique hotel Located in marvelous area very clean rooms staff are so friendly they are ready to answer any question about Paris sites the hotel manager Mr Samuel is always available to help and listen for any comment you do not have to ask about him he is standing with his colleagues in the reception area it was pleasure to know him I would like to thank Mr Boshka and all reception staff for everything I do recommend this hotel for every one
