188672,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, Great location for Wembley arena Few minutes walk to the shipping outlets and parking available opposite Hotel itself was clean staff were welcoming and the room itself was modern and had everything you require Added bonus was a built in TV in the bathroom Very luxurious and a competitive price Breakfast in the morning was also good value and the quality was good 
188673,St George s Hotel Wembley, Complimentary bottle of wine was caulked Nothing in mini bar Staff unhelpful Room was good but had a hint of cigarette odour Price was double normal rate in excess of 400 for one night excluding breakfast No way is this a 4 star venue ,No Positive
188674,St George s Hotel Wembley, The price was high but the hotel was of good quality The room was not cleaned when we approached the staff without making a fuss we asked for just clean towels it did not matter about the room that was not done neither We paid 573 so therefore we would have expected this do have been done When we told reception about it the next morning I would have expected a small discount as it was a lot of money for nothing , Excellent Location to Wembley Stadium
188675,St George s Hotel Wembley, Restaurant was disappointing with only one server ordered pasta and tasted very strange and spicy and also menu s smelt , room and hotel was clean and modern 
188676,St George s Hotel Wembley, Food prices are rather expensive, I liked how water tea and coffee were provided in the rooms especially as it was such a hot day Also I was very grateful that staff had such hospitality made me feel very welcome 
188677,St George s Hotel Wembley, Air con hardley worked room was really hot parking is not great either, bathroom is really nice and enjoyed haveing a balcony to get fresh air and look over Wembley
188678,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, The twin room we had was wonderful It had a nice size good beds everything very clean and modern quiet the door even has an alarm and the bathroom has a tv that you can watch in the bath It s not close to central London but you can walk through a pedestrianized area from Wembley Park Station that takes you to a shopping mall about 5 minutes from the hotel where there s cafe s and restaurants All in all it takes about 10 minutes or so to go from Wembley Park to the hotel or you can take a bus too Metropolitan takes you to Baker Street in about 15 min and Jubilee does it in about 25 min 
188679,St George s Hotel Wembley, Having to pay 25 per night deposit either by cash or credit card This was refunded on departure once room checked but not aware of this prior to booking ,No Positive
188680,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, We were pleased to see receive a complimentary bottle of wine as we were staying at the hotel to see the Adele concert which was cancelled 24 hours before a nice touch 
188681,St George s Hotel Wembley, Breakfast was poorly organised and very ordinary , The hotel was fine but grossly overpriced due to the Adele concert and it was non refundable I have never spent so much on a hotel before and at nearly 400 each for the night it was extortionate The staff on the reception desk were exceptionally kind as I was really upset It was not a 400 per night room I would not have been there if it wasn t for the concert which was cancelled 
188682,St George s Hotel Wembley, As an event was cancelled last minute the room was not refundable not the hotels fault I know , Room upgrade was nice free bottle of wine 
188683,St George s Hotel Wembley, Price seems to have been hiked excessively solely because there was a concert at Wembley Happy to pay it but didn t realise how much cheaper the room was at other times ,No Positive
188684,St George s Hotel Wembley, the caesar salad wasnt a delight to the eyes the taste was ok but it was more akin to a chicken coleslaw look , the staff went over and above what was expected from them the stadium is a very short walk away our room was large enough to be comfortable all in all a good find 
188685,St George s Hotel Wembley, Parking we had reserved a car park space in advance and despite arriving early there was only 1 space available Facilities for parking is poor and in total there are only approx 4 spaces as other spaces are being used for storage Restaurant was chaotic at times especially at breakfast and needs to be better managed not a great choice at breakfast , The location was ideal for Wembley Arena Staff very pleasant and room very comfortable 
188686,St George s Hotel Wembley, No room service being available due to the hotel being busy following an event at Wembley Stadium The comment we usually do room service but not tonight was not only disappointing but incredibly unhelpful to us , It was very close to Wembley Stadium
188687,St George s Hotel Wembley, Very bad Air Con so room got very hot couldn t open Balcony Door as on a very noisy road which we knew as we wanted to be near Wembley Stadium so we did not get much sleep The breakfast was terrible see our photos of what was supposed to be Scrambled Egg Broccoli for breakfast with Lemon The fact that the room was 3 x that of its normal cost because we went to a concert at Wembley should make the hotel even more determined to give great service and food Don t stay there if you want to sleep in a cool room and have a decent breakfast , Clean Room and nice Towels 
188688,St George s Hotel Wembley, Everything suited us well , Staff were extremely friendly and helpful the visit as a whole was very enjoyable room was great and well serviced hotel location suited us perfectly as we were visiting Wembley Stadium 3 4 min walk for a concert and we also wanted to visit London Designer Outlet which is only two minutes away 
188689,St George s Hotel Wembley, No bathrobes no shower cap not a great selection of toiletries either, Very friendly accommodating staff the restaurant had a decent menu and we were able to have lunch late in the afternoon The room had a large TV USB and overseas plug sockets plenty of pillows and cushions The air conditioning worked and the room was quiet even though it was a busy Saturday night Excellent choice of breakfast food 
188690,St George s Hotel Wembley, More natural light in the room and easier car spaces to park in , Room had adjustable temperature and fan speed also adjustable lighting Nice clean room and bathroom Staff were lovely 
188691,St George s Hotel Wembley, Didn t appreciate being woken up by reception at 23 55 to be told a taxi which we hadn t ordered was waiting for us We were woken again at 08 50hrs on a Sunday morning by a maid wanting to clean the room check out wasn t until 11am Hairdrier not working in room , well placed for Wembley stadium Good selection at breakfast Lovely balcony on room 
188692,St George s Hotel Wembley, Food I am afraid Found the evening meal a little bland and too oily Cooked breakfast wasn t very hot , Room was excellent clean modern Very nice
188693,St George s Hotel Wembley, Location is quite far from London centre and public transport zone 4 is not cheap However a hotel of this category in the centre would be at least double price Breakfast is too basic , The room was very modern clean and confortable Very close to Design District very nice shopping and reasonable food 
188694,St George s Hotel Wembley, Bed was not properly made the matress topper wasnt put on n the sheet was just over the bed there were small stains on the sheet 2single beds were pushed together rather than getting an actual doube bed and it wasnt very comfortable atall scatter cushions n throw for bed had visible stains and the shower had dirt on the floor n hadnt been cleaned for 131 00 i would expect better cleaning n comfort wise , Lovely looking place nice solid wood around room decent bathroom aircon 
188695,St George s Hotel Wembley, The cost but I guess it was on an event day so that should probably be expected The car park was full so 35 to park in the nearby Holiday Inn was unfortunate , The two chaps on reception were extra friendly efficient and helpful Great room excellent bathroom Really good and well priced restaurant too 
188696,St George s Hotel Wembley, Manager was very rude to me over the phone and hung up on me also booking com customer services very rude won t be booking again with booking com, Comfy bed Also lovely bath with tv in the bath I even fell asleep in the bath so relaxing 
188697,St George s Hotel Wembley, I didn t like the fact a hot buffet breakfast or cook to order wasn t included in the price of the stay Staff were very stiff and wooden at breakfast time there was no offer to get us drinks offer us a menu or even make us feel welcome Not good when you pay 284 per night The room service cut off was rediculous and there was no way you d get anything after the cut of time not good when you return 10 mins after there cut of point I am due to stay here in December again for a Gig and theprice is 130 quid so I may well cancel as I wasn t impressed by the food situation , Excellent choice however the prices had been significantly bumped up as we were seeing the stone roses The bath had a TV in which I guess is a bonus lol Lovely touches such as wine l biscuits and chocolates on arrival 
188698,St George s Hotel Wembley, No negatives against the hotel whatsoever If you are travelling by train just be prepared for the 10 minute walk from Wembley Park Station but you can always jump on the bus , We only had a one night stay at St George s for a concert at Wembley Stadium which is literally on the doorstep I m only sorry that we didn t get to stay longer The room was fantastic clean spacious and comfortable We ate in the La Regina restaurant for our evening meal and breakfast both meals were delicious Staff were friendly and helpful We would highly recommend this hotel and would most definitely stay again if we are ever in the area 
188699,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, It was not easy to find the hotel using Sat nav as it took us up the side street for the car park which was not sign posted however we called the hotel and the receptionist directed us to the hotel Great hotel superb location for Wembley too Very clea and would highly recommend it and we will use it again
188700,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, Our room was lovely until the toilet broke it constantly flushed itself we reported the problem to staff who basically told us there was nothing they could do Once we d fallen asleep a board containing electricals dropped causing a loud bang exposing plugs belonging to the TV hairdryer etc which in turn woke us up and to top it off the milk for the complimentary coffee tea was rotten We eventually managed to change rooms we had no problems as all in the second room 
188701,St George s Hotel Wembley, The breakfast was very poor even for a continental breakfast I would expect more choice Staff didn t replace anything that had run out unless you asked and were not friendly at all , Comfortable bed lovely bathroom with TV Fridge was also very handy 
188702,St George s Hotel Wembley, The staff are not professionally trained as a staff opened my room without knocking in the very early morning The facility looks new however the door in my room was too rusted to open so I was locked and could not open the door inside the room fortunately got help from the staff in the end The towels are not clean as they were badly stained not sure if they changed it from previous occupants The aircon produced hot air not cold and it was noisy all night through Probably the worst experience I ve ever had Stay away from this hotel , The room is spacious
188703,St George s Hotel Wembley, Check out was not great I found the person behind the desk a little rude answering the phone to several people as i m trying to check out also having a conversation with me about the car parking used I don t actually have a licence at all Maybe more staff are needed upon check out on busy weekends to avoid problems stress I also thought the room had a smoke smell to it the whole hotel is non smoking it wasn t a problem but could have been a issue for some Things like this made me think twice about the value for money side of things 2 nights cost me 415 in total Hotel bar informed us of warm beer ahead of buying drinks at lunchtime not sure why this was the case , Decent location small hotel so not loads of noise and I stayed on a busy weekend Staff at check in very helpful polite Breakfast was nice Bed was nice bathroom was large 
188704,St George s Hotel Wembley, Breakfast was too basic for the price , The rooms were lovely and spacious TV in the bath lovely restaurant and perfect location if going Wembley Stadium

188707,St George s Hotel Wembley, I have nothing bad to say , The room and the location were great The bathroom with the tv and rain shower was a nice touch plus the view from the room 
188708,St George s Hotel Wembley, After the match at Wembley the hotel was locked as it was full and we had to bang on the door to get in as we had a room, Very nice rooms and fantastic location if visiting Wembley stadium
188709,St George s Hotel Wembley, A selection of pillow sizes would have been good , Beautifully presented room Touch lighting was great TV in the bathroom was very quirky Really comfy bed Staff couldn t have done more to be helpful provide all assistance It s very convenient to Wembley Park area for gigs shopping Mall
188710,St George s Hotel Wembley, We had to call reception as the door mechanism was very stiff and we thought we were stuck in the room The hotel did offer to move us to another room , The bathroom was super modern and the shower was divine Comfy beds and modern dimming lighting Breakfast was pleasant all the staff friendly and helpful Great location for events at Wembley 
188711,St George s Hotel Wembley, Breakfast was rubbish Coffee machine empty no juice no bowls to put the cereal in no egg cups for the boiled eggs And those croissants were clearly barely heated up frozen ones Definitely give the breakfast a miss , Room itself was good and spacious
188712,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, Clean comfortable beds no noise from outside but unfortunately a herd of elephants in the room above around 1 2am Plenty of choice on the continental breakfast buffet and the staff all very helpful and friendly I thought the car park charge was a bit much 25 for a piece of spare space at the back but it was well secured Close to Wembley Arena which was the reason for our visit However the disabled wet room had a couple of minuses the shower floor should have had a rougher surface and I nearly slipped shower controls needed indication of what each was for as I got the full force on my head at one point and that was freezing Could have supplied a shower cap Disabled toilet pedestals are normally higher than provided there was no holder for toilet roll 
188713,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, The hotel is conveniently located to Wembley and Brent Civic centre the room was large you could definitely swing more than one cat There is a small fridge ideal for storing food items the free bottled water is placed in here so lovely and cold on a hot day Staff were lovely including the hotel cleaning staff their English may not be brilliant but their service and attitude definitely is

188719,St George s Hotel Wembley, Nothing Everything exceeded our expectations and we had the best time , Me and my boyfriend were lucky enough to get a room on the back side of the building so we didn t have to worry about the noise from the main road and as a bonus we got a lovely view The room itself was very modern and had a very clean finish the bed was extremely comfortable

188722,St George s Hotel Wembley, Breakfast and being overcharged, Lovely clean modern Hotel with onsite parking charged at 10 per day and restaurant Restaurant menu is reasonably priced food is perfectly acceptable but nothing to rave about Friendly staff I ordered eggs benedict for breakfast priced at 6 on the menu but for some reason I was charged 12 50 price for full english and continental breakfast I couldn t eat the breakfast anyway as the poached eggs were hard the hollandaise sauce was more like cheese sauce it came with parma ham which was fatty and stringy and was served like a sandwich with half a muffin on bottom and half on top so I was charged more than double for something I didn t eat Waiter disappeared after bringing my breakfast so couldn t complain
188723,St George s Hotel Wembley, Regina restaurant where you have breakfast and can have Italian food isn t really seperated and is open plan to the foyer Breakfast is served here continental which was included was adequate we upgraded to a full English which was absolutely awful and I left mine hard fried eggs beans in a seperated bowl but was swimming in grease bad quality sausages and bacon BUT the restaurant is good value both food and drinks considering your in London and the busyness reflected this We booked the restaurant for an evening meal prior to arriving based on the website thinking it was abit special but was badly let down again good value and ok food but I wanted it to be a special meal for my husband and myself , The room was excellent free extras wine water coffee tea biscuits chocolates big room great bathroom with tv in the bath Staff were very good polite and courteous Walking distant to Wembley Stadium which was great for us 
188724,St George s Hotel Wembley, We went to the boxing at Wembley after the fight we went back to the hotel to have a drink When we got there the hotel was full of NONE guests drinking in the bar it was over crowded and we couldn t get a drink so we went to our rooms to order some only to be told there to busy to offer us room service there was also fights breaking out amongst none residents in the bar, Location and standard of rooms

188728,St George s Hotel Wembley, Only thing to keep in mind is that the windows of the standard rooms at the back cannot be opened If you like fresh air then this can be a draw back You ll depend on the air conditioning for the temperature control in your room , The hotel is located at a 20 minute walk from Wembley Park tube station The walk from the station is pleasant and safe The rooms are spacious for London standards They are tastefully decorated and the bathrooms are state of the art Sound proofing is excellent and assures quiet and restful nights The wifi connection free of charge was fast and efficient Check in was quick and painless accompanied by friendly smiles from the staff 
188729,St George s Hotel Wembley, Breakfast was good But the hotel should consider to double the service staff at least I m the weekend and or peak hours One person is not able to manage it allone , Very friendly staff Answering patiently all questions Even preparing a birthday cake and a decoration of the room on request The room is very clean new and modern A paid car park in the backyard 
188730,St George s Hotel Wembley, For the week we ve been there you couldnt change the Air conditionner from your room not even turn it off you have to call the reception to change the air conditionner We had a problem in our bathroom couldnt change the water temperature We complained 5 times the problem has never been addressed and they never offered us another room We took mildly cold shower for 1 week Average location 12 minutes walking from all metro stations Breakfast quite poor for the price The products are bad quality and few choice, Very sympathetic receptionists they love their job Wonderful finishing quality of the lights and decoration in the room 
188731,St George s Hotel Wembley, I just didn t like the Room I got cause there was not doors to open to get fresh air in the room and also I have no view of outside just a side window which I was just looking at the side build that room was 508 on the 5th floor , I love how friendly and polite the staff that deal with me were and also the bed was very comfortable and just how I like it the place was very clean and fresh i have been there many times and will not stop coming to that hotel on a scale of 10 I would give a score of 9 I enjoyed my stay

188742,St George s Hotel Wembley, The only issue is that it got cold at night as the air con stopped so I woke from this and had to turn it back to a warmer temp but that s the only downside throughout the stay , The TV in the bath tub was a nice touch the the already amazing bathroom Beds are really comfortable The TV is a generous size and connectivity to it is nice and easy along with other connection options like bluetooth and 3 5mm headphone jack are a good touch The location is great if you plan on going to a game at Wembley of just fancy a shopping trip with the outlet mall near by But parking is limited and it s a first come first served basis as they have limited spaces at a fair charge We all enjoyed out time at this prestigious hotel without being over priced and the staff are very friendly

188773,St George s Hotel Wembley, We had some trouble with the electronic key card to access the room We had to get the card scanned about 3 times to try to get it to work In the end they gave us the manual key to use I realise this isn t a huge negative but when you d driven 5 1 2 hours to get there it s not ideal Having to go back and fourth to the desk The staff were very helpful though Also the room smelled of smoke when we walked in despite it being a no smoking room , The room was very spacious and the facilities are very hi tech and modern

188778,St George s Hotel Wembley, Absolutely nothing it was perfect, Absolutely amazing we turned up before 12 with check in at 3 we were expecting to just drop our bags off and then go out but the receptionist couldn t have been more helpful she checked if the room was ready as we were so early it wasn t but she upgraded us to a superior room and let us check in early the room was absolutely amazing and heated bathroom floors which were hot enough to dry wet socks on one of the best hotels I ve ever stopped in 
188779,St George s Hotel Wembley, 10 to 15 minutes walking to undergrand station Poor wifi , Friendly staff thanks for Ana and Anderia Modern room and bathroom 2 minutes to designer outlet with alot of shopping and dinning I will visit this hotel again 
188780,St George s Hotel Wembley, Car parking is limited and was full when I arrived advise booking ahead Restaurant could expand menu a little, Comfortable well appointed rooms Automatic lighting control and aircon in bedroom and bathroom meant relaxing atmosphere The TV in the bath was a bonus feature 
188781,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, It was an ok stay London is expensive and this location certainly was not the best for my purpose But I can see the appeal if you are interested in Wembley events
188782,St George s Hotel Wembley, Although it was great to have Wembly Stadium as our balcony view we found the traffic noise a little intrusive especially early in the mornings The glass appeared to be double glazed but it sounded like a window was open all the time The room that we had was quite small There was only room for 1 chair so you had to sit on the bed , Very pleasant and helpful staff nothing was too much trouble The whole hotel was spotlessly clean and inviting and the bed was so comfy The restaurant was great and the food was reasonably priced and delicious too Really enjoyed watching tv whilst relaxing in the bath very indulgent The bus stopped right outside the hotel and the tube was a 5 min stroll away We would be extremely happy to return to this hotel and to recommend it to friends family and you too 
188783,St George s Hotel Wembley, Breakfast was little bit simple but everyrhing else was excellent, Staff was kindly and the room was perfect The hotel location is very close to Wembley stadium 
188784,St George s Hotel Wembley, Prior to my stay I had stayed in st George s hotel and my room had heated flooring During my stay recently I realised that it didn t which was disappointing , Bed was very comfortable
188785,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, The room was beautiful and extremely cosey Staff were brilliant The hotel is 2 mins away from the London Designer Outlet which is great for shopping eating etc Will definitely be staying here again 
188786,St George s Hotel Wembley, Nothing no complaints at all , Got a beautiful new room everything up to date Staff very friendly and an excellent location for Wembley Arena Had a room onto a side street so no view but very quiet Can t comment on food as we didn t eat there 
188787,St George s Hotel Wembley, I was a little disappointed that the bar was closed on our return to the hotel around 11pm and again the restaurant was closed the following day when we checked out we had hoped to grab a coffee and a quick bite to eat before leaving , This hotel was a little more expensive than our usual picks however the room was lovely very modern and clean The bed was very comfortable and the TV in the bath was just amazing The staff were friendly and helpful The hotel was handy for us as it is only a short walk from Wembley arena and we were visiting London for a concert 
188788,St George s Hotel Wembley, Wasnt prompted about free wifi if it was available but that didnt bothor me too much, Location was perfect Room was exceptional Not too big or small very intimate Beautiful bathroom and tv in bath was a extra perk
188789,St George s Hotel Wembley, There was a slight old mop smell on the lobby corridor , Very unassuming building small and out of the way however got a very nice view from our room got the executive double room Staff were friendly when I called to request champagne flutes and gave us complementary free late check out despite us giving only about 10 minutes notice The Italian restaurant inside the hotel is quite nice as well quite a nice little surprise 
188790,St George s Hotel Wembley, The only thing that runined a little bit of my night was that our room was next to the car park so it can get noisy when busy , I enjoyed the politeness of all staff I interacted with The rooms were very spacious and clean and look Excatly like the management photos Although I only stayed a night I will surely exten my stay in the future 
188791,St George s Hotel Wembley, The breakfast was dire Cheap ham slices cut in half a bit of salami and cold eggs The toaster took forever and only did one side at a time No selection no quality whatsoever and no service whatsoever Shame as the hotel is very smart , Lovely hotel Very stylish and a spacious room which had all mod cons 
188792,St George s Hotel Wembley, We were put in a room with just a shower at first however we rang reception and asked to be moved to a room with a bath and it wasn t a problem Also parking in the hotel you have to reserve and it s 25 but the holiday inn opposite allow you to park and its 10 per night in a secure car park , Room was lovely and bed was was really comfy had the best sleep and we felt like there was enough food for breakfast so didn t feel the need to upgrade Tube station 10 min walk so easy access to the centre Designer shopping outlet opposite hotel didn t have many shops 
188793,St George s Hotel Wembley, Not so much didn t like but worth noting that there is limited parking at the hotel which you need to book in advance I wasn t aware of this I parked in The Holiday Inn over the road and walked over which wasn t an issue but maybe could be better highlighted when booking , The hotel was a real surprise very modern and clean all staff I met were extremely helpful and professional Had a great night sleep and was very reasonably priced I don t often head into the restaurant when I m on my own but I did on this visit The food was very good quality and I felt didn t feel in comfortable at all I will definitely stay here again when I need to stay over in Wembley 
188794,St George s Hotel Wembley, The bed was not very soft and quite solid so not a lot of sleep but it was such a lovely room and hotel in total, The staff were amazing and so friendly and even gave me and my partner a free upgrade to a massive luxury suite xx
188795,St George s Hotel Wembley, The room maid kept entering the room despite the sleeping sign on outside the door which woke me up twice , The customer service upon arrival from Ana was amazing and was offered a room upgrade which was nice The hotel is in a great location with links into central london in less than 10 minutes Very clean

188797,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, Helpful staff Cozy hotel Very good connectivity Plenty of charging outlets in room 3 of which were USB outlets TV built in the wall by the bathtub 
188798,St George s Hotel Wembley, We got back to the hotel at 11 and the bar was already shut so had to go out again Would be nice to have a nightcap before going to bed , Location was great Room was very nice Only complaint was the bath plug didn t hold the water Very comfortable with friendly staff 
188799,St George s Hotel Wembley, Wifi was not working the whole stay The reception staff was friendly but lack information about simple touristic attraction and major events like the world travel market, Food in the restaurant was great
188800,St George s Hotel Wembley, The only problem with the touchscreen system was that after approximately 30 minutes the lights and tv went off This was annoying and happened while I was taking a bath I had to get out anc put them back on If I m in the room the lights should stay on until I turn them off or leave the room , The bed was very comfortable the touchscreen system for lights and other amenities was excellent apart from one small problem Friendly staff good location for using the SSE 
188801,St George s Hotel Wembley, Extremely small room with a view of dingy back gardens of neighbouring houses and the car park through a 6 wide window At 180 plus 25 for parking it was expensive breakfast costs extra Food in restaurant was just ok had to wait a long time for a pizza and when it arrived didn t have the chilli that i requested and was basically just a hard flatbread pizza with a few vegetables scattered haphazardly on top leaving a lot of the pizza as just plain cheese , Soft and comfortable bed lovely bathroom and great location for wembley arena 
188802,St George s Hotel Wembley, Cooked breakfast was cold and very mediocre for such an expensive hotel, Location is perfect if you re there for a Wembley event 3 4 minute walk if that 
188803,St George s Hotel Wembley, Bar restaurant not owned by hotel so not open when we returned from event Staff recommended hotel across the road which was fine though Disappointed that the price for the next time we would like to be there is over 600 for a room Obviously due to the event but ridiculous so have gone elsewhere , Really comfortable bed in a room with all mod cons Excellent sound proofing ensured a good night sleep Very friendly staff providing efficient service Excellent location for Wembley events 
188804,St George s Hotel Wembley, The mattress was a little too soft for my liking and pillows too hard for my liking but husband liked both , The staff where so friendly the restaurant was lovely And the rooms were clean and huge We stayed in a superior room with view Walking distance to Wembley 
188805,St George s Hotel Wembley, The bed was slightly on the hard side , We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights From the moment we arrived Anna the receptionist was brilliant We were upgraded to a superior room Check in was very efficient We needed parking for an extra day as we wanted to go sightseeing Anna sorted this out when we checked in Anna made me feel looked after and as a first point of contact was an excellent representation for the hotel I would definitely stay here again Room was spacious and clean The TV in the bathroom was so good to relax We had a cooked breakfast which was really nice 
188806,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, Really loved the different sizes of cushions My first brilliant night s sleep outside of my own bedroom in years My husband loved the shaving mirror He ordered one on our return 
188807,St George s Hotel Wembley, Nothing, We visited last year and enjoyed our stay so much that we decided to book the hotel again this year for our pre Christmas visit The staff were very helpful and even changed one of our rooms so we all had a bath with the TV in the bath We did not have breakfast at the hotel as we found that a bit too pricey but there are plenty of restaurants and cafes in the designer outlet across the road 
188808,St George s Hotel Wembley, The noise above my room 509 and poor service for breakfast had to get tea and food else where No manager on site to take any complaints and nothing was done to help , Close to stadium
188809,St George s Hotel Wembley, The full english breakfast we had was awful My dog would have left that im glad we didnt eat in the resturant Minus 10 for the food , The staff were very polite and helpful The decor was good and overall the hotel was clean 
188810,St George s Hotel Wembley, Parking limited and cramped also a bug bear having to pay extra however it seems to be more the norm now in London, Contemporary well presented room which exceeded expectations proper comfy bed and shower was wicked and loved the tv built in to the wall in the bathroom only thing missing was company 
188811,St George s Hotel Wembley, Temperature of the room wouldn t turn down No air con Spent the night very hot Wasn t the only one Another room had same problem Didn t think reception could do much at midnight though So stuck it out Also would be nice if I had options on my breakfast instead of get what you get attitude 6 beans on a mini plate and runny eggs not my thing , I liked the room with its touch button lighting and the little touches of the tv in the bath Very clean
188812,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, All staff were professional and extremely friendly The room was large clean and modern Loved the TV in the bathroom bit of a luxury but nice Travelled to the O2 to watch the tennis Access was really easy via the tube Evening food in the restaurant was of good quality as was the breakfast Great hotel will stay again each time I visit London
188813,St George s Hotel Wembley, Missing hair dryer in the bathroom noise from outside traffic , Exceptional room I was impressed by facilities design cleaning and not least the bed was very comfortable 
188814,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful the rooms were extremely clean and luxurious with nice gadgets to top it off such as the waterproof TV in the bathroom This hotel is clean and classy just like the pictures online Very nice experience 
188815,St George s Hotel Wembley, Nothing Had a view of the car park on level one would have like a better view But it s not always possible , Greeted by lovely staff room was amazing Bed was super comfy Rooms are very modern Mood lighting which was nice 
188816,St George s Hotel Wembley, Wembley is Wembley but I have stayed at most of the hotels in this area and this one is my favourite so far Sorry but it is hard to pick fault other than to say it is an inner city hotel with limited parking on site You can park over the road , Sometimes you go to a restaurant or hotel and the team working their just make it look easy From the welcome at reception and the efficient service in the restaurant to meeting the chambermaid when I was leaving everyone looked engaged knowledgeable about their product and as though they wanted to be there This is my favourite type of place as I can tell that the team are well lead be at decent GM and company Finally when I checked out the reception team were genuinely interested in my experience during my stay The room was spotless the AV equipment all worked and the TV in the bath was a nice touch My experience in the restaurant was limited to a couple of house reds very well chosen as a house wine and reasonably priced nice glassware the food that I had was simply and squid side as I had eaten earlier on but it was well presented and cooked perfectly I will stay again 
188817,St George s Hotel Wembley, Should have asked for a full breakfast , Fantastically clean modern tidy welcoming quality hotel and with very very polite staff Very welcoming full of Glaswegians on arrival who were fantastic company 
188818,St George s Hotel Wembley, As you would expect price for a stay on the night of event was more than a night with a no event , Great location for wembley Easy to find with freinfly helpful staff snd very clean
188819,St George s Hotel Wembley, I regret that we did not extend our stay there It was among my wife s favorite hotels during our first but certainly not our last trip to England , What did we like Let s start with the proximity to the metro station From there it was a very pleasant 10 minute walk to the hotel We arrived much earlier than check in time However they checked to determine if a room was available There was Our room 306 provided an excellent view of Wembley stadium and of the street below The colors used in decorating the room the layout of the room and the amenities were all upscale Everything in the room was an experience The touch light dimmers and air conditioning heat The heated bathroom floors The rain shower The recessed TV in the tub The thick padding underneath the carpet And less I forget my first traditional English breakfast at the restaurant on site was delicious Finally the staff was engaging helpful informing and humorous My apologies in failing to get your names 
188820,St George s Hotel Wembley, The room was overpriced even for an event weekend The restaurant food was of average quality Room for improvement there Advice on how to park before arrival would help as it is rather complicated , Short stroll to our National Stadium The staff in the hotel and restaurant were top class The room was very comfortable and parking a bonus 
188821,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and the hotel was modern yet still comfy It was good value and in a really central place near two train stations and the London designer outlet shops I would definitely stay again 
188822,St George s Hotel Wembley, That I could only stay one night, Ideally located for Wembley Stadium station which is few minutes into Paddington Bargain price for luxury and disability standards
188823,St George s Hotel Wembley, The bed was 2 beds pushed together you would expect a proper double bed in a luxury hotel Although the first member of staff was friendly she messed up our room booking overcharged us and said we had breakfast when we didn t The next day the male receptionist was very rude said it was our mistake which it Wasn t We had rung the night before and been told check out was 12 he rang at half 11 and told us check out was 11 I explained we had been told 12 and he said well it s 11 No apologies for any of there mistakes The actual room was very nice although I don t think it was upgraded as we were told but I feel the mistakes made ruined it , The room was very modern and perfect location for Wembley arena
188824,St George s Hotel Wembley, Apart from the fact that the prices were double the usual rate due to it being a match day the air con didn t work the remote for the bathroom TV didn t work the safe was already locked on arrival and there was no ironing board I didn t have time to complain as I had a football match to rush off to However when I politely reported this at checkout the guy at reception was unsympathetic and didn t offer an apology Just said casually that he would mention it to his superior If I wasn t running late for work I probably would have put him straight Still very unprofessional and rude on his part which unfortunately reflects badly on the hotel , Very close to Wembley stadium Comfortable clean excellent bathroom and big TV 
188825,St George s Hotel Wembley, The double bed was 2 single beds put together so was sometimes uncomfortable, Tudor Vechiu the Front Office Manager was very welcoming on arrival It added the extra special touch to our stay as he was personable and it felt like he was getting to know us as guests He was accommodating at check in and the process was extremely efficient Both the bedroom and bathrooms were very modern and clean The TV was a large screen which was great as it was enjoyable being able to watch TV in a hotel properly The shower was amazing the best I ve experienced in London the water pressure from the shower head was perfect such an important factor I would definitely stay here again 
188826,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, Great location for Wembley stadium and arena just a few mins walk and also right near to Wembley Central train station and Wembley Park shopping outlet with lots of choice of restaurants and shops The staff are very polite and friendly and helpful with directions and travel information They provided an ice bucket and bottle opener on request The rooms are luxurious and spacious great value for money with lighting and temperature controls on both sides of the huge double bed The bathroom has a TV and optional dimmed lighting which was very relaxing in the bath There s a fridge in the room which was handy and the tele had a good selection of channels so we were never bored You can also just see the stadium out of the window too I ve stayed here twice now and will certainly be staying again in the future Highly recommended 
188827,St George s Hotel Wembley, Would have liked to have been able to check in earlier than the prescribed check in time 15 00 in order to drop our bags and get changed after traveling up to London on the morning , Proximity to Wembley Arena c 5 min walk and Wembley Park Underground Station c 10 min walk Clean well equipped rooms with great shower and comfortable beds 
188828,St George s Hotel Wembley, Bed was very firm Pastries overcooked , Television in the bathroom talk about perfect relaxing in the tub Control of the airconditioning Light controls and balcony 
188829,St George s Hotel Wembley, The dimmer lights kept coming on the first night I was in the hotel and I kept waking up causing me to be half asleep at the conference I was attending , Nice big comfortable bed TV in bathroom Staff were very friendly 
188830,St George s Hotel Wembley, The staff was the most disappointing part of the trip They could have been friendlier and more helpful So if you don t plan on having any issues go ahead and stay here however when soothing does come up get ready to wait around for about an hour while someone finds a solution We had about three issues one at check in that took the longest By the third I did not care anymore and just wanted checkout and watch to ensure there was no extra charges on my account because I would dispute them there was none but still kept that eye out , The room was a ten clean and nice what I am use to for an American hotel The location is far away from the city center i e costing more to use the metro to get around Also about a 20 minute walk from the main station to the hotel If you plan on going to a game at the Wembley stadium and that is the main part of your trip then it is a great location This hotel is right across the street but there is no crosswalk close by so get ready to play life size Frogger 
188831,St George s Hotel Wembley, Only got 2 towels that were the size of hand towels Had to use bath matt as hand towel, The bedroom was great Very cozy and easy to use the appliances
188832,St George s Hotel Wembley, More biscuits but who doesn t lol, It was a one night stop for the arena and if at another gig I wouldn t hesitate to come go to St George again 
188833,St George s Hotel Wembley, Waiters English poor but not major issue just couldn t chat with, Bed was very comfortable slept well Room very quite considering location Easy to book in and I pre booked the parking space Will use again Highly recommended
188834,St George s Hotel Wembley, The hotel is situated on a main street and the restaurant is at the front where there are bus stops Which meant people were right outside the window when you were eating Although there are filters on the windows and to some extent window coverings it would be better not to have the bus stops where they are However I am sure this is not the fault of the Hotel but the local authority , Friendly and helpful staff Nothing was too much trouble The room was quiet and very comfortable modern and everything was working properly The beds extremely comfortable 
188835,St George s Hotel Wembley, Room was on street side and you could hear traffic clearly Better double glazing needed to keep noise out Would ask for room out the back next time , Staff very helpful room comfy good location for Wembley 
188836,St George s Hotel Wembley, Nothing, We had a little hiccup on booking in as I forgot to print confirmation but after that it was easily the best hotel we have found so far on booking com the room was absolutely spotless and the staff amazing the food in Regina Italian restaurant outstanding along with the service The breakfast is a must very reasonable prices would definitely book again
188837,St George s Hotel Wembley, The area was far from the centre so ended travelling a lot but was worth it for what we got , The updated bathroom was amazing and the whole room was very up to date A lovely hotel 
188838,St George s Hotel Wembley, There are only 13 parking spaces which need to be booked in advance We did not realise this when booking and because it was an event day we ended up paying 54 00 for 21 22 hours parking in a local car park , Comfortable room friendly staff in a good location for the arena stadium and designer outlet The TV in the bathroom and touch mood lighting was a big plus
188839,St George s Hotel Wembley, NO soap in bathroom and empty fridge, We went to a concert at see arena so this hotel was very close The hotel is new so all very clean and sparkly The restaurant food and breakfast was very good 
188840,St George s Hotel Wembley, Absolutely nothing about the hotel conditions or staf The location was just a bit too far away from the center it was still doable for our 3 nights stay , Everything The room was huge the bathroom huge Incredibly clean The water was always the perfect temperature the tv in the bathroom also helped Everything worked perfectly The staff were always nice and helpful There was literaly no thing that I didn t like about the hotel
188841,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, Was debating between this hotel and the Hilton However I m so glad I chose to go here The room was amazing and full of comfort Very modern yet classy I will most certainly be returning 
188842,St George s Hotel Wembley, booking arrangement via booking com, Very friendly staff they couldn t help more A little upset with booking via booking com Booked no deposit to receive a phonecall saying I needed t pay one Most comfy hotel bed I have ever stayed on 
188843,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, The room was very comfortable and clean good breakfast very firendly and helpful staff Very nice and well maintained hotel Good location a shopping center nearby 
188844,St George s Hotel Wembley, No Croissants available at breakfast at the time of my stay air conditioning unit even though turned off kept me wake all night, Great location excellent staff superb rooms 
188845,St George s Hotel Wembley, Parking would be an issue unless you pre book a parking space which thankfully we did, The Hotel is great clean and fresh and the staff are very nice excellent location
188846,St George s Hotel Wembley, Bar closed way too early Would have been nice to get a drink after 11pm , Bedrooms very modern and stylish spotlessly clean and comfortable Great shower Large tv built into the wall was a great extra too Within 5 minutes walking distance of the designer outlet resturants cinema Wembley Stadium and the SSE Airtricity Arena Tube station only a 10 min walk also 
188847,St George s Hotel Wembley, The full English breakfast was not GBP 5 as advertised which leads a person to believe a continental breakfast is included it s not The continental is 7 50 and the full English is nearly GBP 10 , The presentation of the hotel was great 
188848,St George s Hotel Wembley, I think having 2 single beds in a deluxe room pushed together so there is a big crack down the middle is not too good Also having to pay a supplement for a cooked breakfast The pillar by the side of the bed was not very clever when walking around in the dark , Staff were pretty friendly and food in the restaurant at night was really good The shower was also really good 
188849,St George s Hotel Wembley, Needs to be clearer that parking should be booked and is very limited Wifi was a bit temperamental Lovely stay though I d definitely go again , Lovely modern decor luxurious at a great price Perfect location Everything you could want 
188850,St George s Hotel Wembley, I did not like that I could not open the window and it was very far from the city center It was a challengr to reach from the airport , The room was very clean and nice I even had a relax tv in the bath The bed was very comfortable 
188851,St George s Hotel Wembley, It s really early to check out There is no one help me to take my bagges from the car to my room and the opposit, It s fantastic location and value of money
188852,St George s Hotel Wembley, Expensive can t compete with the Hilton which offers more luxury at a lower price , Rooms equipped with high quality furnishings tv etc modern styling wifi as standard 
188853,St George s Hotel Wembley, Continental breakfast would be improved with fresh pastries and greater selection of fresh fruit, The rooms in this hotel are worthy of one much more expensive and the staff are always welcoming polite and helpful
188854,St George s Hotel Wembley, Hotel have a bizarre policy about swiping same card room was booked and PREPAID with I did not bring that card with me but could produce ID to prove it was mine but very inflexible and I had to have that card refunded and pay again with another card so I am still waiting for my refund to hit my account which means currently I have paid DOUBLE for my room Hotel ignored my email about it being my boyfriend s birthday the next day and then when they found out told me infront of him I should ve let them know and even once they found out they still did nothing about it Rooms looked empty only one chair at the desk even when there are two of you and nothing else to sit on apart from a bed Very inconvinient , The rooms were very quiet and a nice size 
188855,St George s Hotel Wembley, Paying 25 to park your car inside a private hotel car park designed only for hotel guests is insane , The bathroom was finished to a high standard The locations is great 
188856,St George s Hotel Wembley, There is limited parking on site and they charge per night Sadly our last night we were locked out of our room as the card system had failed and the receptionist had no idea what to do other than offer us an alternate room to sleep in for the night All our luggage and belongings were stuck in our original room so this was extremely inconvenient and frustrating We have since emailed through our complaint and called up and yet had no correspondence from the hotel manager terrible customer service and not what you would expect from a new business considering the price that we paid , Staff were helpful hotel rooms were spotless modern and comfortable 
188857,St George s Hotel Wembley, I didn t like the fact that on booking com when I booked the room it s said all breakfast is included however when I got to the hotel the waitress said that the breakfast included was only continental For the price paid I thought the breakfast including English breakfast would be included i wasn t happy about that, The customer service was amazing
188858,St George s Hotel Wembley, although there was a control for air condition I had to call reception to set it for us cause the air conditioner was not working properly , It was clean
188859,St George s Hotel Wembley, At the time of booking we did include the time of our arrival for 1pm We arrived shortly after 1 and was told our room wasnt ready which wasnt ideal as we had a short break and the hotel itself is located outside london abt half an hr Fortunately we ate lunch in the hotel resturant and the room was ready when we were finished so we could check in then, The rooms were very clean fresh and comfortable really nice rooms Breakfasts and also had some lunch in the resturant all which was lovely and the waitresses were very friendly
188860,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, We had a great stay from the start We got a lovely welcome at reception and our room was cosy and clean I would recommend this hotel especially if your going to a concert at Wembley stadium 20 minutes on the tube to Euston 
188861,St George s Hotel Wembley, On booking com the hotel was selected based on a complimentary breakfast being served This was not the case Breakfast was at a cost of 7 10 pounds , The room was super clean and comfortable Complimentary water in fridge was great Very good coffee in room was a plus The staff were all so accommodating and friendly Special mention to Isaac and Anna The dining room was clean and service was excellent Meal was great 
188862,St George s Hotel Wembley, Located further away from stations than expected As for the hotel Air con wasn t working and we had issues with not being able to lock the room , Room was overall good value but only as we got it at a discounted rate 
188863,St George s Hotel Wembley, Nothing really couldn t really fault any of our trip, Our bed was so comfortable I even got to watch tv in the bath The room was cleaned every day I asked for ironing facilities after being in room for only five minutes and we got them within less than a minute and got told to just keep a hold of them for our stay Great thank you We had breakfast included and it started us off every morning Lovely English breakfast cooked very well The staff in hotel were polite and very friendly We wanted to do some obvious sightseeing and found the tube and bus use very easy The number 83 bus stops right outside the hotel and drops you off at Wembley Park tube where you can get a tube to anywhere for little money and not a lot of time Make sure you buy an Oyster card not the visitor one We got ours in kings cross they cost 5 each We put 40 each onto our cards and travelled for basically 3 5 days We got unused money back as well as the 5 for the card The public transport is easy and if your unsure just ask staff in the station 
188864,St George s Hotel Wembley, I ve never had to show the card I booked the hotel with anyway before and as I use my mother s card to book hotels it was very difficult to show the card to the stuff, The room was comfy and a fair size
188865,St George s Hotel Wembley, I object to paying for parking when I have paid for a room, Staff are always friendly and the facilities are excellent Rooms have more comfort and facilities than most hotels at this price 
188866,St George s Hotel Wembley, Having to pay 10 parking 25 on event days I would expect actual parking spaces not try squeeze your car into a tight gap next to a wall or another car I had asked for a bath as I have really bad sciatica and wanted to be able to relax Also had asked for a balcony as the room I was given didn t even have a window I could open The light on the wall was broken dirty mirrors The bed wasn t clean the bathroom wasn t clean I ve stayed here previously before booked 20mins after 10pm before I arrived had asked for a bath balcony which I was given Was disappointed was planning to come back not sure I will again ,No Positive
188867,St George s Hotel Wembley, The weather was a bit hot when we stayed but the air con is not that powerful it took about 2 hours for it to cool down the room , Bathroom is very good clean and staff was also very helpful The location is excellent just 5min walking to Wembley stadium But if you want to go to central London bus stop is just outside of the hotel It takes about 40 min to go to central London from the hotel There is a shopping centre in 10min walking distance easy to find the good food 
188868,St George s Hotel Wembley, THIS IS ANOTHER GOOD POINT The hotel is pure luxury Very clean and modern with lots of nice features such as air con dimmer lights a balcony some rooms only a great shower large flat screen tv and parking , This hotel is in a fantastic location right next to Wembley Stadium with a Tesco store and shopping outlet centre full of great restaurants 5 minutes walk away 
188869,St George s Hotel Wembley, Paid 180 b b 3 months ago only for sister in law to make a late booking 3 days before stay and got same booking for 114 wasn t happy , Good hotel clean and modern
188870,St George s Hotel Wembley, nothing, First visit to this hotel and couldn t have wished for a better place All the staff were friendly and helpful and the restaurant was one of the best Italians we have eaten at 
188871,St George s Hotel Wembley, The staff upon arrival were rude and unhelpful The bathroom door wouldn t close or lock The balcony is useless because there s no chairs or anything outside to enjoy the breeze or view of the stadium The chef couldn t even make a soft boiled egg upon request despite waiting 10 minutes for one the continental breakfast is very limited and doesn t offer choices for gluten free or lactose free individuals , The bed was very comfortable and I like the modern technological twist to the rooms The picture illustrates this 
188872,St George s Hotel Wembley, As I said just the bacon was too well done and the beans cold It would have been nice to have a late check out of around 2pm would have been nice But this is not a complaint , The staff were so helpful and Barman was very friendly and chatty This made our stay very nice The room was perfect We would recommend you Hotel to others Only one thing the bacon at breakfast was too well cooked and the beans were cold But it was busy Apart from that First Class Hotel and Lovely Staff 
188873,St George s Hotel Wembley, New hotel and very clean etc but there are many small issues like door keys not working glass side mirrors broken water running in the toilet after flush etc , Very good new and clean hotel A lot of the features are what you will find only in Luxury hotels
188874,St George s Hotel Wembley, Car parking charges I suppose being London only to be expected but parking was gated and secure , Spacious room and very comfortable bed A TV to watch in the bath Not that I did but it was a touch of luxury I hadn t come across before 
188875,St George s Hotel Wembley, Staff was exceptionally rude Double booking was accidentally made and was asked to pay cancellation fee of full amount when it was supposed to be half amount Receptionist was amused at this We came at 6am and was told we can t check in fair enough We asked if we can leave our luggages and come back to check in they said yes absolutely Then was charged by the hotel for keeping our luggages when we are their guest Do yourself a favor choose a different hotel , Comfortable beds and room temperature regulating system La Regina restaurant is good 
188876,St George s Hotel Wembley, Breakfast starting at 7am can be a bit limiting for business people who need an early start I could only take breakfast on 1 day and a bowl of cereal on 1 day this on a 4 night stay , Overall a good hotel and in a good location for my needs 
188877,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, Friendly staff on checking in especially the manager Very clean and modern room and we had a lovely big balcony breakfast was lovely and great value for money Ideal for Wembley stadium We would definitely stay here again Thank you team 
188878,St George s Hotel Wembley, We booked the hotel because of the Italian restaurant but were not allowed to book a table due to Wembley football fans drinking on a first come first served basis We had to eat elsewhere which was very disappointing , The room layout was good and the breakfast room was also good 
188879,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, Staff great and very friendly rooms amazing with all up to date technology and luxuries Clean and comfortable No noise disturbance Car parking very secure Excellent location 
188880,St George s Hotel Wembley, Insufficient staffing for breakfast stations overwhelmed while the tables were 3 4 full Larger beds would be more appreciated , Good vicinity to central London high room interior quality reasonable price Staffs polite and friendly 
188881,St George s Hotel Wembley, the remote in the bathroom had flat batteries but hey who wants to watch eastenders while on the throne ha ha, the young lady at reception Ana was the most helpful receptionist ive met and very pleasant was very good with other demanding guests thank you
188882,St George s Hotel Wembley, If we had to be really really picky the bacon was slightly disappointing Tasted like it had been reheated Everything else was perfect , We stayed here for the Liverpool Barca game the staff are extremely efficient here The place is just around the corner from the stadium so great location for the games The room was beautiful and the bed was very comfortable the full cooked English breakfast was a bonus We will definitely stay again 
188883,St George s Hotel Wembley, Location and actual quality of the food coffee etc in the restaurant but this seems to be a London issue , The staff were really great better than I have seen in London the best 
188884,St George s Hotel Wembley, The noise of The air conditioning was too much and it was not conducive for a good nights sleep The room was a bit small and there was no satellite tv as stated on blurb of hotel , The bathroom especially the shower was lovely 
188885,St George s Hotel Wembley, Better air con as room was boiling hot even with temp turned down didn t seem to be working properly Very noisy from traffic outside, The room in general and shower were very good The Restaurant was good
188886,St George s Hotel Wembley, Only downsides would be the wifi password wasn t written down anywhere and there was no toilet brush in our bathroom , Very friendly staff upon arrival and checkout great value for money Rooms are beautiful and there are a lot of great facilities we particularly loved all the functions in the bedrooms light settings next to bed door bells etc 
188887,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, We are really happy with your hotel rooms is really nice bathroom is very comfy with the large bath with tv we get a room first without balcony but i tried to change the room and hes on the recepcion Ted give us an other room he is really friendly also lady from recepcion romanian girl was very nice and frendly to We will be back soon as we can Thanks for your 5 service Also thanks a lot for the recepcion guys 
188888,St George s Hotel Wembley, We were bought the weekend away as a gift and the credit card needed to be present , The lady on reception was lovely Made us feel very welcome the hotel was beautiful and my partner was very impressed with the TV in the bath 
188889,St George s Hotel Wembley, The hair dryer supplied was wired in a drawer and would not reach enough to see myself in the mirror Made drying my hair a nightmare and the hotel really do not to address this Also breakfast was very unorganised and we had to ask for numerous things Ie coffee glasses and bread etc they also bought out breakfast and did not tell us beforehand that they had run out of some items also over priced at 9 50 as this does not include cereals or fruit The hotel seemed very short staffed at times , The rooms were excellent with large comfy beds fab air con and huge tv The bathrooms are also superb probably the best bathroom I have found in a hotel They even have a tv at the end of the bath There are a few negatives below but this hotel has one of the nicest rooms we have ever stopped in and will definitely use again I would just advise that you go to one of the local eateries for breakfast 
188890,St George s Hotel Wembley, Nothing everything was perfect, The staff was so helpful and friendly they was so kind in extending our car park for an extra 24 hours whilst we travelled around London The room was such good value for money overall stay couldn t have been better 
188891,St George s Hotel Wembley, Nothing, The receptionist upon check in was friendly and helpful He helped me to get a new remote for my television within minutes and helped with every enquiry I had The room was immaculate and the staff were very friendly including the lady who bought my ironing board and the waiter for my evening meal and breakfast

188894,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, Very helpful and friendly staff Good restaurant Andrea is delightful and made our evening special Reception team really helpful parking great for this location 
188895,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, The bath and shower were excellent A TV over the bath was a great way to chill after a busy day Very pleasant and helpful staff Very clean room with good facilities Excellent air con which was needed on a very hot day 
188896,St George s Hotel Wembley, Curtain not blackout not good in summer unless you bring eye shades Also some basic amenities missing that one would expect from a 4 star hotel e g face tissues as a minimum No ironing board in room asked for it personally at reception but it never turned up Coffee at breakfast awful and bitter Breakfast ends too early at 10 am Check out time too early at 11 00 am annoying the standard in most hotels is 12 noon All of the above didn t bother us too much as we were there for only one night but would be irritating on longer stays providing feedback mainly to allow this new hotel to improve on these deficiencies , Upgraded to superior deluxe room hotel interiors and room had a very luxurious feel Other positives 1 very competitively priced for location reasonably priced parking space good location 2 In room air conditioner with fan and temperature controls large and comfy bed funky in room touch control panel for lights which could be dimmed to romantic mood lighting levels Overall a very pleasant experience for a one night stay Some minor deficiencies certainly need improving but meanwhile would highly recommend 
188897,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, The hotel is spotless clean situated in a good location near the Wembley Stadion The location is perfect for the events taking place at the Wembley Stadion and it provides good access to the tourist attractions from the center of London There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel which takes you to the Wembley Park tube stop 3 bus stops away from the hotel or a 10 15 minutes walk From the Wembley Park tube stop the center of London is easily reached via the Jubilee or the Metropolitan lines Both the room and the bathroom are very spacious modernly furnished and clean The room is equipped with touch sensitive buttons for light controlling do not disturb and room cleaning The staff is very friendly and helpful especially Ana and Bogdan who made sure all our requests were immediately acted upon and solved A special thanks to Ana for all the useful tips she provided us in regards to sightseeing means of transport surroundings of the hotel and for organizing a very appreciated surprise for my birthday which made our stay at this hotel even more pleasant For my next trip to London I will definitely book this hotel again 
188898,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, Staff were really friendly and helpful Room was very clean and luxurious location was fantastic for concert we came to London to see only my 4th visit to London in my 47 yrs just a village girl in the big city could nt have chosen a better place to stay Thank you
188899,St George s Hotel Wembley, Little disappointed that I asked for and paid for an upgraded room so we could have a view of Wembley stadium balcony We could just about see the arch and that was it Not worth the extra money when our friends room was pretty much identical and they paid 60 less Can t complain about the hotel room or staff though Everything was great Just a shame about the price, The facilities within the room were great Really clean and tidy too Reception staff were very helpful and friendly
188900,St George s Hotel Wembley, Having my vehicle damaged via a visitor pretty disappointing to say the least but wasn t the bone cruncher to my enjoyment, The entertainment in the bedroom the TV
188901,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, On arrival was welcomed by friendly staff rooms were bright clean and enough space for us Close to wembley stadium as that s why we booked for a concert there enjoyed the stay Hopefully be back soon
188902,St George s Hotel Wembley, The restaurant attached could do with some improvements and staff training in our experience this was the only let down to the hotel however they redeemed themselves with a tasty breakfast , Perfect location for event at Wembley fab modern rooms with all the mod cons you need Super friendly efficient reception staff Probably one of the best hotels I ve stayed in and at a fab price through booking com 
188903,St George s Hotel Wembley, Only issue was with the room door that malfunctioned due to a battery fault , Overall very good location for access to local amities and Wembley Stadium 
188904,St George s Hotel Wembley, Noisy but is on a fairly main street Staff were all little unhelpful took 3 attempts to get a bar bill of 2 drinks correct not that difficult surely was made to feel like this was a major inconvenience for them , Location for the stadium is fab Rooms good size for London Bathroom excellent although didn t get around to watching the bathroom tv Beds comfy 
188905,St George s Hotel Wembley, The room was freezing cold during the night and couldn t get warm the heating did not seem to work no suggestions on how to keep warm please ,No Positive
188906,St George s Hotel Wembley, There is nothing we dont like about this hotel , We have stayed here a few times now and the staff are amazing so helpful the rooms are all very clean and nice and the beds comfortable We ordered room service for dinner and its was lovely As well as good value for money Out of all the hotels we have stayed in this is our favourite 
188907,St George s Hotel Wembley, After asking for a high room we got the first floor just off the stairs Terribly unsafe After asking for a twin room we got a disabled twin adapted room Which meant no nice bathroom and red emergency cords all over So infuriating when the hotel actually has real nice rooms , Stayed here before and had a great room with an amazing bathroom No noise Tv is large and complimentary water 
188908,St George s Hotel Wembley, Almost nothing A bit of a walk from the underground station , Staff were extremely friendly The room was super clean and comfy Facilities are very modern Great location with lots of shops Cleaning service was also great 
188909,St George s Hotel Wembley, I had booked parking for two days in advance which is very limited and was told upon check out that I wasn t booked to park there again that day so had to find an alternative Small mistake but cost me an extra 30 or so to find another parking location , The room was comfy spacious and the various lights were a nice touch 
188910,St George s Hotel Wembley, Twin room was smaller than average and car parking spaces are narrow but nothing bad to report , Car park entrance is on the street to the right of the hotel but can only be reached via the one way system to the left of the hotel The reception is not signposted at the door from the car park go down the stairs rather than up Twin room was very clean and modern and digital lighting is a nice touch lets you select from 3 brightness settings and does the rest for you Reception staff were friendly and helpful Didn t try the breakfast but at 10 for cooked to order it sounds like very good value for London 
188911,St George s Hotel Wembley, Air conditioning didn t seem to work for us that well but wasn t bad , TV in the bathroom Comfy bed Fancy touch controls around the room Location to train station underground and outlet stores 
188912,St George s Hotel Wembley, Nothing to dislike, Love this Hotel 2nd time I ve stayed and will stay again Lovely mediteranean style hotel perfectly clean and comfortable on site parking for reasonable charge uber polite and friendly staff great on site italian restaurant and quality breakfast highly recommended
188913,St George s Hotel Wembley, Nice room clean a little hot breakfast had a hair at bottom of mushrooms that had been placed in a small pot I didn t complain as I m British also had to remind the waiter twice for some brown sauce , The telly in the bath
188914,St George s Hotel Wembley, The room was extremely hot even after the maintenance came the aircon did not work Breakfast very basic for the price we paid for a four star hotel The bar serving drinks in plastic cups was disgusting No tea or coffee facilities in the room Towels cheap and thin Very low standard for the price we paid , Close to Wembley but not overlooking as described so a bit misleading 
188915,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, I love the minute we enter the hotel the staff was friendly and professional the room was absolutely clean and comfortable I was impress to see a tv in the bathroom Overall we had a fantastic time here 
188916,St George s Hotel Wembley, Absolutely nothing felt like 5 star luxury at a 3 star price Only downside was distance to the underground network at about a 15min walk , Size of the bed was incredible ease of temperature control was perfect and tv in the bath was fantastic Wish we could have stayed for longer 
188917,St George s Hotel Wembley, Wifi connection was slightly spotty in certain areas of the lobby but the connection was perfect in my room , Found the nearest available hotel I could after a booking mishap was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the establishment It is a fantastic hotel by all counts but it was the little things that really stood out touch screen controls for housekeeping privacy directly next to your bed which also includes controls for all the lights which were conveniently all dimmer switches and a very clean modern interface for heat control Additionally the room had a wonderful control console for the television which also featured an incredibly convenient European not uk plug Without that I would not have been able to charge my phone as I had forgotten my eu to UK converter Though that s not entirely correct as there are USB ports scattered around the room with even an hdmi connector for the TV Bathroom was also very clean and modern but nothing to write home about The staff were also incredibly helpful and friendly All in all I can safely say that this was one of the nicest hotels I ve ever had the pleasure of staying in and will prefer it if I ever find myself in the UK again 
188918,St George s Hotel Wembley, The use of plastic glasses after the gig Also being told there wasn t any food available but watching other turn up after us order and then eat it , The continental breakfast was very tasty and plenty to choose from We had a great view of the stadium and the room was very comfortable and clean Would definitely stay again 
188919,St George s Hotel Wembley, Nothing as my daughter and I booked it for a concert at Wembley Arena which was just across the road perfect location for this If I was to be really picky it was a 10 min walk to the nearest tube and a 20 min ride into central London but still wouldn t swap the hotel and its staff for one nearer , helpfulness and friendliness of all the staff who couldn t do enough for you excellent meals and service brilliant restaurant tables not set on top of one another Rooms spotless and comfortable with a brilliant bathroom and shower 
188920,St George s Hotel Wembley, Poor welcome at reception and given wrong room key so had to return from 5 the floor to get replacement Heating sensor in room broken so arrival temperature was 32 degrees Reported it no action taken Tea and coffee facilities not topped up Most solid and uncomfortable pillows I ve ever had Generally felt that hotel was trying to be a boutique hotel but failed Just seemed as if nothing quite worked and staff certainly weren t at a level that one would expect for that cost Compared to other Wembley hotels massively overpriced , Very easy to get to Parking available 
188921,St George s Hotel Wembley, Wine in plastic cups at the bar Breakfast paid the extra for a hot breakfast which could have been better Also the filter coffee was luke warm, The room size cleanliness of hotel room The room facilities the added touch of complimentary wine in the room Helpful staff 
188922,St George s Hotel Wembley, Room was a little cold and couldn t work out how the heating controls worked or maybe they wernt working at all Only thing that annoyed us slightly Came back after the concert and staff had obviously taken off the draught beer from the bar to make you buy the more expensive bottles 9 00 for a bottle of beer and a coke Draught beers were back on first thing in the morning , Lovely welcome Well situated for Wembley stadium Lovely modern interior Very Clean 
188923,St George s Hotel Wembley, The A C was off and couldn t be adjusted from the room was way too hot The safe wouldn t open and they didn t come to sort this on return to the room it was freezing Again had to call reception to get this sorted , Very clean and a great location for Wembley The bed was a double and very comfortable Great shower too 
188924,St George s Hotel Wembley, We had a couple of communications problems trying to request champagne for our friends who were celebrating their wedding anniversary however everything was sorted by the hotel with rose petals as well Thank you , Rooms Pizza was excellent and breakfast Location is superb if going to a concert like we were in Wembely Would def stay again 
188925,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, All the staff were exceptionally helpful and pleasant the room was a lovely size with a very comfortable large bed gorgeous bathroom with a TV in the bath and spotlessly clean everywhere excellent location for Wembley Stadium less than 10 mins walk 
188926,St George s Hotel Wembley, Liked everything , The whole hotel was very clean staff lovely rooms very nice and food in restaurant was excellent Overall very nice hotel and location great for wembley stadium Definitely recommend this hotel 
188927,St George s Hotel Wembley, Obviously I m am a able personal and I m 6 2 It it very challenging for me to stay in a physical challenge room I had to bend down all time when I was in the toilet And there is one hanger for the used towel when is next to the toilet bowl and obviously too low to hang a bathing towel It will be touch both the toilet bowl or toilet floor I need to hang the used towl on the door lock handle Well it is not very nice to stay there for a able person And I didn t voice out as my deal was a 80 off from booking com Is that all good deals are offering physical challenge room to booking com customers , King size bed is comfortable 
188928,St George s Hotel Wembley, The toilet roll holder was missing and the paper got wet on the side , Really it was the perfect hotel for me Travelling on my own and attending a concert at Wembley I felt completely confident that when I left my friends I would return easily and safely back to the hotel with no stress to spoil the wonderful concert 
188929,St George s Hotel Wembley, Majorly overpriced No breakfast even though we paid major amount of money Looked like a converted office block Advertised pRking but none available Staff really uninterested, Really close to wembley
188930,St George s Hotel Wembley, Room was very stuffy and impossible to have fresh air because windows do not open We also complained to the receptionist about this issue and he did nothing about it , The room was spacious and modern 
188931,St George s Hotel Wembley, Nothing, i don t know where to start the room was amazing value for money brilliant staff very comfy beds shower was brilliant loved all the gimmicks such as touch buttons for the lights and the air con absolutely brilliant 
188932,St George s Hotel Wembley, Bath towels small No plastic beaker in bathroom No pen to make notes, Having a secure car park Staff friendly No road noise at the rear of the hotel
188933,St George s Hotel Wembley, Although check in was at 3pm we arrived for 12 45pm As our event started at 1pm at the Wembley Stadium we would have liked to freshen up first after a 3 hour drive There was no room available for this and no rooms would be given till 3pm as I was told previous guests had only left at 12 noon Check out the next day was 11am but a maid entered our room at 10 52am to clean it When we left the room there were at least 3 or 4 maids cleaning the other rooms So surely there was a possibility that some rooms were ready earlier than 3pm Other hotels in the area have accommodated us in previous years earlier than the quoted check in time in the knowledge that the event at Wembley was taking place , This is a nice clean and comfortable hotel conveniently located near Wembley Stadium All mod cons in the bedroom and a good comfy bed slept well 
188934,St George s Hotel Wembley, None of the staffs first language was English which isn t a problem but they stood there rudely speaking their own language Bed was rock hard and uncomfortable and late check in, Amazing location right next to Wembley which we were attending Fantastic facilities including a TV in the bathroom
188935,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, This hotel really knows the definition of customer service Initially checked in only to get to the door and the card didn t work not a good start went to reception to get another key card and as a good gesture the receptionist upgraded me to an executive room winning 
188936,St George s Hotel Wembley, It would have been nice to have had a variety of pillows in the room as the ones we had were very uncomfortable Our room was at the front and there was some noise from the road but the balcony doors were good at soundproofing and blocking most of the noise out , Lovely hotel very spacious stylish and clean not cluttered with signs and notices everywhere like some hotels Staff were very friendly We checked in early and left our bags while we went to a gig We returned after 10pm to collect our bags to be told our bags had already been taken to our room which was great customer service Extra points The air conditioning was good and the TV was huge and there was a TV in the bathroom shower great there was also a separate hand held shower nice balcony view of the Wembley stadium arch Location is fab for the stadium and the hotel is 1 minute from Wembley Stadium train station 
188937,St George s Hotel Wembley, Location if visiting central London It is approx 25 minutes on the tube Great however if going for a match , The Hotel is brand new and as such is in excellent condition The rooms are finished to a very high standard 42 TV and even a tv in the bath Other than being quite a bit out of the centre of London we would definately stay here again Staff were also very helpful with our requests 
188938,St George s Hotel Wembley, Staff were a little curt but very helpful There is a hidden charge on arrival for a safety deposit which is I think 10 on a card or 150 cash I don t feel that this was made apparent when booking and there were three other people who were equally as surprised as me This needs addressing Additionally my card had failed when they had tried to take payment prior to my arrival This was intentional on my part as I had tried to pay the day before with a different card over the phone and was told I couldn t as there was already a pre authorized card on my account so I decided to pay cash on arrival I explained all of this to the concierge who informed me that when your card fails they don t hold your reservation and that you can in fact pay over the phone actually and that he would try his best to fit me in if they happened to have a room I felt that his tone was more in the realm of telling me off rather than apologizing and trying to find out who had misinformed me and why Luckily they had a room because if they hadn t I would have been absolutely livid I don t believe your guests should be made to feel like naughty children because of the hotels lack of communication and knowledge of their own policies That being said apart from this incident they could not have been more attentive and helpful , It was perfectly situated for Wembley Arena plenty of shops restaurants and leisure facilities within 5 minutes walk Bus stops right outside and train station is across the road The room was beautiful spotless and the bed was a delight to sleep on and the decor had a Mal Maison feel to it Nice and quiet can t fault it for the price
188939,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and attentive and couldn t be more apologetic with certain things The room was modern and the television in the bath was such a luxury 
188940,St George s Hotel Wembley, One of the staff was a little challenging could have just been having a bad day though , Great room very spacious comfy bed and TV in the bath Breakfast was very tasty and the check in and out was very easy Location was excellent 
188941,St George s Hotel Wembley, In our opinion this is not a five star hotel This was the most expensive room we had stayed in on several visits to London and was not worth the money we paid No toilet rolls in our bathroom when we arrived so we had to request some from reception The Lady who brought the t rolls to our room was rather rude and needed to see the empty toilet roll holder before she gave us one No apology was given from her The room was very small and the twin beds were not particularly comfortable with quilts that just about covered your torso We are ladies size 8 and 12 so I pity any male occupants Towels toiletries were not 5 star high quality only two English breakfast tea bags left in the room and no hot Chocolate sachets Lots of UHT milk cartons left in the fridge why and one of the two milk cartons we opened was off so we had just one cup of tea The milk cartons should be checked and changed on a daily basis The cost of the room was maybe due to the extra television in the bathroom A facility which we did not use and we considered this addition unnecessary in this type of room standard In our opinion it is obvious that you pay a higher price for a room when there is an event at Wembley but this was not worth the extra cost The next time we will choose a central London hotel and travel to Wembley , Reception staff were welcoming friendly and were quick to solve our problem re lack of toilet rolls in bathroom Having stayed at other Wembley hotels when attending previous events we have had to que for breakfast and the restaurants were understaffed for the number of guests At this hotel breakfast was a more pleasant experience with clean tables and a friendly waitress The Air conditioning in our room worked well as it was a hot night Good position for Wembley Stadium with a quiet atmosphere 
188942,St George s Hotel Wembley, Bath towels too small No mini bar facility only two bottles of water and no nibbles or snacks Only UHT milk supplied with tea coffee and no biscuits Double room but only one glass provided Lack of toiletries Enjoyed the breakfast but would have appreciated more choice ie eggs scrambled poached etc For a 5 star hotel would expect a few extras , Rooms clean and spacious Bed comfortable Breakfast very good 
188943,St George s Hotel Wembley, bar prices are way too high maybe look at a tariff for residents on Wembley event days , Location very close to Wembley on site parking i had an issue that the following days parking was not booked but very quickly sorted by the staff 1st class happy hour great value rooms very well appointed 
188944,St George s Hotel Wembley, We were on a high floor so we had no windows to open, There was a TV in the bath the room was super spacious the television in the bedroom was huge and bad many functions the view we had showed us Wembley stadium there s a panel that controlled lights and temp by each bed right next to London designer outfit so perfect location for food and shopping
188945,St George s Hotel Wembley, Light switch was hanging off when we walked into the room I took a picture it was fixed but should of been fitted correctly in the first place The wifi code was not given to us upon check in like everyone else When we used the wifi It was useless and there is no excuse for poor wifi , The bed was really comfortable

188969,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, This was a comfortable hotel and convenient for the Wembley area The price seemed reasonable as it included breakfast however the Sting in the tale was that the breakfast included was for the continental A surcharge had to be paid for a cooked breakfast The continental breakfast was poor but the cooked extra cost was good I would stay again but I think there is better value in the Wembley area

188981,St George s Hotel Wembley, Breakfast wasn t provided in the Booking com deal and parking should be free but was an additional 10 and more if there is an event at Wembley which I think is terrible Parking should be fixed at one price if you are staying there regardless if there is an event at Wembley or not, Very modern and lovely hotel 
188982,St George s Hotel Wembley, Ordered a cooked breakfast Unfortunately it seems as if the chef cooks everything together in the same pan in the same lard The omelette was greasy and smelled of lard Not nice for those who don t eat ham , The rooms were a great size unlike the Normal tiny and dingy London rooms The location to shops and the tube station were great too Bathrooms were amazing

188985,St George s Hotel Wembley, Normal hotel happy hour for a cheap drink is between 15 00 18 00 this was no the case when I was at the hotel the excuse given was they do not have this offer on when there was an event on near by Would be interested to see if this applies when a basket ball event is on near by What they mean is they can charge football fans full price this was not mentioned when booking so I was not happy the upshot was I went elsewhere for my drink Another point they did not give me a wake up call in the morning even though I asked for one other than that 160 00 for one night is the usual London football rip off , The location for a Wembley football was excellent Staff very nice nothing much else to like 
188986,St George s Hotel Wembley, The WiFi was really bad Very slow and kept disconnevting There was some mechanical noise constantly running at night which was a little annoying but not sure if it was just our room , Modern Facilities flat screen tv mounted on wall with HDMI and Bluetooth support Temperature and light dimming controls on bedside wall TV in shower Close to Stadium and designer outlet Overall the room looked nice and more modern looking than others I been to

189000,St George s Hotel Wembley, The car parking was 17 50 a day but this was not pointed out on the website Also the deluxe twin room we had was good but it was actually a disabled room which didn t really matter but the sink and toilet were lower than usual , The staff were helpful and friendly location room size and the large tv

189014,St George s Hotel Wembley, Next to the road so some noise reception struggled to work out where they could hold my hanging garments when I arrived and asked them to hold them until later in the day new staff member , Had my room upgraded very nice room
189015,St George s Hotel Wembley, The WIFI system They use some consists of some sort of code system to second party server not really a fan of it and the codes always came up wrong needs a new wifi system and room cleaners could be more on the go instead of lazy , Room was well furnished and the reception staff were excellent
189016,St George s Hotel Wembley, Main lights came on several times throughout the night and for us the room was too warm Maybe we should have read instruction manual for the digital system Towels were on the small side Bath sheets instead of bath towels would be have been better , Overall appearance pleasing to the eye Location superb for SSE Cleanliness facilities and size of room excellent

189019,St George s Hotel Wembley, Car park is a joke Pay 25 for the privilege not enough room to swing a cat even though you have to call and pre book Suggestion get a parking attendant to at least direct the cars you have booked in to optimise space It s not ideal to start the weekend stressed out over parking a car , Location is spot on Rooms are lovely all mod cons even a tv in the bath Shower is awesome Comfy bed Restaurant nice as long as order strictly off the menu If can arrive on foot public transport would be one of the best places in Wembley to stay

189021,St George s Hotel Wembley, When receiving my toast the waitress never bought butter up to the room but apart from that no other complaints, Size of the room and the bed everywhere was very clean staff was very helpful through out our stay
189022,St George s Hotel Wembley, Bedrrom was at different heights to the balcony and bathroom view wasnt the best and aesthetics from outside not brilliant , Rooms were very warm and welcoming new and modern 
189023,St George s Hotel Wembley, The hair blow dryer in the drawer could have done with a longer lead The lights kept turning off after roughly 30 minutes guessing it s energy saving , The hotel was easy to find and in great location even though it was on a busy road the traffic could hardly be heard in the room The room was big and the bed was so comfortable too The TV screen in the bathroom was a pleasant surprise too Breakfast was lovely we upgraded to full English The meal in the evening was lovely too 
189024,St George s Hotel Wembley, The towels were very small they did not appear to be bath towel size Most hotels provide bath sheets now This was the only thing that let this hotel down, The staff were all very helpful and extremely pleasant when dealing with any query

189026,St George s Hotel Wembley, Nothing couldn t have been better , The staff were so friendly and couldn t have been more helpful Even went and bought more plasters for me when the dreaded new shoe pain struck 
189027,St George s Hotel Wembley, There was a clear communication barrier between myself and staff at the restaurant over the phone for room service She wasn t able to understand English very well and became frustrated quickly When I asked questions about what s on offer she told me to look at the menu I asked for drinks and she also told me to look back at the menu as they re were no drinks on the menu it was clear the only way to get one with my food was to go downstairs which defeats the objective of room service Also when our food came it came without the sauce stated on the menu I called back and rather than an apology she made out like the sauce was optional rather than part of the meal although that s not the case as Calamari should definitely come with a sauce , Beautiful place Very modern and unique Great decor lovely staff and a loads of fancy touches For example the TV in the bath has to be one of my favourites As we stayed Valentine s Day there was also a romantic kissing swan presentation on the bed with pretty petals which i absolutely adored 
189028,St George s Hotel Wembley, If I have one fault with my stay it was with the cooked breakfast bacon was so much under cooked I couldn t eat it I did ask staff to ask chef to cook it more and she said she would get me some more which was no different , This hotel was excellent staff was so helpful and couldn t do enough for us Great location to shops and arena rooms were spotless and lots of rooms We were very lucky to get one off the few parking spaces
189029,St George s Hotel Wembley, More T bags could only make one cup of tea towels in the bathroom are thin not good quality and not big enough TV in the bath is okay to watch if your sitting bolt upright Lay back in the bath and the picture is hard to see Had a meal in the restaurant and although my husband enjoyed his chicken I was very disappointed with my Frutti di Mare it was very bland and not seasoned did not taste of fish at all , Very well appointed rooms with modern feel Bed very comfortable 
189030,St George s Hotel Wembley, The only small issues for us were 1 The towels have seen better days and need to be changed They were clean but a bit thread bare 2 There was no lock for balcony door We did query this but staff did not get back to us on it , First impressions of hotel were good Staff were friendly and welcoming Hotel presentation was clean and airey Room was clean and spacious with a balcony Bed was comfortable and bedding lovely and clean We ate in the restarant downstairs and the food was nice and reasonably priced Hotel is in great position for both Arena and Stadium but far enough away so you do not have to put up with the noise from the shops and earteries which are also close by We really enjoyed our stay 
189031,St George s Hotel Wembley, I was amazed to find I could not add anything from the restaurant to my room account Also with regard to the restaurant I found the staff at sixes and seven I had to ask for a menu as I felt we were invisible for some time The restaurant staff were running around as if they were unsure of their bearings and where to go next , The room and the entire hotel was spotlessly clean The shower was amazing and the hotel was ideally situated for the Wembley experience 
189032,St George s Hotel Wembley, The beds did seem to be a bit like skateboards but we managed ok , The staff were extremely friendly and helpful the room was lovely and we had a lovely evening meal in the restaurant 
189033,St George s Hotel Wembley, We had a room on the first floor overlooking the main road so there was some traffic noise However that was only a minor thing , Stayed just one night Lovely hotel the room was very modern clean and comfortable There was even a tv screen above the bath with a remote control The staff were very friendly We ate dinner and breakfast in the restaurant and the choice was good and so was the food The staff in the restaurant were friendly and helpful As this is a new hotel I hope that they keep up the standard as time goes on I will certainly go back there again 
189034,St George s Hotel Wembley, More lifts , They listened to my requests Room was modern and high tech with amazing features Check in was easy Continental breakfast was good as there was a lot of choice considering 
189035,St George s Hotel Wembley, Nothing , The room was fabulous even had a TV in the bathroom Comfy beds and la regina the onsite restaurant served lovely food 5 all the way highly recommended close to Wembley stadium and arena and shops 
189036,St George s Hotel Wembley, Bath towels could have been bigger and parking charge could have been smaller but didn t spoil the stay, Staff very friendly and helpful and very favourably price for London
189037,St George s Hotel Wembley, The parking charges 25 for one night because of a show a bit wrong really but that said a very nice hotel, Very nice room staff members very nice great for Wembley stadium and arena fabulous time had Thanks
189038,St George s Hotel Wembley, i dont think there was anything i could say could have been better except maybe the dining room was a little small some people were waiting a while for a free table , we were very impressed by the cleanliness and style of the rooms Breakfast was very nice a good choice and very fresh I particularly enjoyed the fresh fruit 
189039,St George s Hotel Wembley, Thought the car park price was a bit steep , Surprised at how luxurious our room was the bed was very comfortable Will certainly use this hotel again

189042,St George s Hotel Wembley, The location could have been better We got Lost when we go there cause there was no directions on the road they only had The hotel name on the building itself rather high up The good side obviously was close to local tesco The designer outlet and visiting Wembley stadium was fabulous The only struggle was commuting into central London there was transport access avialable but it could ve been better Within a few hours of being our key pass for our room had broken which was frustrating after we was given a key but we didn t know where abouts it was as not on show but also down to lack of communication from staff but once a told shown it was okay Staff were very friendly and lovely but on the odd occasion lacked to pass on information , The hotel itself was very clean well presented and modern Myself and my boyfriend were very pleased with the hotel room and fully used all facilities to its full potentional We slept very well as it was rather quiet spacious tv in the bath and the bath shower itself It was very clean Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and was worth it s money Would definatly recommend and go back to stay again in the future 
189043,St George s Hotel Wembley, The staff didn t speak English I asked for bathrobes and got a iron Never got bathrobes The water was not hot in the first day The bed is very hard but easy to get used to, The room is very lovely and cosey
189044,St George s Hotel Wembley, I can t fault the hotel view could of been nicer though also a bath would have been nice too , The bed was lovely and the hotel was lovely and quiet
189045,St George s Hotel Wembley, Got one of the hotels five handicap rooms very low sink The hotel staff didn t understand our question about big beds or double instead of small twin beds when checking in Had hoped to get warm breakfast included in the room price but that was 5 Pound extra pp , Went for a concert at SSE Arena Wembley so the location was great for that About 20 min by tube to central London so ok Opposite side of the road from London designer outlet and a lot of restaurants Clean rooms Ok breakfast 
189046,St George s Hotel Wembley, Breakfast was just about of an acceptable standard but not good No decaffeinated coffee available except for 2 sachets of instant in our room so could not have a hot drink at breakfast Towels were small and rather thin quality Traffic noise was intrusive from around 5am although this is not the fault of the hotel , Room was spotlessly clean Staff were very friendly and helpful Bed was comfortable I would happily stay again Complimentary chilled water in mini bar was appreciated 
189047,St George s Hotel Wembley, Staff lacking etiquette at the reception There is not plug in for the hair drier other in the bathroom Tiles of the bathroom were untidy We were given a room for disable without having being notified , Close to wembley rail station Bus stop in front Tube within walking distance Modern and tasteful deco Confortable room

189049,St George s Hotel Wembley, The drinks were a little bit on the pricey side 7 for a Coke and a fanta , The very helpful staff Superb room massive walking shower very comfy bed 
189050,St George s Hotel Wembley, The signal is poor inside but this can t really be changed and there s some good wifi available ask at the front desk , The staff were so friendly and the location couldn t be better for a spot of shopping at the really close outlet stores and Wembley Arena shows Wembley Stadium games Both the interior and exterior looks professional clean and modern but never looks clinical and unfriendly Recommended all the way the price is unbeatable 
189051,St George s Hotel Wembley, Customer service in general was poor We had problems with our air conditioning all weekend Reception staff were very unaccommodating and rigid The food was terrible We were served pizza without a tomato base I was called at 11 30pm to pay my bill when I m a loyal customer who hasn t given any reason to think I would not pay When I asked for help with bags I was told there are no facilities for this even though later on found that there were trollers available , The location is good for me

189053,St George s Hotel Wembley, Cannot find a thing, There is nothing negative could say about the hotel It was far better than the so called posh hotel we stayed in south Ken which was far more money Really value for money at st George s
189054,St George s Hotel Wembley, Nothing, We had an absolutely fantastic stay at the hotel brilliant value for money Its not close to London central about 15 20mins on the tube There is a bus stop right outside the hotel with frequent buses and just a short walk to the tube station Its across from london designer outlet which has plenty a bargin and good selection of resturants Staff were very helpful and welcoming The hotel itself has to be one of the cleanest hotels I have stayed in and that s saying a lot as I am really fussy Breakfast was lovely and plentyful Had an evening meal one of the days which was also lovely We have already booked to go back

189064,St George s Hotel Wembley, The continental was nice but Not much variety for the continental breakfast and the milk for tea and coffee was very cold which meant ur cup of tea or coffee would be cold by the time u sat down to enjoy it apart from amazing hotel, Room was amazing has amazing high tech bathroom was 10 10 out room had a telly in the bath took me awhile to figure out what it was at first lol Staff where amazing helpful and friendly even after my 19 month old dialled the emergency code on the telephone

189070,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, Staff where great room was great food in the resturant was good although we did have to wait for our main meal longer than I would expect but as we where in no hurry this was not an issuegreat
189071,St George s Hotel Wembley, The room I was given was had disability access which meant the bathroom was very bare and very low sink which was really awkward Calling for room service was very awkward They asked me to call back later on because the restaurant was busy They try to get people to go down to the restaurant more So felt like they didn t put the room service as priority I asked for a iron to be sent up to me in the morning And it didn t come until 15 mins before i was due to check out , It was really great value for money Really comfortable bed Nice quality furnishing Nice shower and the room service was really very good particularly the Seabass

189075,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, There were very welcoming staff on the front desk The room was nice and clean Allowed to check in earlier than the check in time In a nice enough area for local amenities The only downside is the traffic outside the hotel as it s situated on a busy road and must be close to a hospital or police station as there were endless sirens 
189076,St George s Hotel Wembley, The floor was a little unclean looks like the house keeper couldn t be bothered and the fact they charge you extra 25 to park the breakfast was only continental so not really worth the money you pay, Every thing really nice hotel

189087,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, Hotel room was stunning Staff polite and caring Only down side is the hotel on main road through Wembley which I busy 24hrs of the day Was a shame because the noise was loud and that had impact on sleep 
189088,St George s Hotel Wembley, We were told at reception that our room was upgraded for then to be given room keys to s room that hadn t been cleaned and beds that weren t made,No Positive
189089,St George s Hotel Wembley, While I am aware that rooms vary the difference between the room on our first stay and our second was quite big They were both sold as Deluxe but one was markedly less deluxe Had that been the first room we were given we would never have booked foe a second stay The room was still clean and the facilities were in tact but it was significantly smaller and lacked the tv in the bath that the other room had , Customer service was top notch We were offered an upgrade to a better room after we spoke to the front desk it didn t require a big fuss or complaint They simply read the situation and acted quickly Still a brilliant place to stay just be aware that variations in the rooms may be bigger than you expect 
189090,St George s Hotel Wembley, Room was not cleaned although it stated daily housekeeping The room was small would of liked it to be bigger seeing as I was in a executive suite It was not worth the amount I paid , The location to the train station and Wembley park was good

189092,St George s Hotel Wembley, Could be closer to underground station and could be closer to central London but twice a day we still found it an ok commute , The hotel is very nice new and the reception staff helpful Room was very spacious clean great amenities and comfortable It s across the street from the designer outlet with amazing restaurants lots to choose from 
189093,St George s Hotel Wembley, The fact that we arrived at 14 58 and they didn t let us check in until it was 15 00 was a bit disturbing What could possibly happen within 2 minutes Check out was at 11 Staff at first was a bit abrupt We had a balcony and we couldn t use it because the key was missing The price could have been lower but that s London , Cosy modern room Comfy bed In overall clean and nice hotel Although staff was a bit abrupt at first it proved to be very helpful 
189094,St George s Hotel Wembley, The tiny wash basin , The staff team was friendly The service was good I enjoyed the food I am likely to stay at the hotel in the future if and when I visit Wembley 
189095,St George s Hotel Wembley, Used condom on the floor Dirty hard tube socks in the wardrobe Uncleanliness of beds Free toiletries were only filled once during our five night six day stay Had to change rooms due to it being so dirty as some pictures show and had to ask Took the bin down with the rubbish to show the manager and that we were not impressed and they cleaned the bin and bought it back the staff member that did so did not say anything to us Did not ask if there was anything else just walked out Staff were not seem very happy nor did they talk to us only in another language which is fine but a very unwelcoming feeling when we cannot understand what they are saying , When we finally had our room changed after an hour and going down to the desk twice 
189096,St George s Hotel Wembley, The hotel was a bit far from the center of London and the breakfast was somewhat simple Nevertheless this was a very nice and highly recommended hotel I would return again and I would recommend it , The room is really comfortable It even had a TV in the bath Highly recommended

189098,St George s Hotel Wembley, Parking wasn t reserved Apparently you have to telephone them no good putting ina request in the booking com form It also didn t mention they only have parking for 13 cars until after I d gone through the whole malarkey of booking I assumed parking would be 10 but they charged me 25 because there was a band on in the arena What difference should that make Try stopping close by if you re in a car Not much fun Breakfast was included I thought It turned out only continental I would have to pay around 8 on top for the full breakfast , Standard nice hotel next to the stadium 
189099,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, Lovely welcoming friendly staff superb room and cleanliness Breakfast was lovely Location is bang on for Wembley arena the London designer outlet Amazing hotel staff Will definitely be returning

189104,St George s Hotel Wembley, Very basic breakfast for English breakfast 5 extra was charged , Tv in the bathroom modern room and comfortable bed Coffee and tea facilities in the room 
189105,St George s Hotel Wembley, Continental breakfast in England the reason why continental people like English breakfasts is because they re English not continental We got some eggs and bacon but had to pay extra I d rather see an increased room rate with English breakfast included , Nice hotel if you need to be at Wembly or SSE Wembley arena George at reception gave us an upgrade at arrival and welcomed us in a very friendly way Room was superb clean big modern good Wifi Bar tender was super friendly as well 
189106,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, Staff were very helpful and polite no problems getting into room room facilities were to a very high standard breakfast was delivered at good timing and quality
189107,St George s Hotel Wembley, Only that there was insufficient Tea and milk in my room and no biscuits at all provided with the refreshments not the norm for a 4 star hotel , Room was of outstanding quality and comfort even though the hotel is new and has only been open a few weeks according to the lady Receptionist Parking is secure but very limited and on a first come first gets basis so glad I reserved a space when booking and only 10 GBP per night The Italian style meals are very tasty as was breakfast In my opinion I consider it excellent value for money and worthy of a higher rating just as long as they don t increase their prices 
189108,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, Excellent location for the SSE Arena all staff were professional and friendly great room with high standard of decor and fittings loved the balcony and light aircon panel by bed

189113,St George s Hotel Wembley, The bathroom door wouldnt lock that was only issue I didnt bother with it but another person may have I let reception know Think because it was a new hotel the door just wasnt fully aligned , You upgraded us to an executive room for no reason It was amazing service 
189114,St George s Hotel Wembley, Room a little cold and we couldn t work the heating Phoned down to reception who said after 10mins will heat up and it did , Very impressed with our room Especially the touch light switch Although we couldn t get the under flooring heating working Loved the fact there was a TV in the bathroom water in the fridge tea coffee and milk in the fridge Will definitely book here again 
189115,St George s Hotel Wembley, 25 to park my car for the night is too expensive When checking in the reception staff answered the phone so I didn t think they gave me full attention , Close proximity to Wembley stadium retail outlet Very clean Everything automated in the room like light switches air con heater No interruptions from housekeeping Very comfy single beds TV in the bathroom A nice choice of food in the hotel restaurant given a 20 discount voucher on check in The pizza was very good Breakfast although only continental was included in the rate 
189116,St George s Hotel Wembley, Thought the payment of 75 for 3 days to park the car was a bit steep seeing that we were staying there not experienced that before , Close Wembly and shops staff lovely 
189117,St George s Hotel Wembley, It was over priced and breakfast wasnt good no hot selection at all and they said it was english breakfast, I liked how it looked in general nothing was really wrong just it felt like i was in a block i could hear everyone in the hall
189118,St George s Hotel Wembley, The only critisism i had is that i couldn t eat in the resteraunt and have it charged to my business I m an employee without a credit card and although my boss booked and paid for the room over the internet any extra s couldn t be charged to the same card without a form being filled out and signed by my boss and a copy of the front and back of the actual credit card Surely a call from my boss to pay over the phone like you can anywhere else would have been fine Like i said this is the only problem i had everything else was really good , Great clean hotel Great location and easy transport links Very good price also

189121,St George s Hotel Wembley, View of wembley stadium we saw about 20 feet of the arch through 2 other hotels Site sold the view as being a lot better , Staff were pleasant and helpful Room was spotless when first entering Location was very good for the reason I was staying closeness to wembley arena Breakfast was very nice

189124,St George s Hotel Wembley, No drop off point for loading unloading taxi No concierge service Payment required upfront and therefore no ability to cancel prepaid breakfast which I would not recommend for the price Only milk available for coffee vs creamer bedding was polyester blend and itchy The towels at Ibis across the street were softer , Location was prima Staff outstanding and free WiFi 
189125,St George s Hotel Wembley, Food was ok but nothing special in the restaurant Didn t like the half shower curtain glass , The integration of technology in the room made everything very convenient and comfortable 
189126,St George s Hotel Wembley, The miserable young female receptionist with dark hair Eastern European with a distinct accent needs to go on a customer service course or not be behind the front desk To this lady Try smiling and not being confrontational with your guests Try not to keep them waiting more than 3 minutes while you finish your previous inventory job or just ask them to hold on a minute WITH A SMILE You forgot to make our keys live so we had to come down to you again to get them activated you looked most annoyed You forgot to give us the free wifi code and again you made us come down to you to collect them can t understand why someone couldn t have come up to see our room You made absolutely no effort to talk to us or even smile when we arrived engage with your customers it really helps Everything seemed to be an effort Even when we asked about the room requests we had made you looked sourly at us and said yes of course why Really , Room was very modern and had all the high tech spec you needed to make this a great business and leisure venue You couldn t hear other people s tv or voices in the room so good sound proofing The staff in the bar were very pleasant and helpful and had a really good rapport with guests I d definitely recommend this hotel but change your Eastern European Receptionist she let s you down

189142,St George s Hotel Wembley, My only negative was even though the finish seemed to be to a high spec One of the plug sockets wasn t wired in and fell of the wall it was a main plus along the desk so you would think that would be the one you d ensure actually worked , The hotel was great value in an ideal location and had a lovely welcome area Hopefully here to stay in Wembley and I m sure with time will exceed its current situation The room was lovely and a great size the bathroom was also a great surprise 
189143,St George s Hotel Wembley, After I have paid by cash the staff charge my credit card again and guest must pay the deposit 50 by credit card when check in considerably far from the tube station unless go to metro by bus 20minutes to tube station by walking breakfast very low and poor , High quality room and facilities

189153,St George s Hotel Wembley, Considering that everything else was so amazing the size of the towels in the bathroom were too small Not everyone is a size 10 so larger bath towels would be good I would recommend booking the hotel inclusive of breakfast thankfully we did as the cost is 19 each and the choice of continental breakfast is not too wide, A brand new hotel with the most modern of technology Everything was on a touch pad lights air conditioning fan etc The bedroom was spacious with the most confortable beds fridge safe and a HUGE television sad we did not get time to watch it The bathroom was amazing with a brilliant shower The service was first class from the reception staff to the bar and restaurant staff For those visiting Wembley Stadium it is directly across the road If I am visiting London again I would definitely book here again

189165,St George s Hotel Wembley, Price of extras was ridiculous, The hotel was amazing However we were not woken up on checkout as we had overslept The staff called us at 3 30pm to let us know So we ended paying an extra 40 On top of 25 parking which is an absoloute rip off considering how much you pay for the room and room service was extortionate 
189166,St George s Hotel Wembley, The location isn t that bad just that it seems to be made out that it overlooks the stadium when there are other buildings in the way , Went for my other halfs birthday it was amazing How helpful everyone was at the hotel how clean value for money Everything couldn t have been better

189177,St George s Hotel Wembley, Was originally allocated a room which was occupied next room key did not work, The upgraded room given very impressed staff accomodating very clean throughout
189178,St George s Hotel Wembley,No Negative, The proximity of the hotel to Wembley Stadium as we were there solely for the Rugby World Cup New Zealand v Argentina As we were staying at the hotel after the match we decided to eat at there The restaurant was packed with supporters from the match all wanting to eat and drink There was only one waitress taking orders clearing tables serving food Her name was Mirela from Romania and she was a STAR She kept everyone happy and always a smile on her face 
189179,St George s Hotel Wembley, The woman who booked us in didn t tell us anything ie what floor our room was on breakfast house keeping and house keeping letting me know themselves in our room early hrs of the morning, Loved the room all upto date with all mod cons and the location is brilliant near a fantastic designer shopping outlet and cinema

189183,St George s Hotel Wembley, Firstly the walk from the tube station to the hotel is not described correctly as it is probably a 20min walk WhenI got to the hotel I was informed that the hotel had a system error and that they did not receive my booking and subsequently cancelled my booking Apparently they tried calling me 7 times that morning but could not get a hold of me as my cell number number was incorrect however they failed to use the South African dialed code Staff and manager in particluar were rude and unhelpful had to sit in the hotel lobby for 3 hours trying to find alternate accomodation What was strange is that this occurred to other guests as well who used a booking agent to make their booking so was this just a way of the hotel trying not to pay commission to these agents by taking only direct booking ,No Positive
189184,St George s Hotel Wembley, Nothing, The hotel was lovely you couldn t have asked for a nicer place are room was exactly like the picture the staff were very nice Location didn t matter as we re not afraid of using the tubes 12 10
