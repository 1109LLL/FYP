239744,Hotel Mademoiselle, maybe just pop another mirror in the main bedroom near a plug so can style hair better , the staff were ALL lovely and really helpful and welcoming and very natural with it the decor was fabulous and the beds were the most comfortable ever and we travel many times per year so they were the best breakfast was great and the dining and lounge very comfortable will stay again 
239745,Hotel Mademoiselle, This district of Paris is dirty but can t blame the hotel , 5 min walk from Gare du Nord Friendly staff Attractively decorated hotel Very welcoming Free coffee on the patio Good breakfast
239746,Hotel Mademoiselle, Mix up on final account and was given in french , Cute hotel small clean functional good enough breakfast options ok location walked from train station with luggage secure property 
239747,Hotel Mademoiselle, The area around the hotel and the station didn t make me feel comfortable in going out alone in the evening Luckily there is an excellent restaurant next to the hotel There is no minibar in the room only water , Nicely decorated hotel with a Parisian feel Very conveniently located near the Gare du Nord I loved the litlle terrace in my room with view on the parisian rooftops Bed was good so was the rainshower and other amenities All in all a nice address in Paris when travelling by train 
239748,Hotel Mademoiselle, Wi fi connection very intermittent and not stable but overall a lovely and well run hotel, The bedding and overall comfort of the hotel and cleanliness was brilliant could not fault a thing 
239749,Hotel Mademoiselle, Better communication at the front desk telling us what the hotel had to offer and may the area as most people were tired and hungry in the waiting area , Not particularly welcoming when we arrived Traveling internationally on a night flight you arrive late morning in the hotel and of course can t check in until late afternoon It would be nice to have a cheerful welcome when you arrive There lounge area is not very comfortable and several guests were waiting for their rooms and sleeping in the lobby area sitting on uncomfortable dark space They did have coffee available in the back but no one actually pointed that out to us I fortunately was not one of the people sleeping and walked the neighborhood but should have walked in the opposite direction because one area is much better than the other Very close to one of the train stations but unfortunately not the train station we had to go to the next day and the taxi was very pricey due to the distance and the usual Paris traffic Room and bathroom were very clean but also very small but the price was right 
239750,Hotel Mademoiselle, The coffee machines in the lounge and bistro The breakfast coffee machine ran out of coffee a blessing because the brewed coffee replacement was far more to my liking The location was a 15 20Euro Taxi ride to the centre of Paris Cheap because of the P H However the Metro was close by , The staff were very good and mostly spoke excellent understandable English The room was garret style but French charming with a view on the surrounding chimneys Otherwise pokey but comfortable and clean The district arr 10 near Gare du Nord was a bit impoverished and with a mix of cultures but seemed quite safe although we were there on a public holiday 
239751,Hotel Mademoiselle, Sent an email prior to stay asking about the gym facilities Hotel staff confirmed me that there was a treadmill and free weights Upon arrival I find out treadmill isn t working and weights were very limited When telling someone from staff that treadmill wasn t working the reply was a shrug and a so what face Wished staff were upfront about the limitations of the gym such that I could ve made arrangements finding a local gym or bringing my own training gear to not miss my training Might not be important to them but it is to me , Great breakfast superb food Room was extremely comfortable for a Paris hotel in which rooms tend to be TINY bed was excellent Shower with great pressure 
239752,Hotel Mademoiselle, Very noisy room not soundproof and next to lift Lift made a noise going up and down and heard people talk all evening Bathroom rediculous small You need to bend under the basin to sit under toilet If I was overweight I would not be able to use it, Breakfast excellent
239753,Hotel Mademoiselle,No Negative, Loved the decor comfortable beds lower level spa is perfect with sauna hydrotherapy and more Breakfast included everything we could have wanted open air as well as indoor seating area Staff were excellent Pleasantly surprised this hotel exceeded all of our expectations Highly recommend a visit 
239754,Hotel Mademoiselle, We were completely satisfied , We pre booked a single night at Hotel Mademoiselle as an extension of our visit because the original location didn t have that night However the original didn t work out so we also booked the 4 other nights at the last minute actually on the way to the hotel From the moment we booked to the time we left the staff was not only always available to accommodate but offered solutions and suggestions For example since we booked at last minute we would have had to move twice during our stay because there wasn t a single room for the entire time They shifted other reservations without inconvenience to other guests had us wait a couple extra hours to check in and gave us one room for the entire time They also offered complimentary coffee and snacks while we waited Since this was our first visit to Paris we had many questions and requests Every staff member from the front desk to housekeeping was pleasant patient and always helpful Sandra front end worked out the room and gave us suggestions for food galleries and markets Celina also front end was very pleasant attentive informative and helpful We aren t exactly sure what Anthony s title is because he was always assisting us with so many different things He made sure that we were always attended to and lacked for nothing Antoine worked the front end at night along with Laura helped us through a Wi Fi issue and offered suggestions for restaurants in the area accurate by the way Last but not least Gamini served and assisted us for our breakfasts His recommendations were spot on When we return to Paris we intend to stay here again Well worth it and conveniently located near the train stations 
239755,Hotel Mademoiselle, I had a room on the sixth floor The corridors smell There is no lift to the 6th floor The room was tiny and stuffy I travel approximately 100 nights out of the year This hotel was a huge disappointment I simply cannot understand how it scores so highly This hotel claiming it is 4 star is simply a lie This at best qualifies as a budget hotel , Convenient location for Gare du Nord
239756,Hotel Mademoiselle, The room was small for 2 people not much space , The interior design of the hotel is very nice and adorable The staff are very kind and helpful too Good location too Special mention to Anthony for being very kind and helpful 
239757,Hotel Mademoiselle, In the bathroomthey have a glass door that only covers 1 2 the shower Bathroom remodel is excellent besides that Also Ihad some difficulty turning it to shower by pulling the plug on the faucet still great long lasting hot water super clean Wish I could have taken a hot bath during my stay , The staff and spa were phenomenal Gets extra hot
239758,Hotel Mademoiselle, Aircon was not working in one room and the smell in the room was not good But we were moved to another room the following day Location far away from most of the happenings in Paris , Breakfast very nice Staff accommodating 
239759,Hotel Mademoiselle, The rooms are less fancy than expected on the pictures on booking com The rooms are small and the although the rooms are fine the quality of the materials used in furniture and decoration are somewhat less than expected good fotography The breakfast is OK but in the weekend there was not enough space for every guest to be seated The place was crowded too hot and busy staff however was very friendly It was better on monday , Very good location friendly staff and kids could run around free and use the gym to play rooms were OK but less fancy than expected location near the Gare du Nord is perfect quiet location and some very good and very French restaurants and bars nearby 
239760,Hotel Mademoiselle, Leaving the room key card at reception each time you walk out was a bit odd , Stayed in the smaller room and bathroom was small but very nice Comfortable bed Clean facilities Good value for money Very close to both Gare du Nord and Gare de l est 
239761,Hotel Mademoiselle, Breakfast was packed and the staff was moving very quickly just to keep up so there was a delay in eating as they refilled and a line for most things The hotel is very close to the train station and the neighborhood around is just ok If you are looking for the elegant higher en d neighborhood this may not be it It does change dramatically from one block to the next We did not metro home at night because of this and took a cab instead, Very eclectic property that is well thought out with the use of space Our rooms were comfortable and the hotel made an effort to put our room next to our children since adjoining was not available Chocolates robes and slippers awaiting our arrival in the room The location is a 5 minute walk from the train station 
239762,Hotel Mademoiselle, Walls very thin TV are directly mounted on the walls Last night of stay had to call desk to ask neighbor to turn down TV Could hear entire TV show , Convenient location and friendly helpful staff Hotel is on a fairly quiet street too within a block of cafes grocery store bakery and metro stop 
239763,Hotel Mademoiselle,No Negative, Our stay was just perfect Beautiful hotel big and cosy room We were upgraded to the most beautiful room in the hotel We were even able to see the Eiffel Tower from the second room and the bathroom Thank you so much for that We highly recommend this Hotel And we would love to come back 
239764,Hotel Mademoiselle, Wish that you could specify exact room type ie Twin not double Had a delay on arrival as double prepared and we needed a twin , Very helpful staff and great location for Metro Exactly what we needed for a sightseeing hotel as 2 major Metro stations within a 5 min walk 
239765,Hotel Mademoiselle, The Hotel is dated It could use a Remake over with new bright paint and some new furnishings They could use also brighten up the Lobby area with some bright lights and furnishings When first arriving it is dark and not to welcoming , The Location is perfect if you Need to use the Metro and Long distant Train System The breakfast was good but they could use more variety in the selection of items available The spa is also a very nice Feature The Hotel Staff is very friendly and helpful 
239766,Hotel Mademoiselle, Had to leave key with lobby when going out The amenities and room are a bit dirty and aged Elevators a bit shady, Had a spa with a nice sauna but limited to use for only 30 minutes per person or couple Location was okay Staff was nice and friendly
239767,Hotel Mademoiselle, The room got a strange smell from some kind of deodorizer , The location is great very close to Gare du Nord and Gare de l Est but in a quite street The staff is extremely friendly and accomodating The rooms are nice bed comfortable and bath reasonably for a small French hotel There are two nice rooms in the ground floor to meet 
239768,Hotel Mademoiselle, The room was highlighted by Booking com as an extra special price reduced by 100 EUR per night At that price i was expecting a really good room spacious at least But this was not the case the room was tiny with a really small bathroom Really puzzling who would be prepared to pay the full price for that room I don t know how these special offer are managed or who makes those decisions but i will be very vary of them in future Also worth checking with the hotel directly as apparently I could have had the breakfast for free Be very vary of special offers on Booking com Always check with hotel directly as well if you can , Cute breakfast area nice little inner courtyard Nicely decorated rooms good bed 
239769,Hotel Mademoiselle, Mattress was a little on the hard side no bathroom mats floor got wet and slippy , Cheese for breakfast what more could you want lovely decor and very clean We were lucky enough to get a room with a balcony lovely romantic getaway 
239770,Hotel Mademoiselle, Typical of an older Paris hotel the hallway was so narrow that I couldn t take both of my suitcases at once to my room Also the neighbourhood is really seedy and I would not be walking alone by myself especially as a single woman anywhere around there , The room was modern and clean and the bathroom was really nice and all new The bed was comfortable and they provided complimentary robes and slippers There was a very good restaurant right next store 
239771,Hotel Mademoiselle, The noise insolation is not very performant but it didn t really bothered us We had some issues with the Internet connection but in general the stay was very pleasant , Good situation nice and well decorated rooms The service is friendly and professional the bedding is high quality 
239772,Hotel Mademoiselle, staff look sad and not hepfing mutc wen we com inn late and dey have to open the dore 2 times dey seem angry and to eat food tere in morning cost extra verry expensive 15 Euro per person and room was so smal and i have to pay somting call city tax somting i never do bifoure at anny hotel way to expensive all , Room and hotel was cleen and bed was good
239773,Hotel Mademoiselle,No Negative, I loved this stay nevertheless it was only one day The hotel is well maintained and stylish Small details in the room are funny and makes it cozy Everything what you can expect in 4 star hotel was there The lobby with books big TV and very good coffee makes your stay even more pleasant Staff was perfect I would like to come back 
239774,Hotel Mademoiselle,No Negative, Small but very comfortable room with modern bathroom and decor Close to station so easy to get just about anywhere Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff Lovely breakfast room and lounge with all day tea and coffee facilities
239775,Hotel Mademoiselle, Small room They did a good job using the space but nevertheless it s a physical constraint in the structure , The property attended both big matters and small so many details were well done The hotel had a well decorated and comfortable living room Location close to gare du nord Usable desk Good internet 
239776,Hotel Mademoiselle,No Negative, Good location great facilities in the hotel and friendly staff The hotel has a relaxed feel and space to chill out a lounge the spa area etc It s a good place for couples 
239777,Hotel Mademoiselle, The hot food buffet was cold the heater wasn t working properly the boiled eggs were cold , Friendly helpful reception staff Good continental breakfast spread Kettle in dining room so tea was very hot 
239778,Hotel Mademoiselle, Expensive But you pay for what you get and you get it all here If I was being picky I would say there could be more healthy options on the menu but when we asked the kitchen created a few dishes so can t complaun, Pure luxury from start to finish and attentive staff who went out of there way to hekp
239779,Hotel Mademoiselle, Breakfast included rather than extra We had great croissant and coffee for much less on the way to the station , Very comfortable bed great bath Spacious and a somewhat distant view of the Eiffel Tower Stylish modern room
239780,Hotel Mademoiselle, shower room no door curtain must carefully to do the shower to avoid splashing everywhere, Location quit good near Gare de Nord Gare du Est and the metro station Friendly Staff Cozy room
239781,Hotel Mademoiselle,No Negative, The hotel was very comfortable and the staff was very helpful with helping me out with my situation If coming or going by train the location is excellent 
239782,Hotel Mademoiselle, Unfortunately the area around the location no longer feels safe There are a lot of people hanging around Gare de Nord who are there to try and rob you We almost became victims ourselves at Gare de Nord , The service and helpfulness of the staff was excellent The rooms were always clean and tidy 
239783,Hotel Mademoiselle,No Negative, Amazing attentive staff at reception our French isnt very good but they helped us instead with their fantastic fluent English The bed was so comfortable room was clean pretty and quiet I d highly recommend to everyone Merci beaucoup 
239784,Hotel Mademoiselle, Still looking for something , Close to the Gare du Nord Station Quiet street Very clean rooms Excellent service Rooms on the 6th floor are very nice and quiet 
239785,Hotel Mademoiselle,No Negative, Everything was just right Location wise was one of the best staff were professional and always has their smile on and gave the required help when asked The room was clean and comfy spa was outstanding I believe the only issue that should be looked after is the wifi connection which was poor speed wise Staff and management recommended great restaurants You will get everything you are looking for around the hotel starting from a supermarket ending with luxury cafes and restaurants 
239786,Hotel Mademoiselle, Once you got off the hotel street the area became very busy and not so nice although convenient for the station , The staff were very helpful and the facilities and room size were very good Overal this was an excellent hotel 
239787,Hotel Mademoiselle, Unfortunately there wasn t hotel porter to carry our luggages , The hotel is lovely clean and stylish Lovely hotel newly renovated Very clean and close to train and metro Staffs are nice The hotel is 8 minutes walking distance to Gare du Nord Free wifi there is an A C in the room 
239788,Hotel Mademoiselle, Nothing, The staff seemed disinterested in me as a customer The stair well I was directed to to access my room smelt terrible I wish I d stayed at my previous hotel in Paris which was infinitely better friendlier better value for money and cleaner 
239789,Hotel Mademoiselle, The tub is lovely but there needs to be an attachment on the wall to hold the water hose so that it can be used as a shower In this day and age people don t take baths they shower in a hotel unless they have small children Adults want a shower The staff was great , Loved the room Top floor and a view of the Eiffel Tower 
239790,Hotel Mademoiselle, Despite the room upgrade there was no holder for the shower in our bathroom so despite the mugginess of the day in Paris we were unable to shower and had to take a time consuming bath instead We struggled to turn on the tv and hairdryer in the morning and had to call for help multiple times 6 7 in fact and when the gentleman came up to help everything worked straightforwardly I think he flicked the fuse on the way up but didn t say this he just made it look like we had been doing it wrong I felt this was patronising and rude but not worth taking up at the time or at all as it didn t exactly affect our stay hugely, The staff were super friendly and the location was perfect for our quick one night visit to Paris travelling in and out on the Eurostar A very short walk from gare du nord and in fact walking distance from everywhere we didn t use the metro once The hotel upgraded our room and it was simple spacious and lovely The hotel has a pretty courtyard for drinks I would recommend this hotel highly for a quick stop over in this beautiful city 
239791,Hotel Mademoiselle, Room can be stuffy hot at night but that s common to many European hotels , Excellent location close to train stations Gare du Nord Gare de L Est and right next door to St Antoine food market Spacious room by Paris standards and quiet 
239792,Hotel Mademoiselle, Before we travelled we checked the website to make sure no fois gras However when we got there it was on the menu Had we known we would never have booked Room was small with a small leak in bathroom ceiling No bar and lounge was being used as staff room , Location and staff 
239793,Hotel Mademoiselle, Just to continue to maintain such an excellent hotel , Everything about this hotel is excellent not least its proximity to Gare du Nord the lovely modern boutique feel comfortable beds warm quiet and good food
239794,Hotel Mademoiselle,No Negative, Hotels around Gare du Nord aren t normally great but I have to say this hotel was excellent Great location close to Eurostar terminal friendly staff comfortable rooms and a great breakfast I couldn t fault it
239795,Hotel Mademoiselle, WiFi could have been better We kept losing signal in our room during our stay , It was nice getting two bathrobes and slippers for us to use Room and bed was comfortable Location close to Metro 
239796,Hotel Mademoiselle, The hotel was super busy so I wasn t able to check in early and I thought that check out was quite early as well Staff sometimes seemed flustered because there were so many people , Location was great since it was close to the Gare du Nord and we came in on the Eurostar Free coffee in the lounge Great shower though because of its setup I managed to soak the whole bathroom Blackout curtains we slept in late We only spent one night there but thought it was comfortable convenient and really nice 
239797,Hotel Mademoiselle, nothing big It was a bit warm in the room , The staff were very friendly the facilities were quite nice like the complimentary spa coffee and coco machine and a hangout room for guests Had a great stay and will definitely go again 
239798,Hotel Mademoiselle, We had to open window during the night as room was stuffy fortunately it was quiet and we weren t disturbed Room quite small but still good value , The room was comfy and quiet Excellent location close to the Gard due Nord The staff were very friendly and helpful They helped us find a vegan restaurant and also lent me a plug adapter 
239799,Hotel Mademoiselle, Didn t have breakfast due to the cost Although there was a lovely cafe about 2 mins walk away, We had a Junior suite which was quite roomy even with the extra bed Shower really good Really close to Gard Du Nord which was extremely convenient
239800,Hotel Mademoiselle, Room was too warm no air conditioning available No fan in toilet odour from same, Hotel comfortable Staff were friendly Bed was comfortable Breakfast very good
239801,Hotel Mademoiselle, No complaints We had a minor problem with the sink when it couldn t be repaired they gave us another room Right answer , GREAT location close to Gare de l Est and Nord Spotlessly clean Nice breakfast Plenty of pillows towels and toilet paper 
239802,Hotel Mademoiselle, Location of the hotel is not great Although close to bare du more there s nothing much else around it , The staff is very nice and helpful The room is large and clean
239803,Hotel Mademoiselle, Our initial room smelt of smoke we were moved to another I had requested a later check out time weeks before we arrived and when I approached a member of staff about this he was quite rude and said it didn t matter even when I showed him the email The shower overflowed into the bathroom and the maintenance man who came to fix it walked straight into the room without knocking ,No Positive
239804,Hotel Mademoiselle, Wooden floors scrapping chair and pacing heels from above really annoying Hotels must pad chair feet if they want the easy option of wooden floors , Nice breakfast and bathroom was good 
239805,Hotel Mademoiselle, perhaps a mini bar in the bedroom , free tea and coffee facilities downstairs and area to relax is great room so clean with two beds pushed together giving lots of room fantastic shower large flat screen tv good selection at breakfast staff so helpful polite and courteous I have mobility problems and the staff in particular at breakfast were so helpful in bringing me food and drink I hardly had to lift a finger 
239806,Hotel Mademoiselle, Being close to the train station also means the area was a little rougher and dirtier than I would have liked especially walking home at night with my children , Modern fun stylish decor Lots of bright light Huge bed Location to the Eurostar train station was perfect for our needs 
239807,Hotel Mademoiselle, N A, The hotel had a nice cosy feel with lovely d cor tucked away in a little side street just five minutes walk from Gare du Nord Breakfast was delicious and plentiful Staff were very pleasant and helpful too 
239808,Hotel Mademoiselle, Dissapointed the spa was only open from 16 30 23 00 as we didn t get to use it But not a big deal as only there for long weekend , Lovely decor friendly staff very helpful ordering taxi s and giving directions around Paris The breakfast was nice too 
239809,Hotel Mademoiselle, Overall hotel was clean but the outside of toilet had blood from pervious guest which I didn t appreciate could have been cleaned better by staff, Everything was good
239810,Hotel Mademoiselle, Cleaning of the rooms above us started really early in the morning 06 30 and continued for about an hour We woke up from the noise It started again from 09 30 Don t expect to get much sleep only book if you re an early riser , Great room great bed everything is quite new 
239811,Hotel Mademoiselle, I really can t think of anything , The hotel was very well looked after and appointed It was exceptionally clean and staff went out of their way to be helpful and friendly Breakfast was plentiful fresh and French as we wanted 
239812,Hotel Mademoiselle, A fire alarm went off during the night No explanation from management as to what was happening , Very close to the Eurostar clean and good value a rare find in paris which tends to be overpriced and low quality 
239813,Hotel Mademoiselle, Not unsafe but better watch out at night on nearby streets , Nice and helpful staff Love the trendy design of the hotel Just 5 min walk from Gare du nord Gare du l Est and Possionnaire easy access to a number of metro lines and tourist spots 
239814,Hotel Mademoiselle, Bed way too firm gave me bad back and I like a firm bed Pillows too puffy should have a mixture of thicknesses instead of 4 huge feather pillows Lot s of people are allergic to feathers Interior once off the ground floor is not as good as the foyer , Location great nice foyer and staff
239815,Hotel Mademoiselle, Booking com more expensive than booking direct with hotel as breakfast extra with booking com but included in price with direct booking , Excellent housekeeping staff Room extremely well cleaned each day Very comfortable and large bed Excellent breakfast which is included in room price if booked directly through hotel Good choice and quality from buffet Friendly and helpful staff at reception Convenient location for Gare du Nord and Gare de l Est Good restaurants in area opposite Gare du Nord and in neighbourhood towards centre of Paris 
239816,Hotel Mademoiselle, Quite a let down This could be a great place but 1 Front desk staff made absolutely NO effort to allow me to check in a couple of hours early and could obviously not care less If I wanted a motel type of service I would go to a cheap motel and pay the price of a cheap motel 2 Very poor sound proofing I could follow the same TV program as next door s neighbour until 1 am while trying to sleep though 3 Black mould in shower is unacceptable in a 4 star hotel ,No Positive
239817,Hotel Mademoiselle, No complaints, 5 minutes walk from Gare Du Nord clean if somewhat small room plenty of fresh towels dressing gowns Modern bathroom good shower nice staff Perfect 
239818,Hotel Mademoiselle, Wifi was a bit intermittent , Really friendly and helpful staff in desk accommodated an early arrival and looked after our luggage on our last day we had the junior suite which was a brilliant size the room was clean decor lovely beds so comfortable with two pillows each dressing gowns slippers breakfast buffet was also great with friendly staff Couldn t recommend it enough 
239819,Hotel Mademoiselle, Wifi connection was terrible everywhere in the hotel Unusable and very frustrating , Good location for those making connections at Gare du Nord or Gare L Est walking distance to Montmarte Opera Galleries Lafayette etc well kept and well decorated
239820,Hotel Mademoiselle, small room poor quality decor needing updating very cramped breakfasting room with unnecessary large television on although variety of foods available for breakfast poor quality over priced, friendly accomodating staff good location
239821,Hotel Mademoiselle, We were in a top floor 6th room and it was a bit small with the slope of the roof reducing part of the headroom Just about okay for the three nights we were there , The hotel was conveniently situated for access to Gare du Nord railway station being less than 10 minutes walk away but on a quiet side street admittedly our room was not overlooking the road The room was small clean with coffee making facilities in the room The en suite was clean with a good shower The staff were friendly and the breakfast choice was good If you are a coeliac there is a reasonable choice of food but do not order the bread as it is thick with a hard crust and muffin pikelet like consistency centre Do not be put off by the outside of the hotel as you approach it it is far better than it looks I will use it again on my next visit to Paris 
239822,Hotel Mademoiselle, The room was a bit darkish with a tiny bathroom , Comfy beds and bedding slept like a log Modern design clean very good location quiet good and quiet air con windows could be opened coffee tray
239823,Hotel Mademoiselle, Worst ever position Dangerous night and day Special security Surroundings worst suburbs Small rooms no elevator Cheap furniture, Breakfast complete although in a rough corridor Staff gentle but not well trained
239824,Hotel Mademoiselle, Room was very very small Literally not enough room to walk around the bed I know Paris is expensive but this is the outskirts 180 euro per night for a room this small is in my opinion not good value for money, Location was handy for rail station
239825,Hotel Mademoiselle, Ground floor room with big shower but no bath and next to the breakfast room so a little noisy in the morning, Great find if you want to be close to Gare du Nord Stylish comfortable 
239826,Hotel Mademoiselle, Our in room docking station was broken every time we had a shower the fire alarm went off due to no ventilation in the bathroom , Hotel staff were excellent and very friendly 
239827,Hotel Mademoiselle, There was some early morning traffic noise as I room overlooked the road on the second floor It did not effect me particularly but my wife wasn t too happy with this aspect Had we had a room at the back of the hotel I think things would be perfect , Although the hotel did not look brilliant outside inside was a different matter Room was clean and staff extremely friendly Hotel was close to Station du Nord so our late arrival about 1130 p m did not cause any problems Breakfasts were excellent and I would have no hesitation in returning and recommending it to others 
239828,Hotel Mademoiselle, Street view unattractive surrounding buildings a bit rundown Room small and cramped with two large suitcases , Very friendly staff very clean near new room furniture free coffee easy check in Safe in room Supplied electric kettle in room 
239829,Hotel Mademoiselle, Not really a 4 star hotel standard no bar fridge Pillow too high wifi not working most time and tv was not working 2 out of 3 nights we stayed , Good location friendly and helpful reception Water and chocolate was a pleasant welcome Expensive for the size of junior suite which was too small 
239830,Hotel Mademoiselle, We did have an issue which was dealt with poorly at the time Since our return home we been issued an apology which we have accepted , The hotel is extremely close to both Gare du Nord and Gare L Est which is very handy 
239831,Hotel Mademoiselle, Nothing to report, Good hotel for visiting Paris and to use as a base Good standards across the hotel spectrum Very comfortable and quite room great shower Good stay
