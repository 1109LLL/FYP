283712,Megaro Hotel, As said above the noise of the traffic , Staff very friendly Had to ask for 2 extra bath towels as only 2 initially provided Perfect location for King s Cross St Pancras comes at a price the traffic generated noise Excellent breakfast in attached restaurant Ideal for kids and a shower that works
283713,Megaro Hotel, Air conditioning controlled from reception First night too hot second night perfect , Great location opposite Kings Cross station Great access to the rest of London via tube 
283714,Megaro Hotel, Uncomfortable bed mattress on slats like a camp bed rooms are tired and worn Staff in restaurant unfriendly , Central location air con room breakfast good but no choice with full English came with scrambled egg Should have been fried 
283715,Megaro Hotel, The extraction fan is broken in the toilet The distance you have to drag cases to the apartment was a concern maybe 150 200m walk away from the hotel lobby to a completely different block of flats As this would be a daily issue for visitors why not have service like a golf buggy with trailer to get guests cases from A to B Hopefully something could be arranged for next time There were 3 of us in our party me my wife and our friend I would have thought our bedroom was going to be seperated from kitch lounge but unfortunetly not So each of us heard every toilet session every snore from our friend and visa versa NO privacy even with an appartment Be ok if you were sharing with kids but 3 adults , The Funky room appearance The shower was awesome Plenty of room in apartment All in all great with 2 minor issues and 1 major issue as mentioned below 
283716,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, The attention given to us E g We had an exceptional late arrival given to airport delay Welcomed at 3am in the morning And an early departure 4am Comfy bed Good service
283717,Megaro Hotel, Breakfast was not included even after room upgrade hotel is very much over priced for what it is but that s London , Room was generously spacious bright with very large bed Staff where very courteous and welcoming Hotel is ideally situated in good location and great for short stay 
283718,Megaro Hotel, Very noisy despite double glazing homeless and a lot of action outside especially on Friday night , Generous size rooms staff really trying to help close to Tube and trains including Eurostar 
283719,Megaro Hotel, Liked everything , Location is perfect for traveling around London by Tube Plenty of places to eat in Kings Cross Breakfast good value Exceptionally clean Staff helpful and friendly Apartment perfect for multiple nights in London 
283720,Megaro Hotel, Late night room service would be nice but understand why a small hotel can t keep kitchen staff on for occasional guests needing food after midnight , Great staff and prefect location for Kings X station Rooms very spacious for London Quiet
283721,Megaro Hotel, Shower leaked into room and awkwardly high bath side to climb over with no handrails , Spacious room overlooking stations Excellent large bed Excellent breakfast but portion of granola a tad small and who has it AFTER cooked breakfast 
283722,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, The staff were exceptional We were there for a wedding and a group of our friends came back to get changed in our room and the staff were incredibly accommodating and understanding We also had drinks in the restaurant downstairs while we were waiting who were great with such a big group of us

283724,Megaro Hotel, 1 room had old carpet We prefer no carpets for cleanliness , Very friendly and helpfull staff We forgot a jacket in a restaurant nearby After we left London the staff helped to get to the jacket at the restaurant and send it to our home Super kind and helpful 10 
283725,Megaro Hotel, Outside room 211 there was a floodlight on some plants which was unhelpful when trying to get to sleep And some early signs of the bathroom dating heavy usage around the wash basin , Staff mega welcoming and eager to help Big room with plenty of space to walk around Great location And a free umbrella to walk around with as it was raining pouring 
283726,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Nice slightly quirky hotel opposite King s Cross St Pancras super useful if you are catching Eurostar Nice decoration style outside as well and given the location not noisy as it could easily be 
283727,Megaro Hotel, even the windows are in high quality but the location is still not the most quiet for some people as it s right in front of the main road of King s Cross Station, Great location crossing to the King s Cross Station
283728,Megaro Hotel, The shower makes a mess when one uses it water all over the expresso machine takes a rocket scientist to use it that speaks Italian as the directions on machine were in Italian a simple coffee machine would have been adequate the room was pretty pricey for what one gets , The location to the underground train was great
283729,Megaro Hotel, The light in the room is too little so that I sat the bathroom to view and write something, The room is big enough Location is very convenience to go everywhere The staffs is nice 
283730,Megaro Hotel, Unfortunately the lift was out of order both in the evening and the next morning Having agreed to a room on the top 6th floor the climb for 2 rather ageing people was a bit much Help was on hand with our baggage The bathroom window has no blind and faces east so when the sun rose at 4 30 am it was as if someone had switched on a very bright light We had to improvise a curtain for it Annoying in the middle of the night , We travelled to and from King s Cross station so this is an excellent location The hotel is welcoming and relaxed Nicely appointed too Our room had a comfortable if smallish double bed Quiet as requested Breakfast which cost extra was excellent with lovely fresh fruit salad good coffee and great eggs benedict 
283731,Megaro Hotel, Nothing, Very nice quiet comfortable room at the back of the hotel Very spacious and powerful shower Staff efficient and friendly Very convenient for St Pancras and Kings Cross stations 
283732,Megaro Hotel, Very noisy with emergency vehicle sirens about every half hour Hotel wanted thirty pound per hour for early checking my plane landed at 5am Complicated electrical switches some were master switches only Needed help to work everything Could not even work the phone Only stayed because opposite Eurostar Would choose a chain hotel if needed the location again ,No Positive
283733,Megaro Hotel, Carpet in the room was easily soiled and detracted from the overall room appearance A different finish would improve the appearance and cleanliness , Comfortable room and bed Excellent staff Thoughtful touch of providing champagne as this was our 40th anniversary trip Great shower and bathroom and lots of shelves and storage space Fabulous location convenient to 2 train stations 
283734,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Wonderful service the staff behind the desk was so nice and helpful Wonderful room it felt very homely cosy and luxurious at the same time The location is absolutely perfect when you travel through king s cross st Pancras I very much enjoyed my stay here 
283735,Megaro Hotel, air conditioning not accurate and unable to control from within the room food in associated restaurant not cooked satisfactorily, Good sized room for 3 adults Easy access for transport facilities staff very helpful
283736,Megaro Hotel, We did little else than sleep and were not there long enough to dislike anything It s in a down at heel area and would be a poor choice for tourists I feel , we had arrived by train in St Pancras and were leaving early the next day on Eurostar so its situation across the road from the station was ideal 
283737,Megaro Hotel, Milk in fridge was just in date but off when opened first thing in the morning Room temperature was hard to control when we arrived it was very cold and when raised it got too hot, Staff location 
283738,Megaro Hotel, Nothing I can think of , Great location and one of the better styles hotels in the area Great staff and all round good experience On this trip I had some medical issues and was very well supported by the staff and I am very grateful 
283739,Megaro Hotel, Our room was spacious but could use a little refreshment of materials and finishes , The staff were outstanding and made this a very pleasant stay for us The location in Kings Cross is great 
283740,Megaro Hotel, On he hottest day of the year the air conditioning in my room was not working My query ref this was NOT dealt with correctly and as a result I had almost zero sleep I was not looked after properly having spent 200 00 repeat 200 00 on the room ,No Positive
283741,Megaro Hotel, No problems no moans , Having tried several other reasonably nearby hotels we now always stay at the Megaro when catching an early Eurostar For that purpose the location can t be beaten Staff are always friendly rooms are fine good value for money overall 
283742,Megaro Hotel, Flies in bathroom and room continuously rotten wood in bathroom worn bathroom fixtures worn carpets Overall look is badly worn , The location friendly staff and quality of restaurant food 
283743,Megaro Hotel, Only downside would be that the location is inevitably a little noisy but not a problem , Staff very helpful and personable Great location ease of transport links Room spacious and comfortable The food in the restaurant breakfast x 2 and diner was superb freshly cooked easily rival or better some very high end London hotels 
283744,Megaro Hotel, The rooms though visually attractive were quite badly thought out The bath was so high that when climbing in and out of it I had to practically jump onto the floor which was wet after a shower because the shower screen wasn t wide enough to keep the water in Leaping on one leg onto a wet tiled floor felt a bit dangerous and I nearly slipped several times this is an accident waiting to happen especially considering I am of average height and a shorter person would struggle even more Also the lighting in the room was really badly designed There were no side lights by the bed only lights set into the headboard which were extremely dim almost like night lights for children So I had to bring the desk lamp over to read by which then meant the rest of the room was very dark A floor lamp would help solve this problem but ideally the bedside lighting would be better too , We chose this property because of the location which was excellent and very convenient I guess the price reflects this convenience really The decor is very attractive and the one breakfast we ate in the hotel was excellent Also I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet the room was despite the hotel being in such a busy location 
283745,Megaro Hotel, The service automatically added and all breakfast courses arriving at the same time Noisy aircon , Convenience for Eurostar and very good evening meal in restaurant
283746,Megaro Hotel, The only problems that I had was the safe in the room wasn t working and the remote control for the TV was somewhat tempremental , Location and service are amazing
283747,Megaro Hotel, Traffic noise in room was very loud when trying to get to sleep could do with more soundproofing , Staff were very helpful and friendly Restaurant was excellent and breakfast was good value
283748,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Great location easy walk across the road to St Pancras King s Cross Excellent staff friendly efficient Comfy bed good in room facilities We didn t eat at the restaurant but when we walked through it to the bar downstairs it was busy lively and the food looked super The bar was lovely cosy again with excellent staff 
283749,Megaro Hotel, Nothing I don t like about it maybe it would be nice if they have a washing machine for the laundry , Bed is comfortable but a bit small Nice apartment at excellent location easy to get around places as the metro and train stations are nearby Supplies at bathroom and kitchen are reasonable 
283750,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location for both local travel by train bus or walking 5 minutes only to St Pancras and Kings Cross stations Easy walking distance to the British Library excellent restaurants 
283751,Megaro Hotel, Nothing it was great , Hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful Whoever cleaned my room kept things nice and tidy every day I enjoyed the humor of the signages in the room 
283752,Megaro Hotel, Apart from restaurant very little family public space Hotel Bar was very cool but not appropriate for children , Funky spacious bright room Bathroom accessories Fresh milk Proximity to King s Cross St Pancras stations Friendly staff 
283753,Megaro Hotel, The heated towel rack wasn t working and hot water was very mild Not enough to deter me staying again if I am in town , The restaurant was fantastic I have many dietary requirements and they worked with me and served delicious food best in the UK The serving staff were also brilliant as was the front desk Best check in smiley happy beyond helpful and I have stayed at 7 hotels throughout the UK in the past two weeks You were the best hands down The room was amazing so well thought out The toiletries were also lovely 
283754,Megaro Hotel, We had a flight overseas at 1400hours and asked for a late check out We were granted this but advised a 10 pounds hour charge would apply which is a bit ridiculous I understand if it is peak season and the room is booked however this was not the case We ve stay in 5 star hotels Four Seasons Fairmont and Westin and we have never been charged an hourly rate We stayed for an extra hour and half and was charged accordingly kinda crazy , The front desk staff were excellent She kindly walked us over to the train and walked us through purchasing tickets to Heathrow She went over and above to ensure we were headed in the right direction and purchase the correct tickets Also we had checked in at midnight from a flight from Africa we were very tired and hungry and the front desk directed us to a take out place hotel restaurant was closed down the road They were very accommodating in letting us eat in the hotel restaurant 
283755,Megaro Hotel, Parking was difficult which we knew ahead of time and the hotel website is very clear about that , Upon check in we were advised we were being upgraded We got a lovely spacious room with views over St Pancras 
283756,Megaro Hotel, The square toilet was the worst very uncomfortable There was no shower in the room only a bathtub I had to take a bath 8 days in a row No top sheet on the bed just a comforter and fitted sheet kind of gross , Location is super close to Kings Cross which connects everywhere 
283757,Megaro Hotel, So much noise from the road meant for a sleepless night despite requesting quiet rooms when booking which would put us off staying again , Very friendly helpful staff Nice funky hotel great coffee machine in rooms 
283758,Megaro Hotel, I did not try room service or on site restaurant Sky tv was frustrating with very few choices, Great location near train and tube This is a nice quirky hotel Good choice if you don t want a chain hotel feel Room was nice and clean Received a free upgrade I only stayed one night but this seemed like a hotel and location that would be very suitable for a week visiting London 
283759,Megaro Hotel, This was our second stay and this time the room was a little smaller but was functional Still a good size for central London , Breakfast was cooked to order and it was all you can eat Great selection to choose from Very handy location for tube and rail services 
283760,Megaro Hotel, It was hot in the room and we were unable to open the window to have some fresh air in Being able to open a window to air the room would be great , Clean spacious room and very clean bathroom very good Location of this hotel is perfect the Kings Cross St Pancras train and underground is just 1 minute walk away so very convenient 
283761,Megaro Hotel, The bar tender in the cocktail bar was rude when we came in from a night at the theatre He decided to close the bar early after a quite night hotel staff said the bar is open till 2am He decided to stop serving at 12 30 I did manage to get a drink though he just didn t make us feel particularly welcome , Spacious room lovely view of st pancreas station clean and tidy great coffee and lovely staff 
283762,Megaro Hotel, Some street noise from surrounding neighbourhood , Location cleanliness comfort of apartment for a family with two teenagers not huge but this is London little extras left in kitchen milk tea coffee sugar water 
283763,Megaro Hotel, Nothing bad to say The bathroom could do with a blind to block the daylight as it comes through in the morning however this was not a big issue at all , Room was large and spacious It was very quite which we did not expect after reading reviews and due to its location Staff were extra friendly and always happy to help 
283764,Megaro Hotel, A bit pricey to me Bath window had no shutters so I had to sleep with eye mask All good for the rest, Fancy artsy really unique Looking fwd to showing it to my wife

283771,Megaro Hotel, A bit of an older interior compared to the exterior of the hotel the room had fitted carpets which were stuffy and dusty , Location is excellent and very convenient Literally in front of Kings Cross and St Pancras Which is perfect if you want to take the trains in London and surrounding area early in the morning for work purposes The staff is extremely helpful and attentive The room was spacious

283778,Megaro Hotel, Restaurant manager was rude and we had cause to complain A discount offered to guests in the restaurant wasnt honoured in addition Reception staff attempted to resolve it which was nice but this individual let down the hotel as otherwise the overall experience was excellent and this was our second visit It, Reception staff were helpful when we had an issue and also with queries etc Room was clean and comfortable Location is good too

283792,Megaro Hotel, Bath was a a little slippery without a mat, Staff were fantastic and the take away coffee cups in the minibar were a nice touch that all hotels should make a standard 
283793,Megaro Hotel, Floor was tiled at the entrance and was a little bit slippery due to the bad weather but the signs were adequate and staff were mopping and cleaning to reduce mud leaves My only minor quibble really Couldnt work the heating in the room but that was more user error than a fault of the hotel , Fantastic location room surpassed expectations SKY TV sofa and coffee table fully stocked mini bar and a coffee machine Beds were lovely and comfortable extra pillows and fluffy large towels on a heated towel rack Front desk staff were welcoming and helpful Was perfect for our over night stay So easy to get to and from our different activities in London

283800,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Hotel has a design touch for being one that so close to train station Great location for Kings Cross and St Pancras train stations and right next to underground The restaurant is offering excellent food from breakfast to diner and with very warm ambiance and good service 
283801,Megaro Hotel, Nothing only weird thing was watercress on porridge for breakfast , We asked for a nice quiet room and we got one We were only stopping in London because we were travelling on to Switzerland but the position opposite St Pancras was brilliant Staff were very friendly and helpful Room was large and comfortable and was a standard room

283804,Megaro Hotel, The room wasn t cleaned properly when I arrived There was a used cotton bud on the bathroom floor in plain sight which housekeeping staff should not have missed Yuck I asked the front desk to get it removed the next day and it was gone when I came back that evening , Very close to Kings Cross underground Modern vibe and comfortable bed and pillows Huge bathroom
283805,Megaro Hotel, Nothing at all, Stayed in the Apartments which had Comfortable Beds all modern facilities everything that you would need tea coffee and water and milk in the fridge little touches that made this home from home Oh and the Shower was amazing 
283806,Megaro Hotel, Hot water was very tricky to get in the tap when needed most Had to wait and waste a lot of water even to get Luke warm water A loop line is the answer , Outstanding support and smiling attitude of front desk staff super 
283807,Megaro Hotel, I was upgraded to a room on the top 6th floor of the hotel just before they told me that the lift was out of action This was manipulative it should have been the first thing they told me It is an expensive hotel for what you get breakfast is not included and the restaurant is also expensive really 20 quid for a posh burger , A nice boutique hotel very close to Kings Cross Modern comfortable and friendly 
283808,Megaro Hotel, The apartment is very fashionable but the toilet large square shaped and bowl shaped sink could be changed to something more practical , We stayed in the apartments They were ideal for someone with a young family The location is ideal as they are right next to the tube with lots of amenities around the area 
283809,Megaro Hotel, On check in I was not told or shown where anything was such as the bar restaurant etc My room was quiet dark with the window overlooking offices So I had to draw the blinds while getting dressed which made the room feel even darker The carpet was very stained and there were no slippers available so I had to put socks on while in the room The rooms felt needed a bit of love refurbishment The bathroom has a lot of wood paneling and it had rotted a bit in certain areas Felt dated They don t give enough toiletries for two people That felt a bit stingy, The location was excellent right by kings cross station Staff were friendly Bed was comfortable
283810,Megaro Hotel, It took hours to heat up the room on max temperature settings , comfortable bed spacious bedroom with a fridge very nice showers very nice and helpful staff

283813,Megaro Hotel, I didn t sleep very well as the room was on the side street and there was a lot of traffic noise I knew this would be the case purely of where the Hotel is located but it was still an issue , Location was perfect as wanted to be close to St Pancras for journey home in the morning
283814,Megaro Hotel, Nothing All good, Fantastic location with easy access to tube and central London Staff were lovely and the place is clean and modern The restaurant downstairs is great too 
283815,Megaro Hotel, The windows were terrible Letting every noise in from outside drunks and idiots from nearby pub kept us up till morning this was not main building but further down the street which housed the flats, Spacious and luxurious Very clean and friendly staff
283816,Megaro Hotel, Some noisy drunks outside were a bit offensive , The mini flats were excellent We booked 4 for a family wedding and we were thrilled I booked a room at the Renaissance Hotel and would rather have stayed the Megaro 
283817,Megaro Hotel, Wifi had a slight problem during my first visit Worked perfectly on the second visit , Location is great Staff is professional and welcoming Free upgrade on our second visit 
283818,Megaro Hotel, No doors to separate living room and bedroom from bathroom Awkward when 22yr old daughter was sleeping on sofa in living room Also apartment was one block from main hotel, Spacious modern apartment
283819,Megaro Hotel, Due to heavy traffic in front of the building a bit noisy definetly needed ear plugs for sleeping, Nice modern and comfortable rooms with very friendly staff right in front of Kings Cross station
283820,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, I love staying at this hotel and have stayed there before It is across the street from St Pancras train station which makes it perfect for rail travel My room was spacious clean and comfortable and the rate reasonable The staff were pleasant and very helpful There is an excellent bistro on the ground floor This is the only hotel where I will stay when visiting London 
283821,Megaro Hotel, The extra single bed in the apartment was shocking and was not suitable for an adult The sofa bed and the other bed were very comfortable , Very nice hotel and location for Eurostar to Paris was great Very nice helpful staff 
283822,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, The Megaro Hotel is absolutely gorgeous super clean and adorable The staff is really nice and the Karpo Restaurant where we had our breakfasts la carte every week are sooo delicious 
283823,Megaro Hotel, TV not working properly complete lack of TV for one night Option to move rooms offered but a spare apartment was only available for one night so would have needed to move twice Service from SKY has been poor on previous stays so maybe the hotel could re think SKY as a provider , The staff could not have been more helpful and professional especially with the annoying persistent TV problem 
283824,Megaro Hotel, On my first night there was a mosquito that bit me twice I asked the staff to help me I don t know if they did but I wasn t bit again The shower controls are a bit confusing Took me a while to figure out that turning the knob changed modes from shower to tub to jet streams , I loved the bathroom it was spacious with beautiful wood accents I was suffering from dizziness and soaking in the bath was perfect for relaxation It was an oasis from a stressful journey I also loved that it had A C 
283825,Megaro Hotel, Leaving and flying back to Sydney , Clean tidy great WiFi helpful friendly staff Very large bedroom and large bathroom Have not tried the retaurant attached to the hotel Menu does not interest us This is a very nice hotel with access to Eurostar and underground just a 2 minutes walk Would stay again and would always recommend this hotel Not cheap but very good 
283826,Megaro Hotel, Lighting was poor none above desk for reading Shower unnecessarily complicated and messy glass shield far too short , Staff extremely friendly and helpful We liked having free unlimited still sparkling water and milk Wi fi very strong and reliable 
283827,Megaro Hotel, When we got home we were billed twice on our credit card for one of our rooms had 3 altogether Contacted both the Megaro and our bank and it eventually got sorted through our bank But a word of explanation or apology from the hotel management would have been appreciated , Location opposite St Pancras Station underground and buses Friendly helpful staff and very clean comfortable and large rooms Also a bit querky and different 
283828,Megaro Hotel, Big family room for 4 at less than 200 a night Reception staff lovely Breakfast at 12 a head order as much as you want is great value in London Also has a great basement bar with art deco film theme with vintage cinema seating , Perfect location if you want to get off train and immediately drop your bags Equally good for leaving them for the next day Bit noisy at night but air conditioned rooms so just keep window shut 
283829,Megaro Hotel, The apartments are great for larger groups however would be way more user friendly if more privacy in bathroom area glass door on shower and toilet area with open wash basin outside of both Had an issue with A C in unit not working on a very hot night facilities night guest manager came to look but nothing he could do said to open windows already done even though night time on busy street and easily accessible Had another issue with bed discovered next morning and when mentioned to front desk on check out In addition to very hot room no offer to try to make it right ,No Positive
283830,Megaro Hotel, The separation from the hotel is not ideal particularly in terms of access to hotel facilities restaurants and bars and room service , Great location and facilities the apartments have everything you need for a short or long stay You do feel like you re living in a Georgian London Square 
283831,Megaro Hotel, Dirty carpet in room Stains on sofa in room Hot water not working at bathroom sink and could not be fixed Also appeared not reported internally for repair before next guest check in Was evident when I raised this at check out TV sky card not functioning so watching tv not possible, Location perfect for accessing Kings Cross and St Pancras
283832,Megaro Hotel, Funny smell in the bathroom smelt like Spain with the drains thankfully it cleared was going to say something but didn t have to, Bed very comfy spacious room great staff
283833,Megaro Hotel, You need a ladder to climb into the bath A bit pricey for what s on offer , Great location Room decor was basic but clean and comfortable Staff were lovely welcoming and very helpful 
283834,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location as I had to catch an early train from St Pancras Hotel staff was very friendly and polite I was surprised by the size of my room it was very spacious and nicely decorated bed was very comfy as well 
283835,Megaro Hotel, I drew the short stick and had to sleep on the pull out couch , Nice modern hotel directly across from Kings Cross St Pancras A perfect choice for our night before taking an early Eurostar train to Paris 
283836,Megaro Hotel, It was all lovely Just a door on the bathroom might be a good idea , We stayed in one of the apartments which is not part of the hotel It is just round the corner but we hadn t realised It is still in a good location and here weren t any problems Also the door to the bathroom toilet is frosted so could lead to awkward encounters if coming in from the bedroom 
283837,Megaro Hotel, The one and only thing that immediately comes to mind is the bathroom tub shower situation The tub was big but I need a shower I don t like to sit kneel and use the handheld Just doesn t work for me I was surprised to see it in such a modern excellent hotel I have encountered these before in Europe but usually in smaller or more traditional hotels The hotel is located just inside the London Congestion Zone We drove from Chipping Campden to London The Enterprise car hire drop off is at St Pancras so it was convenient But we were not allowed to idle at the side of A501 to drop off my family and bags which would have allowed an easy turn onto Pancras Rd for car return so I had to turn onto Belgrove St to drop them and turn around which resulted in a Congestion Zone charge for the mere minutes I dipped into the Zone Not really the Hotel s fault but still a caution , Megaro Hotel is well located directly across the street from St Pancras and King s Cross stations The property has the hotel proper and a really nice apartment building around the block on the corner of St Chad and Argyle Square We decided to come to London a day early and Megaro Hotel s excellent customer focused staff helped us find an adequate room as our initially booked Family Room wasn t available that night They put us up in the One Bedroom Apartment basement level in the separate building which was FABULOUS Seriously I d live there Full kitchen with spacious living room that had a pullout double and the excellent capable staff brought a rollaway single in for my son The bedroom is large with a very comfortable queen bed Two TVs in the apartment air conditioning Wi Fi router in each apartment The bathroom was modern and huge The only drawback was that it was a tub with a hand held shower head you couldn t stand and shower The location doesn t have a lot of sights or places to go but the Kings Cross St Pancras tube station has 6 tube lines stopping there you re stops from ANYWHERE in greater London And there s a great Pizza Union a 2 3 minute walk from the apartment which has freshly made brick oven pizza for takeaway We liked the One Bedroom so much that the staff managed to get us to be able to stay there in the same room for essentially the same price for the duration of our stay As we were taking the Eurostar at a very early time upon our departure from London you couldn t pick a better spot There s not much that I can say bad about this place and so much to say good Great facilities location staff 
283838,Megaro Hotel, Generally a bit overpriced in my opinion Some of the customer facing staff receptionists waiters not up to speed with difficulties in English Could be the reason why we didn t have our minibar re filled for two consecutive days needed to ask burned bulb to be changed etc bits , Great location although not downtown strictly speaking However the immediate proximity of King s Cross St Pancras station gives easy rail access to the main London airports and most of the tube lines Classy tidy and well maintained 
283839,Megaro Hotel, The rates are a little steep , The room was really clean and of quite good size by London standard The hotel is very close to train station and a lot of restaurants 
283840,Megaro Hotel, Issue with payment when leaving which really could have been avoided and was a staff error, Upgraded to a fantastic room which was fabulous Really great customer service Food is delicious and reasonably priced Free wifi is fast and reliable Location is brilliant right at the door of kings cross 
283841,Megaro Hotel, I didn t care for the layout of the bathroom with the open entrance to the bedroom It is awkward for privacy for a family of four , The bed was very comfortable The apartment was well laid out and well equipped The location was very convenient though a bit hard to spot at first 
283842,Megaro Hotel, Only thing we didn t like was the noise It was a Saturday night and the staff upon check out told us they could of supplied earplugs , Nice and close to St Pancras Station for eary morning Eurostar
283843,Megaro Hotel, If I had to find something negative to say it would be the coffee machine which we found difficult to operate despite the instructions and when we finally did manage to get it working the coffee was only luke warm We resorted to instant coffee in the end , We booked an apartment to stay in over our wedding week end It was a home away from home with everything you may possibly need at hand We were greeted with a bottle of champagne to congratulate us which was the icing on the cake The staff were so friendly and helpful nothing was a problem I would definitely recommend this hotel apartment 
283844,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Staff were especially helpful and pleasant Location near St Pancras Kings Cross stations was ideal for us having arrived on Eurostar from Paris and departing a couple of days later for Edinburgh by train 
283845,Megaro Hotel, We were told we had access to our own garden and there was no access so very disappointed could of stayed somewhere with a balcony instead , The appartment was quite stylish
283846,Megaro Hotel, Soundproofing should be improved Traffic from street kept me awake I was in a room facing the stations Also bath tub shower needs handles and some kind of matting so that one feels safer getting in and out I m pretty agile but had trouble and felt it would be dangerous and possibly lead to lawsuits , Loved the friendly helpful staff Location was great for me near train stations British Museum Leicester Square Easy for bus travel to Natuonal Theatre Globe Theatre Spacious room 
283847,Megaro Hotel, As a wheelchair user unfortunately the facilities I require where not in the same room If I could blend two of the rooms one with the suitable bed and one with the suitable bathroom it would be perfect At the moment is there is not one room which fully suits my needs However the staff do their best to accommodate, Staff where incredibly helpful and friendly Rooms where a very good size very clean and extremely comfortable The location is perfect for the train station and many bus services Fantastic breakfast array of cocktails and bar with a great atmosphere 
283848,Megaro Hotel, Getting up early to catch the Eurostar so missed the breakfast , A1 climate control Great tea coffee facilities funky bath room Very comfortable bed with white linen 
283849,Megaro Hotel, The room on my first stay was great and was value for money even though there is no breakfast included and was quite expensive The room I had on this stay was not of the same standard but cost more and still didn t include breakfast , Had stayed a few days earlier en route to Europe via Eurostar so was very convenient as is just across the road from St Pancras 
283850,Megaro Hotel, Very limited menu at Karpo restaurant Front reception area very dark , Our room was spacious bed extremely comfortable air conditioning wonderful bathroom very clean and spacious also Proximity to St Pancras was an absolute bonus 
283851,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Loved the color and design of the place had a very friendly vibe especially with the professional and welcoming front counter staff 24 7 The location can t be better right across the street from St Pancras and Kings Cross Still very quiet no street noise 
283852,Megaro Hotel, The area outside the hotel is very dirty with rubbish and general grime It is very conveniently located near the station but be prepared for the unsavoury things that accompany this location Can t fault the hotel though , Lovely contemporary rooms with modern facilities Staff go the extra mile to be helpful Would definitely stay here again 
283853,Megaro Hotel, There was no kitchen scissors and the square shaped toilet seat terribly uncomfortable , The staff went the extra mile for guest Very friendly and helpful Breakfast was excellent too The sofa bed was surprisingly comfortable 
283854,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Idea location for exploring London Adjacent to Kings Cross St Pancras station and within walking distance of many attractions Friendly staff and classy hotel decor 
283855,Megaro Hotel, On arriving home from our stay I noticed a decrepancy in my bank accounts They had pre authorised the first nights stay on the sunday before we had even arrived on the monday then in check in they pre authorised the further 2 nights which is fine until we came to check out and go home I paid the final balance if 563 on my card and thats the only receipt i received Arriving home i checked my bank and an extra 25 had been taken out separately without for one my consent and secondly unsure as you what or why I rang the hotel to find out why and what it was to be told they couldn t help I had to email the hotel so I emailed straight away on the saturday In the mean time I had checked my bank accounts again and I was missing 276 pound that seemed to be in limbo somewhere after calling my bank it was 2 different pre authorisations from the megaro I rang the hotel again to be told I had to email I already had done They were not helpful at all in dealing with the situation I finally got a message back to say sorry for the inconvenience and they had refunded the 25 and the pre authorisation for the 153 was voided so would return to my bank soon but due to the weekend it may take a while Nothing mentioned about the 123 as apparently there is no record of that amount apart from my final balance which is what I paid still waiting for this 6 days after my stay it will be another phone call to the hotel later to try again to solve this problem but I doubt it , The hotel was amazing we had a lovely stay We had a deluxe double room over looking the stations the room was spacious and comfortable The bathroom door was glass so if you don t know your travel companion that might be an issue but for us it just added to the style of the room Staff while we were there were helpful and always had a smile to greet you 
283856,Megaro Hotel, A little bit tired around the edges The price is a bit too high for what you get , Very convenient for Kings Cross and St Pancras stations Good size rooms and bathroom Friendly staff
283857,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Great apartment very close to the tube and mainline stations As it was round the corner from the hotel building and main road it was quiet Facilities were excellent as were the staff 
283858,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Megaro Hotel is an elegant modern hotel just across King s Cross station Our room was very large clean and confortable Staff is great Diego and Bruno at the front desk were nice and helpful I would strongly recommend this hotel
283859,Megaro Hotel, The rooms were dated This hotel needs a renovation and updated decor The bed was not particularly comfortable , I really like the staff and the location was ideal for us
283860,Megaro Hotel, I don t think there was anything I didn t like , The facilities were all good the staff friendly and the hotel was very convenient for Kings Cross and the Eurostar 
283861,Megaro Hotel, Only 1 chair , Very convenient location for getting around on public transport Good sized room with modern interior Room has coffee machine kettle and free cold water bottles in the fridge 
283862,Megaro Hotel, The hairdryer being in the bedroom and the glass bathroom door which is not very cool especially when with a friend, Its location cannot be beaten Kings Cross is a great hub and very safe The deluxe room was just like the photos on booking com and the view of St Pancras right in front of us was amazing I ve already started to plan my next trip to London which includes Hotel Megaro 
283863,Megaro Hotel, The bedroom closing systems is the noisiest I have ever come across There was an 1 inch open gap under the door I felt I was sleeping in the doorway Could not get any decent sleep due to frequent door banging,No Positive
283864,Megaro Hotel, We weren t made aware early on that the apartment we reserved for our kids was in a totally separate building Although it proved safe and comfortable we still would have preferred to all be in one hotel building for ease of communication and coordination , The staff were indeed very friendly and made our stay even more homey The hotel restaurant Karpo also had excellent service and great food 
283865,Megaro Hotel, See thru toilet door, Location was fabulous could spread out and being appartments could eat in at breakfast etc Staff were very friendly and appartment was in a quiet location 
283866,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Staff exceptionally friendly and helpful Room was excellent and spotless Hotel located facing Kings Cross and St Pancras train stations easy access to west end Restaurant was great for food and breakfast Celebrated our wedding anniversary and staff placed a bottle of Prosecco in our room for us wonderful touch Would highly recommend and will return here one day

283868,Megaro Hotel, II, We enjoyed our stay at the Megaro before after our holiday the staff were all helpful and friendly and the breakfast was good It is our 4th visit to the hotel we will be staying again in the future 
283869,Megaro Hotel, It was a bit noisy from Euston Road but when the windows and curtains were closed at night it was OK , The location was excellent for us It is right across from St Pancras and King s Cross Station with many good pubs around it The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and were available 24 hours a day The bed and pillows were comfy The bathroom was big the towels luxurious and we loved the towel warmer We enjoyed our room facing Euston Rd One morning there was a brass band playing in front of St Pancras Station that we could enjoy from our room 
283870,Megaro Hotel, Put the coffee and tea making in a more open space not the cupboard , Quiet for London comfortable very clean and fresh Great bed and shower Friendly staff nothing too much trouble Ideal location close to Kings Cross 
283871,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, the location is excellent just opposite kings cross station I was upgraded to an apartment and it was super lush kitchen living room bedroom everything I could possibly need 
283872,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, We stayed in one of the apartments which are in a separate building around the corner from reception Apartment was very nice Staff had made it up as requested with sofabed in living area made up for two Great wi fi lots of amenities in unit Great location for our morning train from King s Cross 
283873,Megaro Hotel, None, Very nice and friendly and helpful working staff Excellent location very easy to move around London or connect for train air travel More than easy to find different food nearby the hotel Very good price for the location and the comform service they offer 
283874,Megaro Hotel, I Checked in late and upon arrival the r ception staff informed me that I Had been upgraded In an annex of the h tel similar to an appartment The aircon Was not working hence it Was really hot there Was a strong damp moisture smell coming from the bathroom which is adjacent to the room I asked to be moved back to a r gular room in the h tel and Was answered that it Was Fully booked Not sure then about the upgrade they Just Offered What Was available And it Was Poor standard to my opinion,No Positive
283875,Megaro Hotel, Breakfast wasn t great but not a real issue, Very comfortable very clean and very nice staff Grey location for getting around London with kings cross right across the road
283876,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, We had an upgrade so really not the most objective review However based on our experience I d recommend Megaro in a heartbeat Very good location Nice hotel 
283877,Megaro Hotel, Had to contact reception to get them to adjust the air conditioning but it was no problem and once we got the temperature right it was very comfortable , Staff were very pleasant and helpful It was no problem to leave our bags with them before we checked in and again after we checked out Lovely rooms with very comfortable bed and huge bathroom Tube station entry outside the front door Very nice restaurant which does a great breakfast 
283878,Megaro Hotel, Because the room was big the TV was way to far from the bed Standard double therefore no street view , Great location across the road from Kings Cross Free Wi Fi Spotlessly clean rooms and eu suite Large screen HD TV with standard SKY channels Nice big room 
283879,Megaro Hotel, A little pricy but that s London , Very best location Quiet Clean Helpful Underground entrance steps from front door Easy access to Eurostar and all airport trains Perfect
283880,Megaro Hotel, The fact that the full tariff was taken from my card before we arrived despite assurances this would not happen, The closeness to Kings Cross railway station
283881,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, I booked a room at this hotel as it was perfectly locAted to kings cross station I had an early train to Paris the following morning I arrived at about 8 30 in the evening checked in and was told I had been up graded to a suite delighted I was taken across the road to a separate building and was very happy to be shown a beautiful large lounge and kitchen area amazing modern bathroom and lovely bedroom after a quick freshen up I went back to the bar and restaurant to meet friends all staff very friendly and the whole place was very modern and trendy great start to a fantastic weekend break 
283882,Megaro Hotel, I know it s London but I still wish it cost less , Location across the street from Kings Cross St Pancras is ideal for ease of getting luggage to train Rooms are a bit more spacious than I have come to expect in London and a proper WC was unusually easy to move around inside 
283883,Megaro Hotel, Nothing , The very personal welcome letter left especially for us with a delicious and quite large chocolate cake the very helpful and friendly staff and the location is perfect directly opposite St Pancras station Definitely would stay again 
283884,Megaro Hotel, Step between the kitchen and living main room is very dangerous and blend with the color of the floor there is no yellow marking or lighting or marking to indicate there is a step once you go from the kitchen to the main room once you enter and I almost failed one time because I failed to notice the step this might be a recipe for an injury from a guest It would be nice to have a thick solid drape or sliding door between the living room where the sofa bed is and where the main bedroom is for privacy sleeping or watching TV when one side want to do something else than the other side It would be nice to have a polished window for the toilet corner it is embarrassing at time to use the bathroom while people see you through the transparent glass door, Very happy with the apartment roomy luxury my family loved the shower clean quiet safe and modern with all comfort and a well equipped kitchen Love the expresso machine provided Very friendly and attentive staff ready to help anytime Great location Quiet and safe although located outside the hotel
283885,Megaro Hotel, We did not like that the Megaro was overbooked and that we were asked to go to the California to stay one night In hindsight we should have turned them down as the California does not measure up to the Megaro It was small stuffy and hot with no AC and other patrons and the neighbourhood were noisy We wanted to shake off the jet lag but didn t do it here It was ok but the Megaro was so much better , The room itself is large and well appointed Comfortable bed Huge bathroom I wish I had the time to take a hot bath Fab views of the St Pancras Hotel 
283886,Megaro Hotel, Only problem was that there was a projection at the end of the bed which my husband tripped over A bit of a hazard at night , Excellent large room with all facilities One of the best rooms we have stayed at in London Also very close to St Pancras for the Eurostar
283887,Megaro Hotel, From the outside it looks a bit rundown but inside is great The overhead shower defeated me so I flooded the bathroom with the smaller one Put up a notice how to change them over please Also somewhere to put stuff in the shower , The staff were very welcoming and the room was large modern clean and comfortable A very good size for central London There are a few high tech bits a coffee machine once I found it and sorted out how to put water in Lots of lights although brighter lighting in the bathroom would help with the makeup and air con which I struggled to find out how to turn off The answer is ask the staff who were enthusiastic and helpful throughout It is very convenient for St Pancras and Kings Cross stations as it s just across the road Buses and tubes are close by as are a selection of restaurants I hope to stay there again 
283888,Megaro Hotel, Price a bit more expensive than I would have liked to pay However this was soon forgotten when greeted by very friendly staff at reception on arrival , Very large room for London and location Opposite King s cross and St Pancras station perfect for catching Eurostar or northern trains I was travelling to York and did not want to get up super earlier to catch the train to staying at the Megaro was ideal and I would definitely stay again 
283889,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, The front desk staff were extremely helpful I arrived at 8 am after an all night flight and they allowed me to have a room early so I could sleep This was important for the rest of my visit 
283890,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable the view magnificent the receptionists better than excellent The room had everything needed for good rest The location of the hotel is superb We ll definitely return 
283891,Megaro Hotel, The AC Heat controls in the room didn t work The room was too cold , Clean and well designed rooms Wonderful restaurant with excellent breakfast Friendly and engaging staff who treated me more like family than a guest Great location across from King s Cross station Good value for the money 
283892,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Comfortable bed and good sized room we were upgraded Good sound proofing against traffic noise Full breakfast good value but also liked being able to pay for what we wanted rather than having to pay for full breakfast 
283893,Megaro Hotel, Nothing it is fabulous , You really cannot praise the staff at Megaro enough they are simply outstanding We have stayed twice had different staff and they are consistently fantastic They really go the extra mile 
283894,Megaro Hotel, The apartment we were staying in was about a 3 4 min walk from the main hotel which wasn t clear when we booked That having been said the apartment itself was nice but did have an odd quirk that you couldn t hide the loo from the bedroom The apartment would have benefitted from a dishwasher , The location is great just across from St Pancras Reception staff were really helpful and friendly The restaurant staff didn t sometimes seem that engaged We stayed in an apartment rather than the main hotel Having a separate lounge and a kitchen was great and it was well enough equipped to prepare simple meals I think if you stayed in the main hotel the experience would be different 
283895,Megaro Hotel, The air conditioning is controlled downstairs and the room was sweltering we managed to open the windows by unhooking the security catch but it was so noisy at night as Kings Cross doesn t appear to sleep , Its all about the location
283896,Megaro Hotel, 1 It would be much better if you could bath shower without worrying that the floor will get wet 2 More shelves to place necessary things in the bathroom, Very convenient to travel around Very nice helpful staff Good breakfast Cleanliness
283897,Megaro Hotel, Stairs up to the top floor , Our apartment is 2 mins walk away the hotel on the top floor of Victorian houses Good location just opposite Kings Cross station Friendly and helpful staff Good view from the room Fully equipped kitchen with salt and pepper and complimentary tea coffee Comfortable bed Good rain shower with sufficient pressure

283899,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Second time we have stayed there this year Location right opposite Kings Cross tube station is perfect for getting in and out of West End which is also walkable Friendliest and most helpful staff we have ever encountered anywhere in a city hotel Spotlessly clean Room really well equipped We stayed in room 304 which was a standard double but it was huge compared to equivalent standard rooms at other hotels The room looked out at St Pancras station The windows are double glazed so there is no traffic noise whatsoever 
283900,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, This was separate from the main hotel staying in an apartment just round the corner Loved every bit of it loads of room great kitchen facilities 2 big TVs beautiful shower great place just across the road from kings cross station excellent location Defiantly be staying there again soon 
283901,Megaro Hotel, Smell of sewage in bathroom Not particularly clean windows and shiny surfaces were dirty Expensive considering my points above See through doors in bathroom one to bear in mind if sharing,No Positive
283902,Megaro Hotel, Only that we were on a high floor in the apartment block and had to carry all our luggage up several flights of stairs as there was no lift We were off on holiday the next day so had large suitcases etc , Bed very comfy Heated bathroom floor lovely Kitchen great Very modern and clean Excellent location for Eurostar
283903,Megaro Hotel, Nothing, Location Great for Kings Cross Euston St Pancras We use this hotel when traveling by train so we can drop our bags as soon as we arrive then head into town Come back to sleep then easy to pick up the bags again just before we head off home Also nice clean and comfortable with great staff
283904,Megaro Hotel, Nothing , Warm and friendly greeting from the staff at reception Excellent room and facilities and a great location Very impressed and will be staying again Highly recommended 
283905,Megaro Hotel, No shower cap to keep my hair dry in the beautiful rain shower So not much to moan about really , Stylish design The most comfy beds and quality linen Excellent value for money Good quality bathroom products Room was spacious and exactly like the picture on the website Rain shower Boutique bathroom

283913,Megaro Hotel, Whenever I arrive at the Megaro it is early to mid morning after a slog of an all night flight from SE Asia Every time they say check in time is 2pm Every time I say I really can t walk around London for 5 hours till 2pm and can they please find a room for early check in Every time they manage to but it is something they should do automatically Even with full occupancy the night before people will check out at different times and rooms will become available at different times some quite early They will not all become available at the same time at 2pm The check in staff need to understand this when a guest arrives early Instead of trotting out the 2pm check in thing they should understand the guest s needs and set about finding an early check in opportunity Every time I push the issue they manage to find one I don t have to push hard but I should not have to push at all if they used their initiative and appreciation of the situation If this happens again it will be the last time I stay there , Location view across the King s Cross forecourt 
283914,Megaro Hotel, The noise from the apartment upstairs was a downside I just missed out on the top floor apartment which I will request next time The lights hanging from the ceiling made a chinging type noise from the vibration above when people were walking around This did affect my nights sleep but not enough to put me off staying again on top floor as I am a very light sleeper It may not affect people who are heavier sleepers , The staff here are amazing They cannot do enough for you I stayed in an apartment which was very spacious and had everything you could possibly need No need to take my own toiletries next time just my toothbrush as it s all provided and is lovely Orla Kiely products The location is brilliant so I will definitely stay again Well done Hotel Megaro

283918,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, A lovely hotel with rooms that are reasonably large for a central London hotel The room was clean and had a bath and coffee machine The breakfast was cooked to order and was delicious 
283919,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, location is very convenient especially for eurostar travelers also access to the underground and to buses makes it easy to get around standard room is a bit small but is well equipped with television coffee maker iron ironing board hairdryer and safe bedding is clean and comfortable staff is extremely professional and helpful
283920,Megaro Hotel, If you are a light sleeper stay away from rooms overlooking Euston Road it never sleeps , Very comfy beds a decent coffee maker and still water provided lovely Orla Kierly toiletries a wonderfully comfortable and reasonably priced if dark bar
283921,Megaro Hotel, The room was looking tired curtain hanging off the rail table tops worn carpet worn I paid a promotional rate the normal rates would make this property seem very expensive and not good value for money , Location and cleanliness were top notch
283922,Megaro Hotel, I wasn t sure whether breakfast was included in my deal it wasn t which is fine but that could be made a bit clearer when booking That s my only constructive feedback , The staff were absolutely lovely very welcoming and warm The room was very clean comfortable and spacious and kept at a nice temperature The hotel is in an excellent location 
283923,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, The facilities in the rooms excellent shower bottled water range of tea and actual coffee Comfy bed and although a smallish room it was adequate for 1 Welcoming reception and courteous staff 
283924,Megaro Hotel, Two days after checking out I still have 230 pounds blocked on my credit cards 130 on the one I booked with and 100 on the one I paid with I assume this will be rectified soon The room overlooked Euston Rd and there was a little noise from the street not enough to bother me or my wife who is a light sleeper , The room was spacious which is unusual in London the bed was comfortable the bathroom was modern and there was a capsule coffee maker in the room There are stairs to access Kings Cross St Pancras stations right outside the hotel Staff were friendly 
283925,Megaro Hotel, The wardrobe doors were heavy glass making opening very difficult as we are Senior Citizens No biscuits with tea coffee facilities , Modern hotel friendly staff 
283926,Megaro Hotel, In apartment 6 there is a very trendy and smart aquare w c which is not very comfortable Slow breakfast service second morning , Location comfort friendly staff
283927,Megaro Hotel, nothing everything perfect, The receptionist was probably one of the friendliest politest most helpful i have ever come across very welcoming and first class customer service
283928,Megaro Hotel, The green emergency exit light above the bedroom door kept me awake, Excellent location for the Eurostar in the morning Scrupulously clean and good sized room
283929,Megaro Hotel, Rooms can be more quieter , Great location opposite Kings Cross yet quiet Good staff Fantastic restaurant will great ala carte breakfast till very late 
283930,Megaro Hotel, Limited choice for breakfast , Our room was amazing great view over the station and perfect location for underground Staff were very friendly and helpful 
283931,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, No complaints with this place I travel all over the world and this hotel is a little gem Staff was amazing very kind and accommodating Restaurant was also very good Rooms were big and the bathrooms are a nice size Good bang for the buck and a very convenient location The Kings Cross and St Pancras stations are right across the street along with the Eurostar train Taxi s are everywhere so it s easy to move around from there Don t think any of the guests were disappointed 
283932,Megaro Hotel, Nothing to not like , Excellent customer service Spacious well equipped rooms Very quiet Very convenient for traveling if arriving via Kings Cross or St Pancras
283933,Megaro Hotel, Breakfast could have been slightly earlier on the Saturday , Great location for central London We had had a deluxe room and it was a very spacious room 
283934,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, We stayed in a triple room and found it spacious and comfortable It was conveniently located near King s Cross The staff were polite and friendly 
283935,Megaro Hotel, There is a mouldy smell in the apt drainage from the shower stall is weak so water flood out and over floor back into the wood so it could or already have damaged the wood and caused mould to grow Did not know Apt 1 is in the basement Didn t get any view a pity but with noise when people walking outside the street , The size and the location the kitchenette
283936,Megaro Hotel, Couldn t turn air con below 17 would have liked some more tea sachets though i know they would be available at reception No real gripe with anything, staff were very friendly and helpful Great location for what we were in london for with regards to tube lines Rooms were very modern comfortable and although we were on a busy road soundproofing was very good to room 
283937,Megaro Hotel, After checkout I discovered the hotel had taken 365 extra out of my account which has only been returned 8 days later After contacting the hotel for support I received extremely poor service After waiting 2 days to be contacted a member of staff shouted at me interrupting me and all around providing the worst customer service I ve ever received Despite attempts to make contact after this I was completely ignored and still feel it was unresolved and as a result I had to go to my bank who sorted it for me I would only advise staying here if you can afford to pay double what is originally advertised as I ended up with 615 in total out of my account rather than the 250 I expected to pay The staff were awful in dealing with this matter and completely uninterested in anything I had to say despite having evidence from my bank that multiple transactions came out of my account I really cannot mention enough the terrible customer service absolutely disgusted , The hotel was in an excellent location very well designed with beautiful rooms 
283938,Megaro Hotel, There seemed to be a hot water issue Some hot showers but more barely warm showers , Excellent Location Near central train station and restaurants Our room was large It had a huge bathroom and great view Hotel is attached to a great little restaurant that serves breakfast lunch and dinner Very convenient 
283939,Megaro Hotel, There is no lifts in the apartment house That means if you book an apartment you will have to lift your luggages upstair by yourself , The location is perfect This hotel is near King Cross St Pancras Station where you can take several lines which cover the major sightseeings in London There is 5 minute walking distance from the hotel to the station Furthermore a Tesco Metro is close to the hotel 
283940,Megaro Hotel, Room overlooked Euston road noise levels generally okay but stayed there for 6 nights and occasionally woken by police ambulance sirens , Nice big room Comfy bed Free newspapers and good wifi Very nice staff 
283941,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic staff we were travelling for my daughters 14th birthday The staff made the room look lovely with banners and balloons They were very attentive And couldn t do enough for you 
283942,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, incredibly welcoming staff offered to change heating for me remotely avoiding the usual hotel room heating system troubles room clear airy light FRESH milk in the fridge and a proper coffee machine boutique hotel without the London boutique hotel price And fantastic views of grade 1 listed building
283943,Megaro Hotel, Restaurant attached to the hotel was average no selection of fresh fruit for breakfast and the dinner I had was average but there are plenty of alternative places nearby , The large and well appointed apartment room I stayed in was in a very quiet location in a back street well away from the noise of Euston Road not far from Megaro hotel Very friendly and helpful reception staff 
283944,Megaro Hotel, There was plenty of room for a larger bed which would have been more comfortable The shower screen was inadequate and the floor became very wet and slippery Wardrobe doors were very heavy glass and hard to slide Electric sockets not conveniently placed for kettle A shame that such a large space not better designed , Large room Large bath towels Friendly welcoming staff Proximity to Kings Cross station Breakfast available in adjoining bistro Coffee machine in room though not used 
283945,Megaro Hotel, They didn t inform us that it would be separate appartment in different building on basement floor almost without windows though we planned to have 2 separate rooms And the breakfast was in another building And the waiter in restaurant forgot about the order and disapeared and we were late to the airport as we were waiting for breakfast Will not recommend it though the location is good ,No Positive
283946,Megaro Hotel, Sadly there was no hot water in our room due to a boiler breakdown Although this was unavoidable it was not repaired until the following morning when we were departing early As there is under floor heating and it was chilly out our room was cold throughout our stay , Great Location for St Pancras Kings Cross but expected better for the cost of the room hotels in this price range need to have better facilities bars and restaurants The heritage St Pancras across the road was only fractionally more expensive on the night we stayed and there represented better value 
283947,Megaro Hotel, When I arrived at the time indicated in my booking 11 p m the hotel told me that they have given my room away to other clients After a long trip I was really disappointed about those news What is more selling my room to another customer without even contacting me by phone or at the very least dropping me a message by e mail seemed really unprofessional to me To be fair they offered me a room in a different hotel 10 minutes away by taxi but as I had a very tight meeting schedule and this was in the wrong part of town I respectfully declined Will certainly not return to this hotel after this experience despite the good location ,No Positive
283948,Megaro Hotel, Bad system of breakfest due to not possible to select different food free menu Too high price for breakfest quality of breakfest do not corespondent with high price, Good room confortable bed
283949,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Quite literally the best hotel we ve stayed in Amazing view over kings cross st Pancras Room amazing and the brasserie for breakfast and dinner was exceptional food a real treat Proper coffee espresso machine a nice touch comfortable bed great bathroom and decor very bang on trend The staff both at the hotel and in the adjoining brasserie were all very accommodating professional
283950,Megaro Hotel, Nothing we re looking forward to staying again soon , Espresso machine Quirky artistic style and decor Mini bar and room facilities Proximity to train stations Friendly and efficient staff
283951,Megaro Hotel, Not much comfy seating around restaurant was a little too much like a cafe rather than hotel Didnt get as far as the bar cause we went out , Room was excellent and staff to Welcomed with glass of champagne as we were celebrating a birthday lovely touch 
283952,Megaro Hotel, Filling the bath was more difficult than necessary having to actually get in the bath to start the process removing the glass panel or having something more flexible would make life easier , Excellent location right opposite King s Cross and St Pancras Comfortable bed very spacious room and great city view 
283953,Megaro Hotel, A tad noisy in the evening Next to a lot of traffic , Staff were great as always Love the location and the quality of the rooms 2nd time I ve visited this time I took a standard room ok for 1 person Get the deluxe room if you are two Definitely worth it 
283954,Megaro Hotel, I ve arranged a late check out twice now While I m a fan of the hotel I do find the late check out fee of 30 per hour a little excessive especially for repeat customers Paying 90 for 3 additional hours for room that cost 185 per night in the first place is disproportionate , this is my third stay in a row at the Megaro Friendly well run and good value for money considering the location 
283955,Megaro Hotel, I didn t like that the apartments were detached from the main hotel But nothing that can be changed , Amazing location amazing facilities and amazing staff 
283956,Megaro Hotel, No bad experience Our room temperature controller did not work but the front desk staff immediately liased with us and set it to what we wanted from their controls so we were comfortable , The staff were very friendly and efficient The hotel is visually interesting both inside and out and the bar dining area was atmospheric and well priced for great food far from the usual bland town hotels Very good position opposite the Eurostar station handy for trains tube and with a direct train like to Gatwick I would definitely stay there again 
283957,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, very helpful staff quality of room furniture bedding size of room breakfast superb unusual attention to detail from real milk in fridge specialist tea and not packet actual tea twigs designer boutique at highest end
283958,Megaro Hotel, Perhaps a little expensive but London is never cheap , Excellent situation for train travellers and for visiting British Museum Very friendly staff Interesting breakfast menu 
283959,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Great location right beside Kings Cross but unlike a lot of hotels in the area this one is really nice Best value for money I ve found in London for years 
283960,Megaro Hotel, These are not criticisms but factors you need to be aware of when you book 1 The Hotel fronts Euston Rd which is busy and noisy even on the sixth floor with the windows closed Didn t bother us but a factor to think about 2 The bathroom is large and well appointed with big semi opaque glass doors so not for those who like total privacy 3 The menu in the room implies that it is available all day but it is not At 5 30 it is highly limited and if you don t eat meat or cheese then you are left with soup and chips Good soup and chips but an odd combination Still there are plenty of places to eat in the area particularly with the stations opposite , Perfect location for travelling to Europe and north London venues like Sadler s Wells The front desk staff are delightful and efficient Our room had a great view of St Pancras and was a good size The price for London was reasonable The breakfast options are flexible and the coffee is good 
283961,Megaro Hotel, Had to wait for an hour for the the room to be ready although we were given a complimentary drink whilst waiting I was booked in under the wrong name The room was very cold even after 2 visits from the maintenance man who turned it on and off again asked for extra free standing heaters none we re produced When checking out we were asked about our stay told them of experiences guy apologised but no reduction or concession was offered and considering we paid just shy of 300 thought this wasn t very good value all in all Probably wouldn t use again , Apartment was quite nicely decorated
283962,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Loved this location and fantastic staff My luggage had been lost at Heathrow and the staff at the hotel were so helpful regarding arrival of the courier and bringing my bag to the room
283963,Megaro Hotel, As the kitchen was so nice it was ashame there was not a tea towel or oven gloves provided We wanted to make use of the kitchen so this made it harder not having them I think instructions for the oven should also be made available as we struggled to work it out , We were so impressed with our apartment Very modern and comfortable Surprised to find full sky services The bathroom was great the power of the shower was I think the best I d experienced 
283964,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Excellent hotel in an excellent location We stayed in an appartment which had a double bed a double sofa bed and a travel cot The only down side was the toilet had see through glass doors into the bedroom a little off putting 
283965,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, We stayed here twice in December before and after travelling on Eurostar Very convenient for St Pancras Lovely comfortable bed proper leaf tea and REAL milk The staff are always very helpful 
283966,Megaro Hotel, None, Massive rooms Lots of extras in the room ironing board kettle coffee machine movies on demand extra towels sheet The staff are always friendly and go above and beyond their duties 
283967,Megaro Hotel, Hard lumpy pillows Square toilet looked funky but really uncomfortable , Large comfortable apartment down the street from the main hotel so no road noise Very helpful staff Awesome shower Good Wifi
283968,Megaro Hotel, The attached restaurant opened for breakfast on Sunday at 8am we were expecting 7am , room was big it was corner one overlooking Kings Cross station and no traffic noise 
283969,Megaro Hotel, The small bed a double made for a very poor nights sleep Anyone 6 ft plus will need a room upgrade Lighting in the room could have been better , Great proximity to St Pancras Station Handy cafe and bar 
283970,Megaro Hotel, 1 When I book an apartment I check this hotel have lift However when I check in staff told me this sort of room is not in main building but it s ok for us and that building do not have lift We are lucky because our room is in ground floor our luggage are very heavy but I feel unhappy because they didn t give customer current information which about their hotel I think that is very important to all customer 2 heating system too noisy 3 because of apartment is not in main building when we call reception they took long time to our room ,No Positive
283971,Megaro Hotel, Minor point Wifi was very slow this time although it is free, Second time I have stayed here Room was slightly better than the last and even though faced out onto the main road it was quieter 
283972,Megaro Hotel, In the reception area most of the frontliner staff or front desk especially the men they re not friendly they don t greet and smile at you I came back to Megaro Hotel late night from Central London I walked past through their reception area from main entrance door and didn t say anything how rude and how dare working in that area I was overcharging and no apologies when I rung them to double check my bill it was a Spanish staff When I received my hotel bill invoice no proper breakdown and discriptiion very frustrating , Very convenient for transportation wise like to the train stations both national and international and London Underground also waliking distance to shops and restaurants The bed is very comfy and cosy Healthy breakfast so scrumptious it s a veggie choices like scrambled eggs with lentils 
283973,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic large room on top floor with gorgeous ad ons from real tea proper coffee maker rainfall shower and yummy toiletries Staff were excellent from friendly cleaners great waiters at breakfast even a happy Christmas from chef to wonderfully chirpy front of house This is a glorious boutique hotel in a prime location 
283974,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Location size of room and friendly staff We stayed in this hotel at the beginning of our holiday and also when we returned We traveled to and from Italy by train and it was opposite St Pancreas and near to Euston The restaurant attached to the hotel was very good and the staff were very helpful
283975,Megaro Hotel, The shower was only luke warm , The staff were great very helpful We were able to check in at 10am and leave our luggage Room was a good size Bed comfy lovely linen and pillows Had a great night s sleep 
283976,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Location very easy access to St Pancras and also underground so London was easy to access We had a deluxe room on second floor Which was really nice wasn t noisy and the windows all looked out over the busy streets and the stations which was actually quite nice from 2nd floor 
283977,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Location could not be better absolutely perfect for getting everywhere in central London and right beside Tube stations Modern comfortable room very friendly welcoming staff 
283978,Megaro Hotel, Some of the waiters on the restaurant weren t very nice , The staff was really helpfull and nice to us The room was really clean and comfortable The food from the restaurant is amazing 
283979,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location for travellers arriving departing from Kings Cross St Pancras as it really and truly is just across the road Unbelievably friendly staff on reception and in the restaurant Excellent size room as London hotels are usually notoriously small Masses of wardrobe and storage space Loved the Orla Kiely complementary toiletries 
283980,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Staff is extremely pleasant and helpful Room was very spacious and comfortable Breakfast was delicious and not absurdly expensive as in fashion nowadays Definitely coming back
283981,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Everything about the hotel was excellent I asked for a quiet room and got it Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and the accommodation was clean comfortable and stylish Great location directly opposite King s Cross A really good restaurant bar bistro just tops it all off I wouldn t look any further for accommodation in this general location Great value for money and the kind of service you don t often get Wonderful 
283982,Megaro Hotel, No hotel bar or lounge Restaurant separate and lot of off street trade I was unable to get booking although quick to provide room service , Big roomy bedroom Comfortable bed 
283983,Megaro Hotel, Access to Dining and drinking, The position and avaibility of transport services a really good comfortable Hotel with lovely rooms and comfortable beds
283984,Megaro Hotel, Noise was absolutely horrific Didnt get a winks sleep and made my case to staff next day but got no response Loads going on in middle of night on are floor, Location 
283985,Megaro Hotel, Room with a city view was hardly an attractive view but hadn t time to sit and look out on the roofs and back yards so it didn t matter , Quiet comfortable great value for central London more interesting than the usual box with a bed Charming staff I ve stayed in many 4 and 5 London hotels and this is better than most of them 
283986,Megaro Hotel, Loved everything about the stay at Megaro but London in general is very expensive , The surrounding area was lovely lots of options for eating and shopping Tube station practically outside the door with easy access to all parts of London so easy to get around with kids Spotless apartment modern decor friendly staff arrived early and left bags until room ready would go back 
283987,Megaro Hotel, A very pleasant experience Maybe a bit more choice in restaurant would improve the experience Not a complaint just an observation , Location friendliness of staff lovely room Nothing was too much trouble for hotel and restaurant staff 
283988,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, We were changing from the Inverness train to Heathrow next morning It couldn t be better placed for this its less than 5 mins walk from Euston And the facilities and staff were much better than we expected for the price 
283989,Megaro Hotel, Staff here are among the rudest I have encountered Check in not ready on time Be aware that one bedroom apartments being advertised are NOT ONE BEDROOM They are open plan with no screen or door , Good location near Kings Cross 
283990,Megaro Hotel, The hotel is superbly situated in front of the eurostar station but if you are looking for an ultra quiet location look elsewhere for all other travellers 100percent recommended , Excellent staff friendly and helpful A plus all the way 
283991,Megaro Hotel, Regrettably the Megaro s location means that noise from the surrounding roads is rather intrusive , Helpful and efficient staff pleasant modern rooms 
283992,Megaro Hotel, Only down side was that the milk had gone off however when we mentioned it at reception they immediately made us some tea , The room was great we had a separate seating area with a separate tv for that area and for watching in bed Huge bathroom wet room Great location for St Pancras which was literally across the road and perfect for restaurants bars close by
283993,Megaro Hotel, Breakfast is in a quasi independent caf and cannot be included in the price The price is very high compared to British prices outside London , Nice boutique hotel in the St Pancras Kings Cross area Comfortable and modern excellent Wi Fi connection Excellent public transport connections 
283994,Megaro Hotel, Hotel was very warm Staff in restaurant could have been more pleasant , Fantastic location for travelling in and out of London on the train And then for getting around London with bus and tube stops right on the door step Very clean and comfortable Breakfast in restaurant was very good great selection 
283995,Megaro Hotel, If you choose wood for the walls in the bathroom you wanna budget to replace it every other year otherwise it s gonna get black i e rotten not very hygienic never mind good looking The location basically it s the crossroads opposite St Pancras Those lucky to get the room letting onto the courtyard will find it full of pigeon exrement and dudes smoking , It was quite clean and comfortable interior wise The partner grill next door serves very good breakfast 
283996,Megaro Hotel, Cleanliness and maintenance should be improved significantly Single elevator is also frequently used by the staff Last but not least hotel is extremely overpriced , Location and deluxe room size 
283997,Megaro Hotel, My upgraded apartment was very damp basement of local recent extension a short walk away with a dehumidifier failing to address damp smell etc Hotel bar is closed in a Monday night , Good location and clean with good equipment and modern decor 
283998,Megaro Hotel, The water in the shower and over the wash basin was not very warm I could have got it fixed I suppose if I drew attention to it but just put up with it The bill was more money than I would have got from other establishments if there had been a vacancy in the area It was a bit expensive , I liked the view from my window the big T V screen the mini bar the coffee machine and kettle Also the very comfy bed and cleanliness of the room The breakfast was very good and the restaurant staff were very efficient and considerate even though they were extremely busy 
283999,Megaro Hotel, They only had two staff at the front desk during check out hours Be there early if you don t plan to stand in line The wifi was a bit choppy I was getting a stronger signal from another room s wifi but I was only able to connect to the wifi assigned to my room , Well located and not hard to find Multiple Tube lines train options bus routes available nearby The apartment we stayed at was modern well maintained clean pricey but worth it 
284000,Megaro Hotel, The smell in the apartment it was not good as well as the heating system It did not work well and was very loud It would be good to add an drawer into the flat we where missing someting to put our cloth in , The size of the apartment
284001,Megaro Hotel, No negative comments to report , The location was perfect for our early morning start on the Eurostar St Pancras and the family room was very spacious 
284002,Megaro Hotel, Noise from people walking about in above flat hard wood floors Toilet has a see through door so occupant can be seen and heard bit awkward even for closest of people , Excellent location over the road from kings cross Remarkably quiet too Apartment 3 great size beautifully furnished loved it s quirkiness Shower room door missing but this has got to be one of the best showers ever 
284003,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Clearly this hotel is trying to go the extra mile over standard hotels it s got a lot of nice design features and our family room was a good size big bathroom and nice touches e g Illy coffee machine lovely toiletries etc 
284004,Megaro Hotel, We didn t realize when you book a room and an apartment that these would be in completely separate buildings and although 5 7 minutes walk apart it meant our group wasn t together Also the one bedroom apartment we booked was for 3 of the group and 4 stayed in the hotel room The one bedroom isn t a one bedroom as there is no door on the bedroom just a large oval opening So the person using the sofa bed was practically next to the couple in the bed like a room with two queens So neither had any privacy But the worse thing was the toilet and shower doors opened straight into their so called bedroom AND the toilet door was see through glass So you could see the person on the toilet from their bed Definitely not a good arrangement for sharing and some couples on their own would also find this rather strange From the shower you either had to dry and dress standing in the wet shower or move across to the see through toilet to dress or ask the couple to leave the room so you could get changed Just really didn t work for us at all these rooms are better for someone on their own , Liked location right next to St Pancras and the underground staff friendly and helpful clean rooms
284005,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Great welcome from the reception bar and breakfast staff The design of the hotel is modern and very well thought out Lots of space in the room and great extras like Orla Kiely products in the bathroom and fresh milk in the fridge 
284006,Megaro Hotel, We stay at a studio unit with kitchen and separate toilet The deign look fashion and new but not quite functional feel like a designer with not much house work experience For example the faucet water can easily spill out of basin the shower water so powerful that almost flood out of shower room the kitchen sink button is almost flat hard to drain and collect waste properly either case create difficulty of maintenance , The location is right across the King s Cross Station and the circle line tube access M S nearby couldn t be more convenient 
284007,Megaro Hotel, We had the deluxe room which was a great size but design wise the bathroom door opened dangerously close to the bed The desk chair s legs were wobbly and the bathroom floor hadn t been cleaned properly , We arrived from Paris on the Eurostar and the hotel was well located for St Pancras but better map on the website would make finding the right exit from the station easier for someone not used to the area 
284008,Megaro Hotel, Restaurant service slow and all vegetables an extra charge on main courses However the food was of a good standard , Excellent helpful and cheerful staff Rooms spotlessly clean and with every amenity required Double glazing kept most of the noise out 
284009,Megaro Hotel, Upgraded to an apartment but they are in a house up the road Sadly breakfast was a disaster No cereals or yoghurts or fruit just orange juice or granola No toast and stewed tea in a glass Too much priority to passers by since it s a coffee shop Hilton is cheaper Cramped lobby and restaurant , It s location to Kings Cross Station and underground was perfect Reception staff were kind and the apartment was spacious 
284010,Megaro Hotel, There were some problems with the system at check in Could not get key until that evening that s ok but I was shown to my room by a young member of staff who had difficulty getting the elevator to work and then left me in the room with no electricity Need cigarette bins at the door to the hotel and the restaurant Need to make sure the complicated coffee machine has water in it Mine had none but the two free bottles of water in the mini bar came in handy as a result , Trying to be a very cool place and almost makes it Very expensive but great location Excellent wifi coffee gorgeous in the room Free water milk and coffee is great 
284011,Megaro Hotel, I requested the reception to call a Taxi but I did not get a Taxi I waited for about 20 mins and instead of getting into a taxi I boarded a car which is contracted by the hotel to provide transportation service and was charged a flat rate instead of metered charge This arrangement should be made known in advance , Location
284012,Megaro Hotel, The hotel rang me at 5 pm and said they had made a mistake and that they were cancelling my booking They sent me across town to some other hotel not of the same standard and no where near where they were the prime reason I had booked this hotel was that it was around the corner from my meetings ,No Positive
284013,Megaro Hotel, When I made the booking I asked whether my apartment is lift accessible The response from Megaro hotel is a positive YES but then I found my room is on sub floor and that I have to walk downstairs to reach my room Thanks to the reception staff a small built lady who carry my suitcase for me , Mine is a one bedroom apartment Spacious and quiet The little kitchen is a gem Basically you got everything you need for cooking except the food Illy coffee machine is wonderful 
284014,Megaro Hotel, Only suggestion I can make is nets blinds at the windows Bathroom fan ran all night but quite quiet , Great convenient location and friendly very helpful staff Room bigger than usual for Central London
284015,Megaro Hotel, The WiFi stopped working throughout the hotel the last evening night I was there The street noise all night is very loud and the hotel windows should be at least double glazed although triple glazing would be better , I liked the convenient location the friendly helpful staff and the room itself The hotel was rather expensive but so are just about all central London hotels 
284016,Megaro Hotel, Wifi a bit patchy , Great location for Eurostar journey Good sized room Breakfast was freshly cooked not a buffet and you only pay for what you want 
284017,Megaro Hotel, Trivial stuff too few electric plugs in the room and the shower glass in the Bath is too smal water every where , Location next door to Kings Cross and tube station cool atmosphere client service tech coffee machine in room
284018,Megaro Hotel,No Negative, Very helpful friendly staff room included espresso coffee m c and milk Also kettle etc Very good location for St Pancras and Kings Cross just across the road for an early start 
284019,Megaro Hotel, We were booked with other members of our family but wasn t in the hotel a few minutes walk away so didn t feel included Wouldn t have booked if we had known,No Positive
284020,Megaro Hotel, Too many homeless sleeping around the hotel area , The hotel is centrally located to all the key tourist spots either by foot or the tube The room was clean and spacious It was really nice but was a little noisy being at the front of the hotel on Euston road 
284021,Megaro Hotel, Required staff assistance to connect wifi in room , Spacious room and great location near King s Cross Station Quiet given the busy location Comfortable bed and the coffee machine was a nice addition 
284022,Megaro Hotel, Unfortunately the rooms with wheelchair accessible bathrooms didn t have beds that accommodated my needs but those without did It would be good if possible to have a mix of the two , Very accommodating with a needed change Wheelchair access generally good Funky and modern with good quality everything Lots of room space Very comfy beds Stunning room view 2 minutes walk from Kings Cross station Great breakfast Staff super friendly and down to earth 
284023,Megaro Hotel, nothing although the shower is a bit fiddly and would be better updated, size of rooms breakfast is superb and inexpensive wifi works great and is free orla kiely toiletries big bed good tv free water Just brilliant Quiet rooms at the back even though near busy road
284024,Megaro Hotel, The general d cor in the public areas Rowdy area broken bottles outside etc , Great rooms well designed and welcoming Excellent location for accessibility Different choice on the breakfast menu a welcome change from the usual Warm reception from the staff and very efficient service on the front desk 
284025,Megaro Hotel, Nothing, Gem of a find true neighbourhood hotel bistro and perfectly located for an early start at Kings Cross In the little black book of good finds
284026,Megaro Hotel, While checked out we are informed that we had breakfast but we went to York on that day didn t know what happened with restaurant acount , This is second time to stay with them Good position convenient to take train tube from King s Cross station Nice view to King s Cross St Pancras Friendly communication with reservation team free WIFI warm down duvet clean towels Iron board
