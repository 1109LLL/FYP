36127,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Everything was good , The staff were excellent Pecilla and the front desk guys were excellant giving directions recommending things to see and good eating places Breakfast was good and the young gal working there was very pleasant and made sure everything was good 
36128,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The immediate area around the hotel is third world infiltrated by many nationalities very confronting very dirty However just a couple of blocks away the streets and vendors were clean and people very pleasant , Staff were absolutely fantastic
36129,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Breakfast was limited and not Much choice Also very Small area Only tables of 2 so family s split and had to queue if All tables full, Room small but Comfy
36130,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Small room but to be expected really in a city Our first room was very noisy and the shower flooded the bathroom but we were moved with no problems after 1 night , Friendly accommodating staff Location near a metro station with plenty of nice restaurants around Convenient option of express breakfast Clean room and comfortable bed 
36131,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, the receptionist was supposed to put hold on 100E for tax charges He ended up withdrawing 200E he used the card twice though he s not supposed to Though I gave him 60 E in cash when I left hotel I still can t get the 200E he withdrew though he insisted nothing was withdrawn from my account And now it s turning into a hassle just cos a receptionist doesn t know how to use a credit card ,No Positive
36132,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, No bath but a great large wet room shower Room service was not provided by the hotel but by a contract company very very expensive to order the food they provided Little storage in the room I e no drawer units or bedside cabinets , The bed was very comfortable plenty of lighting Good mini bar 
36133,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The breakfast hasn t got a lot of variations , The hotel was very clean the staff was always very friendly and helpful They are a lot of restaurants and bars around the hotel so you don t have to go far away with the metro the metro station is just across the street so you can easily reach the touristic sights everything was just great our thanks to the staff 
36134,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The fact that they immediately block money off your account although site said no money will be taken and pay at the property Plus charging you at the hotel again and after numerous calls they are yet to release blocked funds Room was also small although I was supposedly updated , Nothing
36135,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards,No Negative, Nice hotel conveniently located close to underground station No restaurant in hotel besides breakfast but nice brasserie across the street Small rooms but very beautifully decorated and great bathroom facilities Very clean as well Recommended 
36136,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, the walk from Gard Nord to the hotel goes through the 18th Arrondissment and feels quite a rough part of town and was very intimidating to my wife as there were lots of people just standing around in the middle of the street looking at everyone, we liked the cost of the stay the location was near to the louvre and close to the river and the staff were extreamly helpful and friendly The room was small but very comfortable and there was no end of little cafe s Our favourite was a small cafe about 5 mins walk from the hotel which did a lovely Rose wine and the chipping sausage and salmon tarte was just bursting with flavour the small park you pass on the left as you walk south towards the river has a stall selling fresh mangoes bananas and other fruits Grab a Mango here for breakfast for 2 Euros they were delicious
36137,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The staff at the counter were very young and lacked knowledge on tourist attractions or even basic stuff on how to use the metro The hotel is called Marais but is not located on Le Marais which can cause confusion , The metro station was located around the corner from hotel Very convinient 
36138,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards,No Negative, Near to train station that takes you where you want to be Hotel centrally located Front desk 24h available Staff helpful friendly and professional 
36139,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The close proximity of the bar which is right next door The first night we were up because a group was outside the bar and was extremely loud Thats not the hotels fault though Luckily this was only for 1 night of our stay as we didn t hear them outside the rest of our stay , I really liked the location and the close proximity to public transportation Also lots of options close by for dining out Even a couple grocery stores too The staff spoke good English The bed was very comfy one of the most comfy beds I ve been in while traveling Europe 
36140,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Room temp wasn t regulated well Was no A C for a few hours in the afternoon which made for a very uncomfortable time Once up and running again in the evening it was fine Rooms were small but ok if you aren t spending a lot of time there Location is just outside of where you want to be in le marais , The hotel has recently been refurbished very modern and clean Bed was comfortable and block out curtains made for a very good nights sleep Staff were helpful and friendly 
36141,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, you can find the room a little bit small but not for Paris standard anyway it s nicer than Van Gogh s room D, The location right in front of the metro you can chose between 3 different lines you can be in the center with a 15 minutes walk if you want to eat in the area you can chose between a lot of brasseries but you can also find a cheaper KFC Kentucky Fried Chicken The hotel Do you need to print you boarding card just send it by e mail to the hotel and they ll print for you with no extra cost
36142,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, I can t think of anything that could have been better didn t try the breakfast , Primarily the staff were really polite friendly and helpful The room was freshly decorated to a high standard new in fact bed really comfortable and the location perfect making it easy to access the north and south of the city being only a couple of minutes from the metro 
36143,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Location wasn t as good as previous reviews suggest don t walk with bags from Gare du Nord either get a taxi or the tube Saint Denis station is conveniently right outside the property , Room was a modest size but very comfortable clean and warm In context of Paris prices this hotel represents good value for money 
36144,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, As it s in the city there was quite a lot of road noise with the windows open but to be expected , Lovely modern interior very comfortable Very clean and inviting
36145,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Extremely stingy place to stay No air conditioning as stated only switched on during the summer months despite 25 degree spring heat When the small breakfast buffet ran out it was not replaced so there was never any hot food unless you count toast or milk for cereal The rooms are advertised as soundproof but are far from it traffic sirens screaming gangs fighting doors slamming as well as noise from other rooms could be heard all night long The area is extremely intimidating and dangerous inundated with gangs drug addicts and fighting after dark and not much nicer during the day , The executive room has a hairdryer with cool setting which we ran all night to drown out the street noise and to use in place of the air conditioning that the hotel claims to have but does not permit you to use unless it s high summer The staff were friendly but few one receptionist who also acted as bartender one cook who also acted as waiter plus a cleaner who was quick and efficient but very noisy 
36146,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards,No Negative, Very modern and clean Staff were so helpful too This hotel is situated in a lovely town surrounded by beautiful shops and restaurants I also like how the hotel looked the same as online pictures 
36147,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Light sleepers might be bothered by excessive street noise outside their room But it is Paris so should be expected , The location was outstanding and was value for money spent 
36148,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The shower door doesn t have a water stopper so water got All over our room We didn t notice until it was to late But aside from that the hotel was excellenthe Just pay attention to thensure shower , Everyone was really nice 
36149,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Wifi was not always working Sometimes noice from the street, reception staff and staff breakfast very professional polite and friendly nice room with coffee maker bathroom OK
36150,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The breakfast s price was high, We really liked the modern and clean bathroom Also the bed was big and comfortable The room was completely refreshed every day Nice decoration due to the fact that it s recently renovated It s next to a central metro station It s value for money comparing with other similar hotels in the aeria
36151,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Bed could have been comfier and the charge for late checkout was extortionate which we were unhappy about No conplimentary checkout at all and cost of half a nights stay to have 2 more hours which I needed having a medical condition , Location was great and the soundproofing of the room was brill We were on the side of the building so maybe that helped but the moment you opened the French balcony doors youd have this mass of noise from the road which at night was sometimes nice for fresh air but shutting them blocked out most of the noise bar the odd horn Our room was bijoux but we didn t care at all as we didn t care about floorspace the location and quality of the room was more important Looking st the other best westerns this seems to be one of the better ones Oh and it s next to a great tube stop that goes everywhere 
36152,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards,No Negative, Very clean and modern hotel The bed and pillows are very comfortable The location is perfect the metro is just a few minutes away from hotel The Louvre and Notre Dame de Paris in a walking distance The staff was very friendly 
36153,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Central location means traffic and noises from the road are heavy even at night Also beware of city tax fee at the end of stay which is not written or contracted anywhere , Brilliant location lovely room and helpful staff for the most part Location meant it was easy to get to practically anywhere in Paris using the metro or walking 
36154,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The windows were not sound proof so was a little noisy , The location was excellent withing walking distance of the Hotel de Ville and Notre Dame Breakfast was delicious and the staff helpful 
36155,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards,No Negative, The staff were all very friendly and kindly greeted us each time we came back to the hotel Services were beyond expectations Chocolate covered strawberries were offered to us at our door not long after we came back one day Location was very convenient the catalunya metro stop is located a 3 minute walk away linking 4 different metro lines making it very easy to get around the city The Gothic Quarter and a popular shopping hub are just a walk away A Hotel that I highly recommend 
36156,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Room was not even ready when checking in it was dirty and I checkin late so no excuses The booking of the hotel is also painful and still waiting for refund of reservation , Staff on first night was great but manager at check out charged my card twice still waiting for refund very rude and completely unfriendly
36157,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Day receptionist especially chief receptionist extremely rude Complained about noise from room above and did not acknowledge my complaint at all The other day receptionist also was rude completely ignored us and was too busy sitting round the cornor drinking coffee , Good location clean and modern Night receptionists extremely helpful and friendly
36158,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The room was a bit small but however our stay was great , Very clean hotel Very friendly and helpful staff Great central location Nice and modern decoration 
36159,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The room service company was on strike so there was no food the day when i stayed plus the price on the menu was ridiculous Also the rooms are extremely small and for this price i would have expected some more comfort , The location was great and the receptionist spoke good english and was very helpful in booking taxis etc It has a 24hrs gym and is near by great shops and restaurants 
36160,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The room was smaller than expected but this is not necessarily a negative as we were only there for two nights and therefore did not need much room , Room was lovely and modern Clean and was ideal for a short stay 
36161,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The size area of the room was actually too much small My wife and myself were hardly can move in this room This was the biggest problem we faced in this hotel , The hotel staff tried to help as much as they can Especially the Receptionist Mr Denis who was very helpful and responding to our requests and needs on a timely and professional way We wish him all the best 
36162,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Toilet was placed a bit high , Room was small but clean comfy great location very close to metro and walking distance from Louvre and Le Marais 
36163,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The pictures make it look way more luxurious than it was I was nice but super small rooms and smelly carpets We got a great deal but I can imagine that you would feel robbed if you had payed full price , The staff was very friendly and we liked the location Most of the room was clean 
36164,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, very small rooms and the housekeeping staff really bad she opened my stuff and left the open door of my room very poor cleaning , Personal in reception ok 
36165,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards,No Negative, The location was excellent and the receptionists were excellent and very helpful The size of the room is little bit small I recommended this hotel for the future 
36166,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, You have to pay the breakfast And it is expensive so is better if You eat outside the location sometimes is a little dangerous, The hotel is very confortable clean Safe and beautiful the location is good Because it has underground very very near The Staff is very friendly 
36167,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Maybe 100 m from the hotel a large number of ladies of the night and their handlers Discrete so not bothersome but , Recently modernised the rooms are beautiful We took photos and will imitate the design at our home We were able to walk to Galerie Lafayette on one day and walk to Musee D Orsay on another We arrived by train and could also walk to the hotel from Gare du Nord 
36168,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The hotel billed an incorrect amount a week before arrival which as per the terms and conditions was incorrect They recognised the mistake and quickly set out to refund the amount Since we were on a month long holiday it was important for us to manage our credit card limits Thanks to the hotel staff in helping to resolve this on time Overall still happy they responded courteously and on time , The staff were excellent so hospitable and willing to help They ensured our comfort consistently I must applaud the way the rooms were cleaned everyday The hotel is very centrally located Thanks to that location we could do so much walking and sightseeing by taxi when required 
36169,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Sheet looks washed but some permanent marks dirt on it breakfast in hotel 16 p p Continental little bit expensive for that Nothing special just little packages , Location is good the room is small but they solved wisely Clean bathroom shower is nice 
36170,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, I think it was a bit over price base off of the neighborhood Also after paying 170 a night paying for a cold breakfast buffet was ridiculous Breakfast should be included , Nice staff Very clean hotel I felt safe despite being in a crappy neighborhood Lots of street walkers and hustling in the neighbor I m a city girl so I was fine I want to thank the hotel staff for excellent service and for helping celebrate my 30th bday in Paris for a week 
36171,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The attendant double charged my credit card which was frustrating and when she tried to correct it she triple charged me She then had to refund back a large amount which caused my credit card company to freeze for a fraud alert It was quite a hassle , The hotel was awesome Very nice 
36172,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The window of the shower room was not closing properly and allowed the street noise inside The phone of the bedroom did not work as well but there were many positive points to compensate , The complimentary cappuccino machine the very comfy bed the location
36173,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Bed was tiny definitely not a double Customer service was horrendous my pyjamas were taken by the maid by mistake and I never got them back The reception manager was too busy smoking to deal with it and the other staff just kept telling me it wasn t their fault so nothing to do with them , Good location beside metro and walking distance to all major attractions Basic but clean and modern 
36174,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The staff was absolutely inattentive I was there during the flood and in spite of being June it was very cold I asked why the heating was not working and they answered it had been already put only on cooling cause it was June but they will ask No one ever answered and I did freeze in my bedroom for 4 nights , The bed was okay but the room was not properly made soundproof altough directly located on traffic congested boulevard Sebastopole The room has been recently renovated but the bathroom was definetely too small and without any window 
36175,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The Blvd Sebastopol and specially the streets around the hotel were full of suspicious people just staring at walkers at all times We were walking on the Blvd on Saturday around 5 00 pm and of them insulted my wife so I told him to leave us alone the african french then reacted like crazy and wanted to attack me Fortunately there was a group of militars passing by and jumped in immediately so the guy ran away Unfortunately and as in many other areas in Paris the zone felt insecure at all times and needs more police presence , Very friendly staff Specially the portuguese lady at the front desk 
36176,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The area sounding the hotel isn t the greatest that said the hotel is located opposite a metro stop and is only a 10 12 min walk to south to the river and the Notre Dame Cathedral , Hotel was very modern and stylish We had a standard double room and it was a good size in terms of typical Parisian city centre hotels 
36177,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, On the day I checked out I asked the male staff at the front desk to help me book a taxi to the airport He said okay but I would have to pay about 35Euro I asked is it for the taxi He said yes Therefore I paid in cash I went back to my room to grab my luggage and head down after the staff called my room to inform me that the taxi had arrived He then gave me a sealed envelope containing my paid invoice Upon arriving at the airport the taxi driver asked me to pay 60 Euro for the taxi fare and I was puzzled I told him that I already paid the front desk and he said no one gave him any money I did not want to argue further so I gave him that amount I called the hotel to explained about what happened and a woman told me that the amount I have paid was actually not meant for the taxi but the outstanding balance I owed the hotel which include Breakfast on that day I checked out and a bottle of mineral water the day before I explained that I did not purchase both of them Especially because I checked out at 6am in the morning How could I have purchased breakfast The woman then asked me to write an email to them to explain my situation and they would try to refund back the amount to me I wrote and they said they would look into it 4 weeks and 4 emails later and still no response from them I am deeply disappointed at the service At least they could have replied back with some response , Good location
36178,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, They stated no smoking but room was obviously smoked in The staff was seen smoking out the window when we were walking down the street The shower pan poorly constructed Water poured into the bathroom Towels rags ripped and holes and this was the executive suite Requested quiet room and was placed on the main road, THE BED WAS COMFORTABLE THE ROOM CLEAN LOCATION GOOD BREAKFAST GOOD
36179,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Just the breakfast pricing, The staff are marvelous and helped with our bookings And although I felt the breakfast a little dear it was alway delicious and fresh Location was excellent also
36180,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, We could not use the air conditioner during the night since the fixed grills were located opposite the bed and the cold air arrived directly on our head while laying in the bed Toilet brush was broken too light weight pedal bin felt over every time at use in the bath room I found a used spoon under the table at arrival we received stained towels twice the top of the wardrobe was dusty where we wanted to put the unused pillows and blankets one day the tea mug was not cleaned on the table Once spair toilet paper roll was not placed after daily room make up There was an aireation pipe in the wall in the rooms corner which made some noise all day and night Bad sound proofing entrance doors Door closers of the rooms were adjusted incorrectly they shut the door too strongly we couldn t sleep in the mornings while other guest left or cleaning was in progress in other rooms Our door vibrated at every other rooms door closing because of the air moving Bright red standby indicator of TV was disturbing at night but the TV fixed on the wall could not be unplugged it must have been covered by black tape The receptionist could not understand our request about the iron and ironing board This turned out after waiting half on hour we had to recall and try to explain it in other language Elevator had bad vinagre smell every time , Excellent location helpful staff Black out curtains for a deep sleep in total darkness Sound proofing exterior windows Nice design in room and bath room small but well furnished and practical Good internet connection 
36181,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards,No Negative, I liked location because i needed place next to metro move fast staff was very helpful breakfast a bit poor but apple for me is enough All of the rest superb 
36182,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Room was very small but what do you expect for that price in Paris A bit of a walk into the touristy part of the city , Very friendly staff Clean and comfy room with excellent bathroom Reasonably good location with interesting locals and nightlife But it felt very safe Two minutes walk to two main metro stops 
36183,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards,No Negative, Staff needs to be a little more friendlier With the exception of our first person we spoke with they need some personal relations training Maybe it s true what they have mentioned to us that Americans aren t really excepted We noticed the personality change with the person who spoke French 
36184,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards,No Negative, Good service At the day of arrival we got a call from our hotel They had an accident so we couldn t stay there for a night But administration gave us an upgraded room at other Best Western hotel close to Opera with breakfast as a compliment The apartment was nice so we were satisfied 
36185,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Only disappointment was the fact my wife and I gotnput in a standard room when we booked an executive room but the assistant was very apologetic and we got the difference taken off our bill so it all worked out fine in the end This receptionist was exceptional in her service and mannars and could not of hoped for a better welcome to the hotel , The bed was very comfortable and he room was very clean and the facilities were all that you needed 
36186,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, We received twin rooms with just one bed Imagine how unconfortable this is when you are in a business trip with your colleagues The solution was to give us a bigger bed which we could split but the hotel did not have bed covers for more beds Temperature was in 32 farenheit 0 celsius We freezed in the room and with not enough blanket to cover us up The fire alarm was activated by someone smoking at 2 00 am Red lights and untolerable noise in the middle of the night that last for half hour Not ok At the end of our trip we were charged with leads of Euros with no reason None of us took anything from the bar Worst pricing for what we got ever Not to put a foot in this place never again , Personal in reception did as much as he could do Rooms were clean 
36187,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Towels did not change properly , Location was nice U can reach all the popular places by just 1 metro transfer Helpful staff Clean but a little small room Nice place to stay in Paris 
36188,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, our room is too small also the shower even if we have requested a bigger one on our reservation also on our arrival the request has not been satisfied I don t think so that all CLASSIC DOUBLE ROOM has that size ours for sure was the smallest breakfast small choices of food but what they serve is OK the wi fi connection during the night is too weak we had only that time to connect in the night we were always away during the day I think the telephone on our room has been set with an alarm I think for 6 am we had been waken up from that alarm everymorning , LOCATION the subway station nearby is very useful to reach all main spots Room lobby are CLEAN helpful staff specially the gentlemans but the lady on our departure date didn t help us the way we ve wanted 
36189,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Very noisy and expensive breakfast , Room on the first floor street side was extremely noisy You can hear discussions of people in the street cars passing by etc 
36190,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, We had ground floor room with no option to change faced onto street people on other side of window while we slept Bar poor breakfast expensive , Location staff cleanliness and comfort of bed
36191,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, The shower is bad designed The water go through all the bathroom and the room , Good location No perfect but good The hotel is near to metro station and 15 min walking to notradam
36192,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Breakfast room is too small and the staff overworked to the extent that an order for scrambled eggs took nearly 30 minutes to arrive The staff member was apologetic but with upwards of 30 guest for her to serve on her own she was let down by her managers , Clean and comfortable hotel convenient to metro and bus links
36193,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, We had a very unpleasant stay and we believe the experiences we had is unacceptable to everyone not only us We booked two rooms for three nights check in on 19th Feb 2016 check out on 22nd Feb 2016 On Second day when we back to hotel at night We found the BIN BAG WITH THE RUBBISH INSIDE WERE ON THE DESK ESPECIALLY ON TOP OF THE FRUITS WE LEAVE IN THE PLATE How terrible We think we are quite lucky because of the cleaner took this mistake by forgeting take the bin bag away when she change it to a new one otherwise we will eat the fruits This is the very serious hygiene issue to make us risen the complain but there are few other issues we found in three days eg dirty mop left for TWO DAYS on the table of my friends room cups leave on the table without cleaning no one looks after the canteen downstairs and leave the kitchen unlocked and with the food inside When we raise the issues to the front desk manager he has no sense about how serious it is he keep explain to us he will ask the cleaning lady why she forgot take the Bin bag away after she change it And we need to explain to him we will accept this mistake if she only forget the bin bag in the room but we cannot accept she leave it on the table it doesn t really matter whether there has fruits or not And we did request to see the hotel manager but she refused to see us only ask us to send her a email and we did see her sit in the office when the front desk manager spoken to her The conclusion are 1 The hotel has very serious hygiene issues as well as healthy and safety issues 2 The hotel management is weak and not helpful 3 Best Western Group doesn t have basic training management and monitoring system in place not a reliable chained brand hotel at all We are not going to stay in any of the Best Western hotel at all in the future , The price is not bad and it is quite central as well

36204,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, Our room was laid out so that it was difficult to get around the bed so one of us was always knocking into things The room was compact which is normal for Paris but it seems like the furniture was designed for a larger room , The location was great for sightseeing and dinner options we walked everywhere 
36205,Best Western Premier Marais Grands Boulevards, First room we stayed had a bad window isolation which cause wind blowing through it As a bed is quite close to the window it was rather disturbing Hotel is on a street with heavy traffic , Location is amazing You can walk to Luvre within 20 mins There is a metro station Saint Denis 60 meters from the hotel You can reach whatever place from it Hotel is on the edge of Mare district full of restaurants shops etc Cozy place Rooms are recently renovated feels good
