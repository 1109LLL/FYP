211211,Hilton London Angel Islington, The dinning area looked a little shabby and we were all disappointed to see so many dreadful plastic plants It s not hard to make an effort with a little real greenary considering how much it costs to stay there , The rooms were lovely The breakfast was wonderful Staff helpful and happy 
211212,Hilton London Angel Islington, We always had clean bath and hand towels but we had to ask for the little face towels each day I was unclear as to whether we were supposed to receive 2 bottles of water and a bottle of wine each day we received it the first and last days only Just confused , The location was excellent Even though there was an acid attack on Upper Street the day before I felt totally safe in the neighborhood 
211213,Hilton London Angel Islington,No Negative, Very clean hotel with everything you could need In an excellent location and the Upper street car park is fantastic being underneath the Hilton and you get discounted rate of 1 per hour Smooth checking in and out Highly recommended 
211214,Hilton London Angel Islington, Had to move rooms after the first night then on the second night we were gave a key to someone else s room and woke them up staff didn t really know what was going on and it took about 40 mins to check in, Rooms were comfortable
211215,Hilton London Angel Islington, the view of my room bad housekeeping services like missing tissue paper none bottle of water the second day and third day of staying dirty towels remain in the washroom after housekeeping service, Location
211216,Hilton London Angel Islington, There was a problem with the plug in the bath which stuck so you couldn t empty it most days As a result water leaked and made the carpet wet outside bathroom door I think that this problem must occur regularly and needs a permanent solution rather than calling an engineer plumber out very day Someone came quickly every time but would be much better if it didn t happen ,No Positive
211217,Hilton London Angel Islington, Everything was good, I was in London to support my daughter through potentially life threatening surgery and was therefore more emotional than usual I found the staff extremely compassionate without losing their professionalism and the hotel provided exactly what I needed during a very stressful time 
211218,Hilton London Angel Islington,No Negative, The team on the front desk were really helpful and assisted our complex plans prior to our son s wedding Everything was organised as we requested They went above the call of duty to make sure our stay was enjoyable and part of a really memorable weekend 
211219,Hilton London Angel Islington, Dispute over the bill at the Hilton could have been settled on site but was not, Excellent bars and restaurants in the area I can recommend Cote restaurant on Islington Green for good value food and excellent service
211220,Hilton London Angel Islington, Slightly expensive otherwise a great locoation for London and accessible to many areas , Breakfast was fantastic great options for children too especially the pancakes and maple syrup 
211221,Hilton London Angel Islington, The room did not have a view an window difficult to open hense really needed the air conditioning , Bed very comfortable an room spacious We really appreciated the good air conditioning as the weather was roasting 
211222,Hilton London Angel Islington, Though clean and up to date the rooms are very small and tight The breakfast did not match up the the standards I would expect from a hotel of this calibre cold hard bacon very little in the way of bread rolls viennoiserie poor choice of yoghurts and fruit , Hotel is well placed for us visiting family in the area The rooms were very clean and modern and the bar restaurant an oasis in what is a very busy part of London 
211223,Hilton London Angel Islington, No complaints, Did not sample the food since there were so many restaurants within five minute walk Room initial night was very cramped but was upgraded to a very comfortable larger room for next several nights Front desk staff especially Rita Marques went above and beyond Chose this hotel since it is about two minute walk from my son who lives on Islington Green Over all my wife and I were very pleased 
211224,Hilton London Angel Islington, The mattress was so uncomfortable and caused a very sore back and tiredness which was not at all helpful for the business we were there for over the 2 days stay You should take a look at the the Premier Inn as I would rate their beds as being total comfort and 100 better than what we experienced at the Hilton and we were not the only ones with the same view point at breakfast this spoil t the Hilton experience for us and other guests we spoke to , location and friendly staff 
211225,Hilton London Angel Islington, There was a flashing red light on the ceiling in the bedroom probably smoke alarm that was very annoying They should put this away from the bed otherwise it keeps you awake, Location was excellent
211226,Hilton London Angel Islington, The rate in Euros calculated by bookings was 343 for two nights It turned out that the hotel does not accept normal banking cards type maestro nor does it accept a payment upon your departure Of course I was not informed about the payment limitation so I had to take out 298 pounds that it was equivalent to 377 euros The hotel declined any responsibility as the reservation was made via bookings I will not return to this hotel again as I find this outrageous for a 4 star hotel ,No Positive
211227,Hilton London Angel Islington, Check out very slow as only one person on duty but she managed in a very professional manner , Staff very welcoming and friendly Spacious room towels changed every day and high quality toiletries replaced on regular basis TV wasn t working but after speaking to reception problem was quickly resolved Great location for variety of bars and restaurants and only 5 min walk to underground

211237,Hilton London Angel Islington, I asked 3 times 3 different people for a sheet on my bed all told me that they would put a sheet on the bed I hate not having a sheet on the bed The duvet is too heavy and makes me too hot Finally my wife had to go the next day to the front desk to complain since we did not get a sheet the previous day and ask again for a sheet Finally a housekeeper showed up that could not speak English and asked what we wanted and when we told her she proceeded to take the cover of the duvet After pointing and trying to communicate in English we finally got her to go and bring us back a couple of sheets She still did not understand and simply just handed me the sheets expecting me to make the bed Please consider your bedding options and provide at least one sheet not just a duvet The AC does not go below 18 so if a person is hot no AC no sheet VERY uncomfortable , Location The breakfast and bar service

211242,Hilton London Angel Islington, Only two teabags provided in our room per day Noisy and unruly children football team in the breakfast room each morning Hotel staff were doing their best to minimise the inconvenience to other guests but the childrensminders seemed totally unconcerned about the disruptive behaviour of their charges , Our room was surprisingly quiet and provided us with everything we needed The shower was nice and roomy The hotel was very well located for restaurants Staff friendly and helpful

211244,Hilton London Angel Islington, We would have liked a changed menu in the dining room for different evenings , Didn t have any croissants Beds very comfortable Staff at reception very pleasant and friendly We chose the hotel in particular because it has very good bus service very close so that we could very easily travel most days between where we were and our family in North London 
211245,Hilton London Angel Islington,No Negative, Excellent hotel in trendy Islington Modern comfortable clean and very well equipped rooms Staff pleasant and extremely helpful organised taxis left luggage etc

211247,Hilton London Angel Islington, Staff was reluctant to serve any drinks on arrival after travelling for 4 hours and heavily pregnant Instead told us to walk to the shops into the Main Street We called back into concierge to see if there was any chance our room may have been ready before 3pm and their abrupt reply was definately not They secured 255 from my bank account which was fine as they explained but on my arrival home they has secured an additional 30 I rang up to ask why and the person was adamant that it was not true despite clearly saying on my online banking She later went on to say she could see it had been taken but gave me no explanation and wait it would be returned to my account in 1 week,No Positive
211248,Hilton London Angel Islington, The bed was hard not comfortable at all On the booking form I requested non feather pillows Reception did not have any record of this so I had to ask for the pillows to be changed Room key card did not work had to go all the way back to reception with my luggage to get it to be reset Pain , The room service was excellent quick on time and very good 
211249,Hilton London Angel Islington, Parking was ridiculously expensive when there was another closer and cheaper option Noise from heating in the room was annoying and impacted sleep Heating was way too hot and thermostat was kept reverting back No breakfast in room as we had not ordered the night before Phone in room was not working and had to call reception form my Australian mobile really annoyed me as I have a child with me so not easy to pop down to reception in the early morning Staff were lovely but clueless and needed training as check in took 25mins and room not ready or with a cot as requested on booking , Location was ace and rooms were nice 
211250,Hilton London Angel Islington, The bed was really hard found it very difficult to sleep and the window was difficult to shut The light switch arrangement was poor and very confusing When trying to switch on the bathroom light in the middle of the night I had to flick the master switch because we d used the bedside master to turn the lights off in one go This turned on every single light in the room waking my partner , The muffins at breakfast were delicious
211251,Hilton London Angel Islington, The taxi limo they recommended charged me 20 for a round trip to a store approx 1 5 miles away from the hotel his wait time was less than 5 mins while I popped in and back out , The staff were helpful and attentive

211256,Hilton London Angel Islington, I didn t like that the room was too warm for my taste I did turn the heating down to the lowest it would go but I would have liked to make it cooler than 18C for sleeping or been able to open the window Surprisingly I didn t find the bed super comfortable It was a bit too firm and lumpy in places , Breakfast was delicious I found the porridge on the second day Everywhere was spotlessly clean and I m very fussy so that is a deal breaker for me I liked that the staff greet guests and take care to learn what you like and need Bathroom was roomy and modern and everything worked properly My room was super quiet which was brilliant And the lighting was good lots of hotels forget that we need reading lights but the Hilton s LED lamps are very good and in the right place Very nice quality linen and towels

211261,Hilton London Angel Islington, There was nothing better about the accommodation than one would get at a Premier Inn The bar in the evening and breakfast in the morning were less good than at a Premier Inn , The staff were friendly and efficient The room was all right 
211262,Hilton London Angel Islington, My room was on the first floor not served by lift and we had to go up by twelve stairs When I made the reservation I said lifts were required as my wife has dificulties to go up and down trough stairs When I claimed the receptionist told me to change the room was available but as we had already used the room and emptied the bags So we decided to remain there , Room was very confortable and breakfast was very good

211269,Hilton London Angel Islington, Bedbugs Took pillows with bugs on to show reception staff two days running The staff were sympathetic but this is a serious problem for any hotel as bedbugs quickly spread unless thorough fumigation is carried out ,No Positive
211270,Hilton London Angel Islington, The toiletries were rather stingy half used body lotion and the shower cap split on opening , Very comfortable and quiet room The location of the hotel was ideal for Sadler s Wells Angel tube station and many restaurants all within easy walking distance Staff were very helpful and friendly

211272,Hilton London Angel Islington, Breakfast is a buffet so it s never going to be as good as if it were individually freshly prepared , Friendly receptionists and great location to get in and out of the theatre district Also not mainly expensive for a quality hotel 
211273,Hilton London Angel Islington, Maybe next time clarify that room service for breakfast is chargeable Apart from that all else was fine , The hotel is a good distance from the station and the breakfast was wonderful
211274,Hilton London Angel Islington, The drinking glasses in the room had not been cleaned One glass contained clear fluid and the other glass was dirty I mentioned it to the receptionist at checkouthe The shower head did not stay in place and I had to hold it by hand, Friendly staff good mattress quiet room

211279,Hilton London Angel Islington,No Negative, Excellent location a few minutes walk from Angel Underground The hotel is set back from the Main Street so it is very quiet but with a huge choice of restaurants and bars virtually on the doorstep We had a fantastic view of the city skyline from our room Upon arrival only one of the rooms was ready and after heading out for a walk and returning at 5pm it still wasn t ready The receptionist gave us access to the executive lounge so we could wait there and extended the access for the whole of our stay Even though we didn t have a chance to use the lounge again it was a very nice gesture and immediately turned an unhappy client into a happy one 
211280,Hilton London Angel Islington,No Negative, Terrific value Spacious comfortable quality furnishings even a fridge Breakfast very good Close to underground own car park pricey but very convenient 
211281,Hilton London Angel Islington, The mirror in the bathroom is too high as im only 5 FT But there are other mirrors in the room A mirror could be over the table area for applying make up , The room had everything bed was comfortable and the miniature toiletries were good quality too 
211282,Hilton London Angel Islington, Everything was perfect We relaxed with family and friends in late afternoon early evening in hotel bar , We stayed at this hotel due to location Our daughter was married at Islington town hall All walk away The staff were most accommodating We booked a room for our daughter too and staff very obligingly had their room ready early We requested a travel cot for our year old grandson which was delivered earlier when requested 
211283,Hilton London Angel Islington, Early morning 6 00 wheelie bin cleaning outside my room which woke me earlier than I had intended too Reported this to reception , My room was modern clean with large twin beds good storage coffee and tea making and good bathroom facilities A good breakfast was included and comprised of cooked and continental options

211291,Hilton London Angel Islington,No Negative, Great room large firm bed with beautiful sheets powerful shower Great location close to gig venues and Angel tube station Great price that includes breakfast Perfect for gigs concerts in the Angel Islington area Hard to fault for the price paid 
211292,Hilton London Angel Islington, Nothing , The efficiency friendliness of all staff especially a lovely Italian receptionist who made us feel so welcome Unfortunately I did not know her name The cleanliness of our room was also very apparent We had a wonderful stay at this hotel 
211293,Hilton London Angel Islington, Room requested not available Waited 1 2 to be shown different room Then assured sofa bed was comfortable Absolutely dreadful springs literally left marks on the body Ended up sleeping on the floor on top of a duvet ,No Positive
211294,Hilton London Angel Islington, Bed was very hard just tempered by the mattress topper On second day I asked for milk 4 times in total and the male supervisor in his suit quite clearly thought it was below him Chef was not on top of the cooked breakfast and many people ended up hanging around for missing items of food , Location was great Staff leave you with a full coffee pot at breakfast so you don t have to keep calling them back Staff were polite Check in out were quick Room was good shower was great Tea and coffe was well stocked and an empty fridge to keep your wine in 
211295,Hilton London Angel Islington, The bed was horrendous It was so hard that I woke up every morning sore all over no exaggeration The pillows were lumpy and uncomfortable I guess you need to pay for more than a basic room to get the Hilton comfort So disappointing , Superb breakfast
211296,Hilton London Angel Islington, We had adjoining doors and our neighbours were a bit noisy , The staff were all very friendly it was a great location for kings cross and our trip to spittle fields Very comfy bed and nice soft pillows 
211297,Hilton London Angel Islington, Lot of building work going on in the reception area which was very dusty and noisy Had arranged a couple of very late family nights in Islington and tried to catch up on some sleep in the afternoon Unfortunately the noisy drilling work made this impossible ,No Positive

211299,Hilton London Angel Islington, The varied prices for a glass of wine at the bar Anything from 4 75 to 9 25 For the same wine , The bed and pillows were the most comfortable I ve ever slept in 
211300,Hilton London Angel Islington, Firstly no attention was paid to our very advanced booking requesting a higher external room They put us in an internal room next to the lift and only after complaining did they change our room Secondly they claimed that they didn t receive request through booking com and yet would only book a second night through your site Make any sense It leaves the impression of being a very impersonally run hotel where money counts more than customer satisfaction , Breakfast was quite good 
211301,Hilton London Angel Islington, Having 3 children we had to pay for two rooms which was very expensive our bed was too small we have a superking at home The room smelled of damp our complimentary water was not replaced for our second nights stay Considering 800 spent i expect more ,No Positive
211302,Hilton London Angel Islington, The desk service was impersonal and inattentive at times and officious at others The restaurant supervisor was rude and aggressive which was a pity as the food for breakfast was great The attitude of the staff seemed to be that they were doing us a big favour letting us stay there When you add breakfast parking internet umbrella loan etc to the base cost of the room it ends up being a pricey place to stay It was our second time staying and it was also our last , The Hotel is in a very convenient place close to Angel station and Islington high street The rooms are good clean and have very comfortable beds The food at breakfast and via room service is great and reasonably priced 
211303,Hilton London Angel Islington, Expensive and the hot breakfast food was kept in dishes that untouchably hot , Wonderful staff good sized room and bathroom Very comfortable bed The curtains made it actually dark and there was no external noise 
211304,Hilton London Angel Islington, Liked everything, Location excellent for transport choices eating places bars So good to leave busy city centre after sightseeing museum visits Coffee etc amply replenished daily Staff friendly but professional 
211305,Hilton London Angel Islington, Breakfast was served until 11 so mooched down about 10 20 and there was only one poor chap on cooked breakfasts Rubbery eggs oily sausages no hash browns and my bacon arrived at the end of my meal checked out and went to Pret for brunch, The 12 o clock check out meant that we didn t have to get up early on a Sunday and after a party that was very welcome 
211306,Hilton London Angel Islington,No Negative, Ambience and standard of hotel were excellent Clean and comfortable rooms Friendliness and customer service ethic of the staff was variable during the weekend The lady who was front of house at breakfast on Sunday morning 16th October was brilliant pro active friendly informative and smiling 
211307,Hilton London Angel Islington, The car parking is the only downside of this excellently run hotel We stayed from Friday lunchtime to Saturday evening 70 is a an excessive charge for a car park not full Although not Hilton owned the NCP is the only one available So close to the Hotel , The triumph of this hotel is the staff really helpful from helping an early check in to sorting late nite food Not the average london service a cut above Top rate for cleanliness 
211308,Hilton London Angel Islington, Would be nice to have leisure facilities Was quite expensive but as we were there for a wedding it was v convenient for us, Locality loved Islington Bed and pillows great Only had b fast once but v good Had meal on first night a group of 15 good food

211311,Hilton London Angel Islington, Nothing Helpful staff clean modern well equipped hotel what more do you want Ok if you push me the bar drinks were a bit pricey , Standard hotel buffet breakfast but at a very reasonable price Good selection of hot and cold items Room was reasonably spacious and well equipped The drench shower in the bathroom was fantastic really woke you up in the morning Walk out onto Upper St and fall over one restaurant and coffee shop bakery etc after another Brilliant 
211312,Hilton London Angel Islington, Basin sink plug did not seal properly No sign off Upper Street to show location of hotel , Bed was very comfortable Room was very well equipped overall Hotel was quiet and relaxing
