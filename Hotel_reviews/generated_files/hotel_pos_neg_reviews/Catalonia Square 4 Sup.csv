433203,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, I have been there for 5 nights start from 4 July 2017 I booked two rooms and it was nice and overpriced the hotel location is near Catalonia plaza and ramblas street breakfast is below average breakfast staff was rude although I stayed for 5 nights and I did not see them smiling room service was poor stay again NO, location
433204,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, Nothing, The staff on check in were very friendly and helpful We had booked a separate room for our teenage sons and had requested a twin close to our room as they didn t have a twin room available they upgraded us to junior suites so they could be adjacent to us and use the sofa bed as the second bed very thoughtful The pool and outdoor sun deck although small was perfect to chill on after a day walking around the city They also have a buffet selection of hot and cold snacks available for free from 2pm 11pm a very nice touch The hotel is in a perfect location for sightseeing etc 
433205,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, Overall very satisfied except about one staff We wanted to book a taxi to the airport at 6 00 am the next day The staff asked our room number and said ok without making any notes He said he would take care of it later Yet at night time when we came back to the hotel we reconfirmed with the counter staff about our booking To our surprise it was not done , Excellent locations for guests who will join local tours as easy access to gathering points 
433206,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, Tea water was either stale or just not warm a really bad cup of tea , Food was good but tea needs to be hot when you make it for drinking Apple cake was very nice

433217,Catalonia Square 4 Sup,No Negative, From its street appearance you would not expect much from this property The street frontage is small and unpretentious Once you are inside you are in for a surprise Our room was spacious and had two balconies The walk in shower was luxurious An unexpected bonus was the free buffet they put out from 2 to 11 p m but the best part was the attentiveness of the staff We had planned to meet a tour guide in the Plaza Catalonia but we were unsure about how to identify him so the bellboy actually walked with us to the plaza and found our guide in the crowd of people in this very busy plaza

433230,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, Nothing, This was our 2nd stay at the hotel and we are still very happy with our experience Joan Kenia Diego and Rachid made sure of that The manager at that time I didn t get his name allowed us a late check out until our car pick up service arrived at 5 30pm The service of the hotel is above and beyond Highly recommended

433232,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, A very personal thing but room too dark for me I am not keen on seductive low lighting I did not like just having sheets instead of a quilt It was cold in April but there were blankets , The hotel was very clean decorated beautifully The buffet was a great buffet after walking the city all day Bathroom and facilities good Staff very helpful and pleasant Excellent position for sightseeing

433236,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, The main week point of the hotel is by far its bathroom If it s not for the bathroom I would have given it a perfect 10 The bathroom has glass walls O O It was very very weird Too much intimacy and embarrassment The glass door isn t fully shut no lock no real door frame which means you can hear everything that s going on inside Also you can t take a shower or go to the bathroom without your partner in the room seeing you Of course that s a vague image and not a completely clear glass but still very weird and embarrassing Also if you want to go to the bathroom at night and you turn on the light you are in fact light up the entire room and for people like me that sleep lightly it s a deal breaker Every time my wife wanted to go to the bathroom she had to wake me up because of the light Other than that the hotel is amazing I wish for them they would change this weird setup of a bathroom That s for me the main reason for not recommending anybody to go there and it s such an amazing hotel besides that That s such a shame , The Catalonia Square is an absolute amazing hotel Greatly located right near by Plaza De Catalunya and the metro stop Also it s very accessible from the airport using the Aerobus The staff was really nice and helpful And the free buffet in the lobby that includes all sorts of foods sandwiches salads cakes coffee tea all sorts of cold beverages etc was really good

433240,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, Nothing I recommend to purchase Barcelona Visitors Pass that allows free access to museums buses , Location is excellent Customer Service was excellent I would recommend this hotel It is well worth the money We arrived late but the front office staff came out and got our bags right up to the room right away

433252,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, Breakfast was fairly expensive 19 per person Given the high standard of everything else in the room the sheets felt remarkably cheap and not particularly comfortable We had a junior suite which was laid out somewhat oddly the toilet and shower opened directly onto the main room meaning very little privacy not a problem for a married couple but still potentially awkward for others , Location was phenomenal No problems with noise despite being on a major street in a heavily trafficked part of town Staff very friendly and eager to help even late at night Breakfast was delicious Spacious room with free water every day Hotel has free snacks sandwiches cookies fruit etc available from late morning until late at night every day amazing little perk and great for tiding one over until late Spanish dinners Would be delighted to stay here again 
433253,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, Rooms are a bit tiny as common in Barcelona, Free snack buffet and open use printer was a nice touch Location is superb connected to everywhere Got a complementary welcome dessert upon arrival and chocolates on bed every night All members of staff were super friendly and helpful 
433254,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, A little quiet could have music little louder in the eating area would have loved a cappuccino only coffee but otherwise excellent, Great location close to metro and airport shuttle lively hotel the free snacks were a lovely bonus during the day

433263,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, Room was ok but toiletries like shower gel and shampoo were awful plus they were even stingy with it not replacing a quarter full tiny bottle of shower gel and completely forgetting to replace it on another occasion, Service staff very friendly and helpful we were allowed early check in and late check out with no fuss Location of hotel is excellent very close to Placa Catulunya and just across from the biggest department store Cortes

433266,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, Would have liked the bed to be softer , The entire hotel has a very modern style and is very clean Great location as we visited many of the sites in Barcelona without using a bus or taxi We only took a taxi for the Sagrada Familia and to get to the beach Also the room we were in provided a second door in the entry way of our room that we used at night to help silence any noise by other guests Not sure if the second door was necessary but we never heard any noises from other guests 
433267,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, Doors are thin you can hear other guests when passing by , Great location Staff are super friendly clean rooms comfortable beds loved the snack bar and although breakfast is limited and at a cost but it s everything you need to start your day Many thanks Yolanda and Sergio you ve made my trip

433273,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, Ran out of red wine, The complimentary tapas were unexpected but great Never bought dinner Location perfect Upgraded to the best room in the hotel Big and had a vast rooftop view of the Gothic Quarter and Cantalonia Square Breathtaking 
433274,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, The beautiful pool terrace was in the shade all day and no drinks facility available The pool was icy cold There was MOULD growing on both jugs of lemonade and iced tea in the gym The hot water coffee machine was painfully slow which made the tea lukewarm by the time it had filled the pot The step up and down from our room 702 was very high and in fact dangerous if it was dark or wet The late check out facility could be managed better I asked the question about a late check out on booking the hotel and never received a response When asking at the reception 24 hours before checkout I could not get a yes or no answer Eventually we had checkout at 1pm instead of 12 noon but couldn t confirm this until 9am on the day which isn t very helpful , Both rooms 404 702 were beautifully clean and well maintained The beds were comfortable although very tightly tucked in making it difficult to get under the covers Afternoon snacks were generous tasty and very welcome Great location for central Barcelona La Rambla shopping tours cafes etc Beach was not so close but cheap in a taxi 
433275,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, The only negative thing about my stay was the noisy cleaners in the hallway when I had do not disturb sign on There was a staff closet probably supply closet next to my room where they frequently slammed the door and either a mop or a vacuum cleaner kept hitting the walls outside the room Not very considerate , Location is excellent only a few meters from the Catalunya Square Free buffet from 14 00 24 00 was outstanding never seen anything like that before Room is big nice and clean with great bathroom and staff very friendly and helpful 
433276,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, Not really a dislike just thought I had booked a room with a balcony that you could sit out on but turned out I should have requested a terrace The hotel would have moved us at a cost but didn t have terraced room with twin beds, All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly The free snacks drinks everyday were very welcome on returning from long hot days sightseeing Also the clean towels and toiletries twice a day The location is convenient for Plaza Catalunya Las Ramblas and only 7 in taxi to beach 
433277,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, Nothing, Everything about this hotel was perfect we got a room overlooking Catalonia Square The rooms were very spacious clean and comfortable The inclusive snacks and soft drinks from 2pm until 10pm were fabulous The reception staff where amazing nothing was too much trouble and especially Xavi seemed to go the extra mile

433279,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, The partition between the bedroom and bath is glass Could be made to provide more privacy , 1 The staff could not be more gentle knowledgeable and helpful They are an example of professional standards and support in every way 2 The location is ideal right in the centre of town 3 Free of charge refreshments and sandwichesplus crisps and nuts in the loungecwere proof of good hospitality and even generosity 
433280,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, Checkin Had to wait an full hour for my room after I arrived right at the time checkin was possible The gut at the reception told me about such a busy day while the whole time waiting ONE other couple arrived everything else was really nice , Great location nice and clean room would definitely recommend this place

433284,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, Price was a bit high Specially the first night , Very happy with all Specially with staff Ms Kenia Escalonte was so amazing Very kind and intelligent Responsibility and taking care of us in highly level as much 
433285,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, somber colours boxed in feeling of both rooms and dining area pool lacks atmosphere and is closed all the time few if any qualities that make it stand out therefore not worthy of a 4 star sup quotation, excellent location good soundproofing of rooms very clean hotel decent enough free internet
433286,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, This property overpriced One of the worst property I ever stayed in the Spain rooms are too small a lot of stuff in the rooms was not working the staff tells you one thing they do another in willing o help I think all the reviews was they put in was fake I do not recommend it to anyone ,No Positive

433290,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, No complaints about the hotel just some obnoxious guests sharing our same floor , The staff was very helpful and acommodating Our room was very stylish and had a comfy bed What impressed me most was that while we did have breakfast included in the cost of our room they had a free light buffet for all guests from noon until 8 00p m which we took advantage of Also we had some large luggage with us and they agreed to store 2 of our bags for several days free of charge while we took a short trip north on the train before coming back to Barcelona Great location and great hotel 
433291,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, Rooms were not sound proof from the inside of the hotel and I could hear guests and staff talking loudly in the corridors It requires 2 elevators to reach the rooms which is an inconvenience I booked a room based on the fact that it had a balcony but unfortunately they had none of those rooms available and with a small additional fee I was upgraded on the 3rd day to a great room , Hotel was in a great location clean fast wifi and had free snacks through out the day Staff are helpful and friendly Great value for money 
433292,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, Design of the rooms were nice but bit cold The staff was very friendly but a bit fake You constantly have the feeling that they not trust you Just sit somewhere and they already come to ask your room number Overall good hotel but price quality not so right rather a 3 s rating for my opinion , Nice rooms Climatisation system was perfect Double windows so no noice from the street Free snacks in the restaurant but due to the attitude of staff it looks like nobody dare to touch it

433305,Catalonia Square 4 Sup, The only real draw back for us was the pool next door did smell eggy occasionally it wasn t for long and it was fixed but it is a negative to be noted if you were wanting to sit on the balcony for hours it could cause you more of a problem Other than that minor issue the stay was 10 10 , When we arrived we were warmly welcomed the check in was quick and smooth We were taken to our room which was on the 8th floor it was one of only two rooms in the hotel with a balcony this provided the most amazing place to relax at any time of day The view was great and was generally a nice place to sit The size of the room was brilliant plenty of space for us to relax when we weren t out in the city In comparison to other hotels I ve stayed in the features were just that bit better the TV size kettle iron ironing board and the desk area that allowed us to explore the maps for places to visit just made the experience that bit better My main positives would be the proximity we were able to walk to the square in less than a minute this is where the best shops restaurants and travel links were including two metro stations tour buses and taxis unlike other hotels it offered breakfast to 12 00 and then a free buffet from 14 00 00 00 this was great for us as we could grab some food and then relax in the pool The pool was quiet and had it to ourselves most of the time this was also the same for the gym which was very well air conditioned much like the room A real little bit of paradise in the centre of an amazing city i ll be visiting again in the future
