193123,Novotel London Blackfriars, Pillows poor quality and only one extra in the wardrobe for the price of the hotel expected better and for a queen size bed seemed small , Actually being able to open the window and the bathroom wall being transparent or smoked with the push of a button

193125,Novotel London Blackfriars, Jacuzzi cold 1st room was invaded by appalling odour of cigarettes in the early hours of the first morning Staff changed our room with no problem Impossible to put bathroom light on without bathing the bedroom in light Sometimes wood is better than magic glass , Nice room and breakfast Staff very friendly Perfect location near to the underground and river 
193126,Novotel London Blackfriars, When I checked in my room I was shocked to see that the garbage bin was not emptied and to add insult to injury it has condoms thrown in it I was really devasted then I took a shower and was surprised that the toilet seat plastic cover was also not well cleaned and had some kind of smudges on it the last problem was the shower towel that had a brown spot the size of a quarter on it that I am not sure if it is dirt or something else The staff were very responsive to what happened and apologized and the even deducted some money from my charges not the whole night for free though and they all properly apologized but I paid more than 200 per night I expect better hygiene the bed was very uncomfortable because it was a big bed but made from 2 small mattresses put next to each other so you would spend most of the night sleeping in the crevice between both mattresses, I liked the location and proximity to my business meeting as well as tube station
193127,Novotel London Blackfriars, Nothing at all , What can i say the novotel hotel was so friendly clean vibrant The staff where very friendly informative and polite at all times our room was a great size clean and tidy with nice views

193132,Novotel London Blackfriars, Had to use hotel to call taxi severally due to no cabs being available on street Recommended taxi hailing apps required UK telephone number Bus stop right outside and tube station a walking distance from the hotel though , Helpful friendly staff Great breakfast and swimming pool Rain shower 
193133,Novotel London Blackfriars, All I would say was the swimming pool We went to enjoy a little swim but pool was cold Could do with being warmer but apart from this no bad feedback, Location was great also the staff very friendly and always willing to help Always had smiles on their faces
193134,Novotel London Blackfriars, WiFi not the best in rooms disappointing view from family room , Lovely bathroom situated next to several tube station shops and restaurants Decent size room for London Was allowed to check in and dump the bags in our room at 10am and checked out and they held our bags untill late Sunday

193136,Novotel London Blackfriars, Bed was small and needed extra bedding Lots of kids in the pool meant it wasn t relaxing at all , Very good breakfast Bed very soft Nice bathroom
193137,Novotel London Blackfriars, The double bed was not that comfortable was a bit too soft Also did not have enough pillows There should have been more milk and sugar provided with the tea coffee and also hot chocolate for the children and a bottle of water in the fridge , Loved the swimming pool jacuzzi its great towels were provided Loved the breakfast that was included with our stay Room was a good size for a family room The children liked the frosted bathroom wall switch The room was lovely and warm cozy 
193138,Novotel London Blackfriars, Breakfast was shocking I ordered to our room as a surprise for my husband birthday it was cold and look like it had been sitting there for a while paid extra for this and really was disappointed I would have complained but there was a few people checking out at reception and needed to get back to carpark before ticket run out , The Hotel was lovely and clean Loved the pool and sauna Had a lovely weekend for my Husbands birthday 
193139,Novotel London Blackfriars, Room was missing a bath to sit down and relax in Also the main shower head we could not get to work The 50 50 soft firm pillows were awkward for sleeping on especially for me who prefers just firm pillows , Room was very clean Staff were polite and helpful when checking in and out and for any other information that was needed Speaker in the room was great and being able to connect a laptop to the TV to watch films was a great addition 
193140,Novotel London Blackfriars, The bacon for breakfast could have been a bit more well done , I particularly liked the Jamboree Bar it was a quite pleasant with friendly efficient staff 
193141,Novotel London Blackfriars, The bed could have been slightly more comfortable I would prefer slightly softer but this is a very minor gripe in an otherwise great stay , The swimming pool sauna facilities are exceptional and the staff were very friendly throughout the stay The location is excellent to get anywhere around London with Blackfriars and Southwark tube stations so close by The views from the higher floors of the building overlooking the city are breathtaking 
193142,Novotel London Blackfriars, No bath robes or slippers upon arrival in room no birthday room after ringing 7 times to do something special also took 50 per room and made me overdrawn, Bed comfy
193143,Novotel London Blackfriars, The rooms were not set up for the number of people staying in them Had to request extra glasses cups etc and also for beds to be made up One of the reasons we selected this hotel was for the top floor restaurant disappointed to be told that it was open for corporate use only Ground floor restaurant was also closed on one of the nights as there was a small private gathering Ate elsewhere so hotel lost the benefit of our custom Bar was very lively but loud Regarding car parking we were given info on car parks about 1 2 miles away from hotel Took us longer looking for these than it did travelling down from Shrewsbury When we did find them One was closed and the other two did not have access for high sided vehicles Fortunately a member of our party managed to locate a car park 400 yards from hotel which was very reasonably priced Hopefully hotel have taken this on board , Swimming pool although a bit cold Location Good comfortable beds Once car parking and rooms were sorted we did have an enjoyable stay and would actually recommend this hotel to others pending restaurant being accessible

193145,Novotel London Blackfriars, Nothing, On arrival we was greeted by a very polite and helpful gentleman who booked us in He asked what we had planned whilst here when I explained it was my partners birthday on the following day to which we then got complimentary breakfast for the morning and an upgrade to an executive suite When we got to our room the view was clear of the shard it was amazing we couldn t of been more please The following morning we went for breakfast which was lovely went back to our room and had a knock on the door to find a member of staff saying she understands it is my partners birthday we had left the restaurant before they had chance to bring out a chocolate brownie with strawberries and kiwi so she had brought it up to our room Our experience of this hotel was above and beyond and I would certainly recommend We will 100 be coming back when we re next in London 
193146,Novotel London Blackfriars, House keeping staff woke my kids up at just after 9a m asking what time we are leaving When the checkout time is clearly mentioned in the booking which is 12 noon why would someone disturb customer for their own benefit so they can clean the room sooner , Everything
193147,Novotel London Blackfriars, The musics, The location is great and the people who work there are very friendly I just don t understand why there was Spanish music all the time 
193148,Novotel London Blackfriars, Unfortunately one of the receptionists was terrible Instead of checking the system or asking reservation dividion she just asked me to make all the payment again even though I booked the room with the payment already it gave me negative impression on hotel and the city , Close to Southwark station Metro Tesco
193149,Novotel London Blackfriars,No Negative, The staff was so accommodating when we needed to check our bags prior to check in and after check out to help accommodate our travel plans The breakfast buffet was very solid The location just south of the Thames was a manageable walking distance to Blackfriar s Bridge and the adjacent riverwalk scene The Southwark Tube station made transfer to the airport super easy on the day we left London 
193150,Novotel London Blackfriars,No Negative, We had a wonderful stay the hotel really went above and beyond to make sure our first family holiday to London was as exciting as we had hoped for I had asked the hotel to provide a little birthday wish for my 10 year old son and they really made sure to acknowledge him and give that little extra touch which makes such a difference Thanks to the staff

193163,Novotel London Blackfriars, Bathroom has a frosted glass wall that turns clear when you put the light on So not great privacy Later found if you use the light outside the bathroom it stays frosted but not the best Bathroom doors are folding , Great location minutes away from tube Hotel was lovely and breakfast was good although we had to queue each day to get into the restaurant to eat Staff were helpful and the pool was good although water in the jacuzzi was cold I would definitely staff again

193167,Novotel London Blackfriars, I had a problem with the service in the restaurant which I complained about and they gave me a refund so it was resolved I found the portion size on the tortellini very small for the price and for an evening meal, Excellent room fab view of Shard from 13 floor if you ask for a window on Blackfriars road enjoyed experimenting with the krups coffee machine the bathroom was sensational
193168,Novotel London Blackfriars, Staff clearly didn t listen to my special requests when I booked Breakfast served until 11am but at 10am hardly anything left not replenished , Rooms are lovely

193176,Novotel London Blackfriars, Breakfast was understaffed difficult to get coffee utensils hotel was pretty full and while food was good it appeared understaffed to deal with many people , Good location handy to Southwark and Waterloo stations Front desk staff very friendly and helpful Room clean and comfortable Breakfast food good 
193177,Novotel London Blackfriars, Hard to beat, Excellent staff who were always helpful and always someone available Super location only 5 minutes from Waterloo Station Taxi cost 5 from station Close to Thames St Paul s Cathedral bus and taxi just outside Premises were modern and near new and spacious room with walk in shower which I loved We had a meal at Doggett s Pub Restaurant and were able to look out over the Thames and watch the world go by They even left some fruit out by the lift on each floor We really enjoyed staying here 
193178,Novotel London Blackfriars, The food at breakfast was good and there was plenty of variety but the service was chaotic Both days there were no glasses for juice bowls for fruit cereal the hot drinks machine did not work the tables did not have full place settings and there seemed to be no one in charge as there is in other hotels to co ordinate the service , Good location close to underground station Clean good facilities Good wifi
193179,Novotel London Blackfriars, On 2 occasions on making up our room either the glasses were left as the previous night with drink still in them and also the tea and coffee was not replaced so had none the next morning when we went to look , Good location for site seeing and Metro station Wifi was excellent which helped for some work that had to be done

193184,Novotel London Blackfriars, The beds are not good as in BAD We asked to have collapsed mattress changed out Instead they moved us to a different room with an equally poor mattress This time with a mattress topper was provided in addition to the mattress so we stood the mattress against the wall and comfortably slept on the topper for the rest of our stay Couch cots in rooms are very comfortable Manager explained that the current mattresses have been there for three years and a hotel can only change them every five years or they ll lose money In short wait another two years to stay here or stay on the couch in a pinch , Perfectly lovely functional hotel Comfortable contemporary furnishings Well situated on South bank Pleasant clean pool gym and steam Responsive staff

193191,Novotel London Blackfriars, the manager in the breakfast room an arrogant and pretty incompetent guy who treats the staff direspectfully cue at breakfast which is totally not necessary because many tables available is simply a matter of bad organization skills some details of the breakfast itself e g yoghurt and butter should be placed on ice or in fridge table is a bit messy , pool staff check in room space fitness location near metro 
193192,Novotel London Blackfriars, The staff told us we could check in at 3pm and we waited to do so then when we turned up at the check in desks after 3pm they suddenly claimed we would have to wait longer which we were not initially told When we complained they immediately swapped us to another room that was available and apologised though so customer service is clearly very high , Very comfortable rooms bathrooms are particularly luxurious Food in the hotel restaurant was of a high quality Less than 10 minutes from Waterloo underground very close to all Southbank attractions 
193193,Novotel London Blackfriars, Slight que for breakfast but it was busy and staff were very accommodating , Fantastic location staff were friendly and helpful Wonderful room and facilities Pool was delightful Could not have been better 
193194,Novotel London Blackfriars, Would be great if you could put some lactose free or soya milk in the rooms for allergy sufferers , We have stayed in many London Hotels and found this to be one of the best so far The room was Modern and stylish and extremely clean We loved the shower room with the misting glass We had a lovely stay and the staff were helpful and welcoming 
193195,Novotel London Blackfriars,No Negative, Excellent accomodation good location near to underground rooms very clean and staff friendly and helpful We would definitely stay again and recommend 
193196,Novotel London Blackfriars, We arrived at 2 to be told our room was not ready for another half an hour which was very inconvenient but this was sorted out shortly after and we had another room found for us , Comfey bed 
193197,Novotel London Blackfriars, Closer parking could have been better Most hotel offer reduced rates for laundry of children s clothing That should be implemented in the hotel , The room cleaners could put in more effort We had to ask for sheets to change the bed 
193198,Novotel London Blackfriars,No Negative, Excellent place to reach lots of touristic places in walking distance A metro station was in 200m from hotel Staff were very nice and helpful Great breakfast with lots of choices And quite comfortable spacious and clean room concerning our 1 year old daughter 
193199,Novotel London Blackfriars,No Negative, A great hotel in a super location within easy walking distance to many of the top London sights Nearest tube station was literally one minute walk away and only 5 minutes walk to the embankment Spacious rooms with modern clean decor Particularly liked the bathroom and super comfy beds Value for money was excellent will definitely stay again 
193200,Novotel London Blackfriars, Lots of children in the pool And toilet bowl and the wash basin and the shower is very far away from arms reach Can be UnNerving, The spa pool is a draw factor 
193201,Novotel London Blackfriars, When I arrived there was a cot in my room rather than a chair or chesterfield but the staff replaced it within 48 hours , The breakfast was excellent consistent good quality The staff were very helpful and friendly The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom and shower were the perfect size Great location with easy walking distance to Waterloo Station and the Thames 
193202,Novotel London Blackfriars, Nothing apart from the mini bar only having water misled slightly on the upgrade being told the mini bar was free yes it was free but only bottled water all hotels supply bottled water , Everything was excellent
193203,Novotel London Blackfriars, Night light would be nice and more opaque bathroom wall to prevent light from entering bedroom from bathroom , Great American English breakfast much more extensive than expected Hotel is clean and modern with an upbeat vibe 
193204,Novotel London Blackfriars, We ordered breakfast through room service and it took just under to arrive It was then still in our room when we arrived back at 1am having been out all day And 6 in tray charges I felt was ridiculously overpriced , Nice hotel lovely bathroom facilities However completely overpriced for what it is
193205,Novotel London Blackfriars, Room cleaning was terrible we didn t get any extra towels or toilet rolls etc Used coffee cups were loft behind and other than the beds made it was hard to tell the room had been serviced at all , Friendly staff at reception and quick check out process 
193206,Novotel London Blackfriars, Service at breakfast was slow due to under staffing however buffet was good , Hotel was in good location close to attractions Would recommend the Jamboree bar and all the excellent staff in particular the Chamo and Laurent who entertained us every time we visited 
193207,Novotel London Blackfriars, You see that Novotel is reality trying to cut costs on little things such as staff reception and overall services , It is clean location is practical The room are spacious and don t lack anything Decoration is great and fancy 
193208,Novotel London Blackfriars, Minor point the food choice in the Jamboree was a bit limited , Nice room helpful staff Comfortable bed Location was very good quiet room as requested Good breakfast Will stay again 
193209,Novotel London Blackfriars, At breakfast there was one little and temperamental machine to get tea and coffee long queues it was annoying, The location was great right next to south bank the pool and sauna were lovely and the rooms were really clean
193210,Novotel London Blackfriars, Loud thumping music in the pool and sauna not relaxing The carpet in my room was a bit stained and worse the desk chair so stained I didn t want to look at it let alone sit on it , Enjoyed the pool and sauna Nice breakfast in attractive surroundings Pleasant helpful staff Nice shower 
193211,Novotel London Blackfriars, Unfortunate that the swimming pool screen was only half working Nothing else to fault great hotel great stay , Staff great very welcoming Really enjoyed our stay Gym and spa facilities great Room clean smart and modern 
193212,Novotel London Blackfriars, The room service for 24 7 wasn t too great I didn t realise that only a few items would actually be available The English breakfast was not good at all We ended up not feeling to well after The gas brown was very oily and the scrambled eggs were really bland I was also served cold coffee , We really liked the cleanliness level of the room The swimming area and changing area was very nice
193213,Novotel London Blackfriars, I was very disappointed that there was no where to plug a hairdryer in near to a mirror For this reason I may not stay again , This hotel is convenient for me It is clean and modern The staff are always pleasant and helpful 
193214,Novotel London Blackfriars, Lack of drop off point and unsure whether could park near hotel for a limited time free of charge to drop off bags No car parking within 15 min walk , Good location with friendly help fun staff Room well furnished and pool was great
193215,Novotel London Blackfriars, We enjoyed our stay so no issues maybe hot chocolate sachets in rooms with children could be good , Cool bathroom screen created great excitement for my 13 year old son who loved surprising his 22 year old brother with daft antics throughout our stay Brilliant 
193216,Novotel London Blackfriars, Our 3rd bed had not been made up or extra towels etc provided We checked in at 8pm Room was booked for 3 people Otherwise No issues had a good stay ,No Positive
193217,Novotel London Blackfriars,No Negative, the cleaners were poor they knocked too early and once we returned there was still food on the floor the recaption staff were ok the bar tender was excellent he loves making cocktails
193218,Novotel London Blackfriars, Really minor things there was no shower cap in the bathroom Missing spoon and tv cut out intermittently This wouldnt stop me from staying again , Staff were professional courteous bed was comfortable Great breakfast selection 
193219,Novotel London Blackfriars,No Negative, Whilst I have put good for location it really depends on where you are wanting to be For us it was ideal for train and things we wanted to do Others may prefer a more central location nearer the shops Staff and hotel were lovely and we would definitely go back
193220,Novotel London Blackfriars, No cream only milk for coffee but appears to be typical for this part of Europe LOL really no complaints , Room was a good size for the three of us mom dad and 15 yr old son lots of outlets and roomy bath Breakfast was plentiful and had something for everyone Decent coffee to boot More of a business area so quiet at night Not a bustling tourist area but easy to get all the sights Walk to Imperial War Museum which is amazing 
193221,Novotel London Blackfriars, The swimming pool was nice but water was too chilly to stay in for very long and that was the same for the jacuzzi which was a shame , Amazing breakfast never seen so much choice Shower was lovely and clean 
193222,Novotel London Blackfriars,No Negative, Very quiet room Bedroom and bathroom were nice spacious and clean Members of staff we talked to at reception were friendly and helpful Location was perfect for us 
193223,Novotel London Blackfriars, Hot tub wasn t hot and our coffee machine didn t work, Staff all lovely and welcoming The pillows were very comfy and the shower was very relaxing The view from our executive room was amazing 
193224,Novotel London Blackfriars, The beds were hard and uncomfortable and the towel station in the pool area wasn t always restocked, The room was clean and spacious and we enjoyed the pool and saunarium
193225,Novotel London Blackfriars, Although the rooms are designed well using the bathroom at night proves a little inconvenient if there is more than one person using the room the light in the bathroom shines through the glass wall of the shower onto the bed waking up your companion Also ordered a cheese and ham toasted sandwich from room service which turned out to be very plastic and tasteless , Lovely location so near tube stations and close to river Hotel is new so really clean and welcoming Swimming pool and pool area really lovely although a little crowded on Saturday afternoon The room was lovely very clean and the bed so comfortable Will definitely recommend and use again 
193226,Novotel London Blackfriars,No Negative, Staff helpful and polite great location for access to tube and London Southbank Room was good size with a lovely bed Everything was clean and the breakfast was very nice 
193227,Novotel London Blackfriars, Room was not ready for 3 occupants and although they sent someone up to make bed up straight away were not given Extra towel coffee cup and had to go and find one in the morning , Lovely room friendly staff
193228,Novotel London Blackfriars, No hot tub just cold bubbles and jets, Technology and room design cool glass feature in bathroom bedroom Gym and spa facilities were excellent Sound system in room Beds were comfortable 
193229,Novotel London Blackfriars, Novotel have shifted the toilets in this hotel into the bathroom area Why I like the way the old Novotel have the toilet furthest away from the bedroom and separate to the bathroom , Newish Novotel with great sauna and swimming pool in the basement A nifty location either a scenic walk across Blackfriars Bridge to the Circle Line or a nip down to Southwark Tube 100 yards away or a 7 minute walk to Waterloo 
193230,Novotel London Blackfriars, The mattress is old and so soft that it wasn t comfy at all we had to ask everyday for more shower gel and towels we expect more for an executive room at 300 pounds a night Also absolutely no organization for breakfast you have to queue for so long as there are free tables but the three staff there were wiping off tables carrying the cups one by one At this rythme we were not about to eat And this everyday as we stayed 6 days Also toilet paper feels cheap and not soft at all This is certainly not a 4 stars hotel , Location friendly staff the view of the Chard 
193231,Novotel London Blackfriars, bed too small for a couple not a good mattress can not use the toilets at night as there is a window between the bathroom and the room Long waiting to enter restaurant for breakfast, great location to visit London swimming pool very nice hotel staff very clean
193232,Novotel London Blackfriars, Waiting in line for breakfast with plenty of empty tables but they had not been cleared staff rushed off feet at busy time , Room was clean and good layout except no power socket near main large mirror for my wife to dry her hair WE FIND THIS IN MANY HOTELS SHE SAID A MAN must have designed the room Evening bar staff served great cocktails very happy chaps 
193233,Novotel London Blackfriars,No Negative, Great central location all the main attraction were Coke to walking distance Very Morden facilities and clean rooms with good esstinals Great quick and reliable service from staff whom all had smiles in their faces 
193234,Novotel London Blackfriars, Room was good but the size is not ideal for family room Unfortunately there s no upgrade for a bigger room , Good location husband enjoyed swimming pool and sauna
193235,Novotel London Blackfriars,No Negative, Great location and lovely spacious modern room Had a room on the first floor next to the busy road however heard absolutely no intrusive noise from inside or outside the hotel The room also had its own thermostat and air conditioning which I personally liked as find hotel rooms are always too hot 
193236,Novotel London Blackfriars, Really you have to get to breakfast early otherwise you have to wait for a while, We loved how clean and modern the hotel was and it was extremely quiet
193237,Novotel London Blackfriars, All good , Loved the spa and birthday cake they left in room for my daughter birthday Staff friendly great location and would defo stay there again 
193238,Novotel London Blackfriars, Room was nothing like the online pictures Scruffy bedding Burnt food from room service that was returned twice but I ended up with a refund and no food Rather obnoxious young man came to ask me what the problem was but a lovely young lady brought me a refund For the money spent it was very disappointing Had I been asked at check out did you enjoy your stay I would have said non but no one bothered asking , Central for meeting the following day 
193239,Novotel London Blackfriars, Breakfast was good but extremely busy at peak times which I felt put the staff under strain and meant little mistakes like no milk with our tea or coffee Very friendly staff so not really a problem, Nice hotel comfortable room Very good bathroom although the see through glass into the bedroom was a puzzle until we realised that you could make this opaque Roadworks outside but didn t interfere with our sleep 
193240,Novotel London Blackfriars, I didn t like the changes to the dining area made the facility dark and had a to me unpleasant cowboy feel, The pool is a great facility rooms are good but starting to feel a little tired Location is great for the Thames and near to tube
193241,Novotel London Blackfriars, Cost of breakfast 16 for a continental is a lot even by London standards There is a pret across the road where i went instead , I rarely leave reviews but this hotel really did impress me i stayed for 4 nights and also attended a course here and all facilities staff etc were excellent The hotel is minutes from Blackfiars and Southwark Tube Staff were very helpful and friendly
193242,Novotel London Blackfriars, Breakfast wasn t included in our stay even though it was expensive for 2 nights Loved the pool however the pool and the hot tub were both very cold And the cost of the bottles of water in the room were expensive , The hotel room was amazing and so was the view The hotel was really nice 
193243,Novotel London Blackfriars,No Negative, The location is great close to the tube station The room was very clean comfortable bed nice shower Great breakfast We stayed for 8 nights and loved it
193244,Novotel London Blackfriars, Could do with some seating in Reception area , Two minutes from Southwark tube station Spacious room with a view of The Shard Traffic noise was minimal with closed window 
193245,Novotel London Blackfriars, Absolutely not worth the money 255 for one night stay There were stains on the chairs in the room Not what you expect at that cost per night Very basic for the very high price , Got upgraded to balcony room
193246,Novotel London Blackfriars, Road works outside is a bit of an inconvenience Has to be done though , Typical Novotel in a great location 20 mins from Covent Garden and the same time from Borough Market 
193247,Novotel London Blackfriars, Bed was very uncomfortable needed new mattress 40 minute wait for breakfast as staff didn t have a clue how to be organised over half the tables covered in plates very poor , Pool facility was good and shower in room
193248,Novotel London Blackfriars, The only thing I would say I didn t like was the swimming pool was cold the location was good but I think for a young couple I would have liked to have stayed the other side of the thames, Lovely clean friendly hotel the breakfast was beautiful with a great variety done in a buffet style
193249,Novotel London Blackfriars, Jamboree breakfast room restaurant very casual and style not in keeping with rest of hotel No toilets on ground floor near reception area restaurant bar , Nice clean and spacious room
193250,Novotel London Blackfriars, Was very expensive but have to expect it in london , I liked the room and the shower was amazing Good view of the shard from window Great location just a minute walk from southwark jubilee line Really nice pool too 
193251,Novotel London Blackfriars, The hotel was undertaking a renovation in the bar and restaurant We were asked to move three times during our lunch so that the builders could do their work I wouldn t have minded that but my lunch a sandwich was poor and made with cheap white bread The place smelt of paint Then the staff had a staff meeting and I got the whole training experience I asked to move to a quieter spot as my colleague and I had a meeting to prepare for We were told in no uncertain terms that it wasn t possible I did complain about all the disruption and again the bar man didn t really seem to care The service was slow and all of them looked like they didnt want to be there I also complained on check out and there was no real apology The staff overall weren t the friendliest and I would definitely stay elsewhere next time, The room was lovely and the bed was really comfortable 
193252,Novotel London Blackfriars, I only have two issues that are v picky The wall that separates the bathroom from the bedroom is a glass wall that you click a button to tint which is uber cool but if anyone needs to use the bathroom in the middle of the night the light illuminates the entire bedroom The other problem was that the pool was freezing with a capital F Like I said picky but worth knowing It wouldn t stop me from booking again , Lovely clean modern hotel great location with very friendly and helpful staff They were great with the kids We had a family room two adults and 2 children under 10 the room was spacious and the children s beds were comfortable even though they were put me ups We also ate in the restaurant one evening and the food was very good 
193253,Novotel London Blackfriars, We were put in a disabled room without being informed There was nowhere to put even a glass on the bedside table as the phone took up the tiny space I think that this room was uncomfortable as the minimalist style was carried to the extreme Breakfast was expensive ,No Positive
193254,Novotel London Blackfriars, Taxi firm used was much more expensive than the black cab our return to Paddington was a lot more than the black cab charged for the same distance , Rooms were more or less soundproofed from other internal rooms and corridors food excellent although the menu could be more varied every day choice limited Star of the staff was Sophie whose genuine friendliness helpfullness surpassed all other staff could be the face of Novotel as in our opinion she was representative of all employees of Novotel not including Leon France thank you Sophie so much 
193255,Novotel London Blackfriars, refurbish that was happened in the hotel cause some minor problems It is expensive for the, The location of the horel was convinient and the breakfast was very good
193256,Novotel London Blackfriars,No Negative, Would not stay at this hotel again The breakfast was awful Taste like cardboard There is also security at night who questions you at the entrance of the hotel You feel like a villain which I did not appreciate Not your typical hotel More like a Travelodge In fact Travelodge is a lot better
193257,Novotel London Blackfriars, first room allocated at the back of the hotel had 1 window of approx 1m x 1m girl said nice and quite p after complaining I was relocated to the front and that was a perfect room and due to double glasing no noise at all , location is very close to the underground all rooms are new inside
193258,Novotel London Blackfriars, we were told we would receive a travel pkg of info at check in and we did not But in the morning another staff member gave us some brochures maps after asking about a specific address dining memu was too limited the pool was not heated we were hoping there would be a hot tub , the rooms were clean and fresh on a daily basis Breakfast was good but no variety on the daily buffet 
193259,Novotel London Blackfriars, Ask to check out late and they wanted 80 Not very helpful Some reception staff difficult to understand as don t speak good English , Breakfast was really good Clean and comfortable room
193260,Novotel London Blackfriars, Unfortunately I didn t receive the butter I ordered for my breakfast however I m more than sure if I hadn t let my own personal anxiety to pick up the phone get in the way the staff there would have been more than happy to supply me my bad If I was to be harsh a couple of things would be to have different furniture in the room for those who want to take in the view from windows if you have a room with a view that is and a TV guide for the rooms TV might have had one but I couldn t find it however I did get a TV guide on my iPad using the hotels super fast wifi so no biggie , The staff were extremely pleasant friendly warm happy helpful and professional View from my room was a great insight into London day by day with an amazing view of the shard Room and hotel was extremely clean and tidy All my room facilities work perfectly and the bed was lush and room was void of external sounds This is the second time I ve stayed here and new it was a good idea to go back next time I m back in London this is where I will be staying again 
193261,Novotel London Blackfriars,No Negative, We enjoyed the glass wall of the bathroom but we had to discover how it works May be a note on the button regulating the transparency of the glass could help mature people as we are 
193262,Novotel London Blackfriars, Line for breakfast was unfortunate Some wifi probs Staff unfamiliar with local pubs and retaurants, Staff was amazingly nice and attentive Room was comfy and clean Pool really nice after touring Location was top notch
193263,Novotel London Blackfriars, Due to busy period July rather long wait to be seated for breakfast Breakfast itself was excellent though , Excellent hotel more business style but very stylish Ideally located in center of London walking distance from both underground as trains Decent coffee and excellent breakfast
