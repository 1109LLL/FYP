189904,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, The shower could have been simpler in terms of design and confort , The hotel is clean nicely decorated and comfortable The neighborhood is good and there are good restaurants and shops close by This hotel is good value for money at least during weekends 
189905,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Perhaps that it s difficult to get things to eat after midnight but I m somewhat greedy lol, Great atmosphere great location surrounded by landmarks and places to eat cant go wrong 
189906,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, It would be nice if we can opt for late checkout around 5pm Also if you can provide electric kettle for each room it would be nice, The ambience is good I like the staff and the room eventhough it s quite small Wish I could stay longer 
189907,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Bathrooms could have been cleaner No complimentary daily water bottles nor coffee and tea , Excellent breakfast Excellent location Very kind and helpful staff 
189908,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, This time there was a trainee at the reception which gave me the key for the wrong room Also she was not very helpful giving recommendations directions, I like this hotel I have stayed here number of times It is clean quiet you can have a good night sleep very conveniently located
189909,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, I had an item stolen from me Brought it up with management They did get me stills from the camera which showed that I had with me on the day of leaving They did not handle the matter to my satisfaction They have promised to make my next stay better that s if I go back ,No Positive
189910,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, The spa was meant basically for 2 people even though is open for everybody but that s its maximum capacity so you have to wait if there s someone else using it The water of the jacuzzi was cold and it couldn t be adjusted so we basically used the turkish bath which was quite good there was no sauna So if you go only for the spa beware that it s really small and not at its best , The bed was incredibly comfortable with a really comfy bed and a nice balcon The bathroom was a little bit small for two people but you could still manage The breakfast was really good and varied 
189911,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, I don t know why but air conditioning was on and the room was freezing I turned off every time I was out but again it was on when I was back The temperature outside was not so high it was like 20degree So it was quite odd , The staff was very nice and helpful My colleague has arrived AM10 00 and he has been trying to get him checked in the room as soon as possible Since she has arrived after long flight it was really appreciated 
189912,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, View from the room It looked into a wall as the hotel built in a square design , Breakfast was awesome Full French breakfast Fresh juice meats breads 
189913,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa,No Negative, Beautiful stay Staff were so friendly and helpful The bed extra comfy The bathroom and all spa facilities were amazing The area was buzzy and just a short walk to the metro 
189914,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, The breakfast is to expensive I would rather recommend that you go out and find a french bistro and have breakfast there instead , Really nice hotel with service minded and welcoming staff We had a nice room on 1st floor great beds and pillows The spa area is small but still nice and quite The hotel is clean and the area feels safe Five minutes walk to the subway and almost 2 km to walk to the Eiffel Tower A really nice walk which I can recommend 
189915,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Service could be better , A hotel is located in the centre of Paris A room and a bathroom are clean Bed in the double room consists of two parts Staff in the hotel is absolutely impolite and imposing The receptionist didn t let our guests to come to us A man came to my room to check mini bar in spite I was in a bed and there was a plate not disturb on the door Our staying could be good if personnel hadn t behave like personnel in the soviet dormitory 
189916,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, this time I found small problems here and there The Hairdryer was not functioning the cleaning of the floor was not done properly for two days the bathroon needs a bit of refurbishment the doors have scratches they do need maintenance , location hall personnel very kind and helpful 99 of them overall I continue to like the place 
189917,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa,No Negative, The location here was awesome 30 mins walk to the Louvre and cheap taxi s to other locations The staff was fantastic and the room was quiet and comfortable I would stay here again for a Paris visit 
189918,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Wi fi was a bit patchy , Beautiful boutique hotel with lovely furnishings in the rooms Very comfortable and staff were so friendly Breakfast was a good selection
189919,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa,No Negative, The help given to me after a late arrival I was recommended a good restaurant open late at night and I was handed a printed map with directions Excellent service 
189920,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Only minor gripe I had was that the kettle wasn t cleaned properly A previous guest must have used it to cook noodles in it or something as there were leftover noodles inside it , located in a central area and close by to the gare du nord station it was overall a very comfortable stay and the breakfast was lovely 
189921,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, The heating was very poor and the suite was cold The staff were helpful but the problem needs fixing, The staff are great the rooms well decorated the location excellent
189922,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, The manager who did the check in was sadly very Parisian I have spoke fluent French for many years When working at Galeries Lafayette I was considered Bilingual The manager however told me that my French ability might just be good enough to manage the wifi registration system If I was lucky A little unnecessary and condescending , Room service is always great The decoration is fabulous 
189923,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, No hot drink facilities in the room and the main shower attachment in the bathroom dribbled with water going on the floor , The staff were extremely helpful the beds were comfy the decor was lovely and the room was quiet The spa facilities were nice though tiny and the therapist skilled 
189924,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Would have liked a drawer somewhere in the room Had to hang our undies in a carrier bag in the wardrobe and all other bits in the safe Thought breakfast rather expensive but found good cafes very close by , Very comfortable bed great location for getting around 
189925,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa,No Negative, Supremely comfortable hotel with many original design features and a whole series of atmospheric sitting rooms Shelves of books to read including more than 100 in the glorious suite into which I was upgraded 
189926,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, I had a drink one night and ordered G T I believe that the waitress forgot the G Not the right place for drinks , Still my favourite place in town when the price is right Perfect location for shopping in the Printemps or Galeries Lafayette shopping mall or walk around Madeleine Opera and even Louvres Champs Elysees
189927,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa,No Negative, Great location in local shopping district which suited us as we don t like the touristed St Germain area to stay in We loved the extra space of the rooms too which is rare for Paris 
189928,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Rooms are small Ideal for no more than 2 ppl Having a baby in the room makes it quite tight for space , Location is only a 10 15 min walk away from champs elysees and many other major tourist attractions The hotel is tucked away in a quiet street The customer service is exceptional from all staff at this hotel
189929,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Expensive breakfast although most things in Paris are , Great stylish comfy and clean hotel with friendly staff and a great location to get to all the sights restaurants and bars 
189930,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa,No Negative, The staff were all very happy and welcoming It was close to 3 metro lines Very close to printemps and Valerie Lafayette The neighbourhood had lots of great bars and restaurants The hotel was spotless and really comfortable 
189931,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa,No Negative, I only stayed here one night but the comfort level of the room was fantastic the staff was friendly and helpful and the lounge area was tranquil and useful The location is convenient to Gare St Lazare
189932,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa,No Negative, Stayed here for the Euros One stop from Gare du Nord on new E line Close to st Augustine and st Lazard Walking distance of all the sights and shops Great restaurants close by Staff were very welcoming and helpful 
189933,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, bathroom facilities outdated room next to busy road with sound coming through which was not conducive for great night s sleep Advice take courtyard room instead , Friendly staff good location
189934,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, I had to leave , very polite and friendly staff top quality hotel service great attention to details I thought the Albin Michel collection was a very nice touch also the location was excellent and the room was very quiet even as it was on the side street
189935,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, The spa experience, The Hotel was great Breakfast was excellent staff very pleasant Unfortunately we had a bad experience at the day spa My husband arrived on Friday 13 th around 2pm and booked the extra night He asked to book a massage for both myself and him for the Sunday at 3pm The staff said there was no problem with that The next day they cancelled the massage apparently they over booked so my husband asked if we could still use the facilities steam juccuzi and was told that would be fine We arrived at 3pm no one to greet and the Spa door was locked We knocked but no answer We waited and around 20 mins later knocked again Around 3 30pm a very upset massage women stormed out screaming at us in French stating we were banging on the door and she was going to call the police Very disturbing as we were only wanting to relax I think that if the Spa isn t part of the Hotel It should be made clear and perhaps booking should be sorted out through them only Anyway We still had a wonderful time in Paris as coming from Australia is a long way We would hesitate to stay with you again But would investigate another Spa experience Regards Liane Lancaster
189936,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Room smelt like smoke service a bit lacklustre bathroom had some damp Real shame as have stayed here several times before but gone downhill, Good size room for Paris location near opera and centre of the city
189937,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, The Hotel remains however at a high range of price for services which should be quite standard , The Bed was comfy and the breakfast was very good for French standards 
189938,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Rooms are a little small Spa cannot be used if someone has booked a massage everything else is very good, Hotel and rooms are very beautifully decorated Hotel is within minutes walk to St Lazare station Bed was comfortable Staff friendly They organise a beautiful bunch of flowers for my wife s birthday 
189939,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, The men on reception were great but the girls paled in comparison , If you are single the girls try to putt you in the smallest room but the larger room that they keep for couples is the same price 
189940,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, When I arrived the room temperature was 18 degrees and even after putting the heating on it never went above 19 It was somewhat chilly , In general it is a nice hotel and I had a quiet room 
189941,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa,No Negative, Great Rooms with a nice bathroom Room was pretty big for usual conditions in Paris very nice Style clean good breakfast perfect location short to bus tours stations and metro shopping streets many little restaurants and pubs around 
189942,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, There are times where there s no one at the reception It was a little annoying when checking in as no one was there for a good five minutes , Staff were nice 
189943,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, The TV cable doesn t work very signals quite poor, The accessibility to key attractions and retail The quiet lounge space is conducive for informal mtgs
189944,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Room service if you really have to is very disappointing And no gym facilities, Great location easy no fuss service Great rooms which feel like suites
189945,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Hotel was worth the money but any extras are expensive One of the hotel maids knocked the door every evening to ask something She didn t speak a word of English and let herself in if you didn t answer the door , Clean modern and quiet Plenty of storage room Excellent facilities apart from no English tv channels Excellent location as it was away from the busy main streets but close enough to walk Surrounded by a number of metro s to take you all over Paris Helpful friendly staff always there to offer help if needed 
189946,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Being woken up at 1 00am by a plumber in the next room And this was a piece of planned work I would still recommend the hotel despite this minor blip , Room 64 6th floor at front small accessible balconies with limited roof top views towards Eglise St Augustin and Louis XVI Square
189947,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Couple of things I think could be improved 1 Having to continuously reconnect to the Internet wifi 2 More frequent refilling in the breakfast room particularly hot food , Great location helpful staff and good sized room 
189948,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Room is small wardrope colors are gray Toilet is separate from washing room which I dislike , Style is classical which makes it nice lobby is cozy breakfast is generous street is calm 
189949,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, No shower curtain all walter splashed on the floor during shower no kettle have never experienced a hotel doesn t have kettle the hair dryer is sucks always shuts down after 2min ,No Positive
189950,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Expensive single room small and can hardly move around the room and small closets , The breakfast was very good close to two metros good staff and clean 
189951,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, the breakfast area was almost empty of guests although the hostess seemed too busy to wecome was not smiling surprising in a 4 , Comfort location easy access room decoration A really nice place where to stay to get a taste of Paris The receptionist was kind and very welcoming 
189952,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Getting a very small charge to my card for no reason Free water the first night only the price per night remains the same if I am 1 person x 5 night in a row or 5 people x 1 night so thought that was a bit cheap of them Nespresso machine with no milk , Staff are always pleasant good housekeeping Close to main attractions with a walk but also close to Metro stations Great bathroom
189953,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Pricey but was a busy week end in Paris Small room despite not being the lowest category , Very convenient location yet quiet Note connecting rooms are available for families 
189954,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, The street noise and beware there are numerous bars adjacent the hotel Also there are no irons in the room ask for one at the reception if you choose to stay here , Le Mathurin maybe a great location to base an extended holiday in Paris with dozens of bars and restaurants within a few minutes walk but for business the streets outside are relentlessly noisy Lots of mopeds motorbikes and street chatter to keep you occupied through the night The hotel is however conveniently located next door to the financial services district and deserves a mention for its cleanliness comfortable beds and general decor 
189955,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Chambre individuelle was rather compact but that s often the case in Paris , Well presented and comfortable Hotel in an excellent location with particularly friendly and obliging staff throughout 
189956,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Night porter did not answer door for considerable time then no apology Us and another couple both tried ringing the telephone number and the door bell for around 30 minutes Price high for a room so small zero facilities no gym paper thin walls no parking , Location decor and cleanliness Pub next door serves real beer 
189957,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, It was irritating not to be able to use the sauna because someone else was having a massage in the Spa area as I booked specifically to be able to use this facility , Lovely hotel perfectly located
189958,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa,No Negative, The hotel is a boutique hotel about 3 blocks from Gare St Lazare and very close to The Madeleine and the Opera house The staff at the hotel is very friendly and the hotel is lovely with well appointed rooms Very very nice 
189959,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa,No Negative, The front desk staff was amazing so helpful and friendly Even though the room was small the decor was luxurious so it felt very comfortable Centrally location and very quiet 
189960,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, no information or ticket for reduction of parking costs no electricity on the bathroom was not working on 230V we had to pay for 1 telephone concerning the reservation for a taxi no information of the neighborhood we need to ask everything by ourself,No Positive
189961,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, This isn t really a family hotel The hotel says it has parking but it s a public car park 5mins away not on site and was expensive 40 for 1 night for the price I d have expected breakfast to be included it wasn t and for a family of 5 it was nearly a 100 Wifi cut off at midnight so no access in the morning when check out wasn t till 12 , Location style and comfort of hotel Best suited for couples 
189962,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, We requested early check in as my girlfriend was ill Upon arrival the room was not ready The lady at our check in was very cold and did not show any anticipation on the situation I requested a call to my mobile when the room would be available That call never came My girlfriend stayed at the lobby and when she after a few hourse checked if the room was available suddenly it was But nobody made the effort to call me or inform her Also room cleaning was badly We did not receive water in the room during our 3 day stay I remember you get a new bottle once a day 3Th day the room was only half cleaned and meft like that with the trash still in the room some things on the floor This is very different from my normal experience in this hotel and most likely I will not return as there are other alternatives in the area in the same quality price range where we did never experience this , I am regular guest in this hotel Breakfast was super as always Also the coffee machine in the room is highly apreiated 
189963,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, Every time you leave hotel and come back you have to enter log in password for wifi, Location is great most of attractions are reachable by quick walk lots of nice places to eat around the hotel The rooms are clean a bit small but bathroom area big enough comparing to my previous experience in Paris Overall good hotel 
189964,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, The breakfast was 27 Euros , The staff were fabulous really helpful and accomodating I booked at about 10 30pm after an awful airbnb experience and they got back to me the same night and let me drop my bags off at 8 30am They apologised for the lack of balcony despite my late booking The room was big enough for me great bathroom and separate lavatory big windows and dark curtains for a good night s sleep air conditioning very central and close to Metro and a nice breakfast cafe Nice facilities downstairs to sit and read and relax 
189965,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, It s a minor concern but I found the shower hard to work out I may be the only one though , Staff were helpful room was pleasantly decorated and felt safe for a solo traveller 
189966,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, No complaints really room was very comfortable AC worked well wifi was reliable but you do need to continually sign in , Loved the location 10 minute walk from Concorde and Champs lys es Very well kept nicely nicely decorated boutique hotel Very cosy and confortable Ideal for city break long weekend would recommend 
189967,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, There is nothing I did not like, Great hotel for Paris for sure Everything was clean and nice Staff was friendly and helpful Hotel is close to bars and restaurants so after long day of exploring Paris you don t have to go far for a dinner or a drink 
189968,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa,No Negative, Fashionable design Very comfortable bed Helpful staff Rich assortment at breakfast Great location easy access to metro stations restaurants shops 
189969,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa,No Negative, Perfect location and service very clean and quiet Appreciated the help to take the picture for my ticket of ship when I left at room but no time to catch up 
189970,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa, The staff definitely needs more training to work in a 4 star hotel They don t really appreciate the essence of customer service Example 1 we were in a rush in the morning and cannot have a sit down breakfast I asked for something to takeaway the staff at first told me they can t do it breakfast can only be eaten in the hotel I spent another minute persuading her we just needed something simple like a sandwich and that we really don t have the time to sit down Eventually we convinced her to make us the sandwiches but the relationship is gone Example 2 the check in service was more complicated than it needs to be We were told that we MUST present the credit card used during booking otherwise they can t check us in That strict rule was not mentioned before arrival Eventually we found the credit card but we really didn t need this stressful experience on arrival If this was such a critical rule then it should be noted before arrival so that we are aware of it , The room with the outdoor jacuzzi is pretty unique for Paris Very nicely decorated hotel Spa service offerings 
189971,Le Mathurin Hotel Spa,No Negative, Excellent hotel very convenient and highly recommended
