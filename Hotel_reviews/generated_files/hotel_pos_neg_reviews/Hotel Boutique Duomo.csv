481338,Hotel Boutique Duomo, the hotel is absolutely not at the standards of a 4 The receptionnist was not competent even if he was trying to help We had booked a family room and they gave us 2 double rooms he said they did not have any but actually it appears they were not usable We tried to change for a triple which would have allowed us to stay together but they gave a room that was already occupied imagine the face of the woman when we entered her room In each room there is a fridge for champagne just next to the bed which is terribly noisy and honestly quite useless I would not recommend this hotel , nothing
481339,Hotel Boutique Duomo,No Negative, Very good breakfast Excellent and very helpful personnel As a family of 4 we got 2 rooms which had a common entrance which then lead to the two rooms doors which was very convenient Access to the center of town was very convenient as there is a tram stop right outside the hotel that takes you right at the Domus square There were facilities in the area including a Pizza restaurant and a supermarket 
481340,Hotel Boutique Duomo,No Negative, My room wasn t ready so I ve been given the suite Very nice room although the floor was quite dusty and dirty Noone at the breakfast room so I couldn t have any espresso
481341,Hotel Boutique Duomo, there was no thing i didn t like i had nice time in Hotel Boutique Duomo , in Hotel Boutique Duomo i met nice kind receptionists and stuff Clean and calm place Safe area Walk distance from hotel is metro and fast connection to every corner of city Open market 5 min from hotel 
481342,Hotel Boutique Duomo, Our air conditioner didn t work We asked the staff to look at it and he suggested we sleep with the door open which we obviously didn t do We asked if he had a fan but he didnr come back to the room after he left We slept with the room at 28 degrees It was also very loud both outside and inside Beware if you want to get a good night sleep It s very far to the city center , Big clean rooms Very clean and newly renovated Price was right 
481343,Hotel Boutique Duomo, I am very disappointed with my stay at Hotel Boutique Duomo They did not have wifi but that is what I payed for , The room looks great Also the breakfast is ok 
481344,Hotel Boutique Duomo, Wi Fi was not available during all our stay The rooms facing the road have no noise cancellation windows It felt like we were staying outside And had to change the room Parking is too expensive on site is not so easy to find , The hotel is newly renovated the rooms are designed in the modern style in light colours The toilettres are available in the shower what is very comfortable Location is good tram station are just next to the hotel which are link to the center A lot of restaurants are on site Metro station is not far away 
481345,Hotel Boutique Duomo, Location quite far from the metro station and not really central Very noisy road outside the window so can t open it at night and permanent light in transparent mini bar that you can t switch off so needs to be covered with some sort of blanket at night, Breakfast was very good and the room was big
481346,Hotel Boutique Duomo,No Negative, Excellent position because you can find free parking and in front of hotel is bus stop and 5 min walk tram or metro New renovated with few small mistakes recommendation 
481347,Hotel Boutique Duomo, the beds were two single bed stuck together Water in bath would not go down easily problems with small things like battery for safety box remote controls lack of hangers for cloths Air conditions was not working well in the booking mentioned that the camera has a refrigerator but it has not ,No Positive
481348,Hotel Boutique Duomo, Rude staff Unaccommidating staff Staff had no knowledge about local buses or any info on getting excursions Had paid for breakfast but charged me for tea coffee Bad location to city Far away not easy to access city , Nothing
481349,Hotel Boutique Duomo, the parking option is quite expensive 25 EUR day although we were lucky and found a place in front of the hotel free for charge simply because we arrived late on Saturday afternoon and left Sunday morning , location is very good close to Garibaldi square even at walking distance about 30 min where there are lots of shops bars and restaurants the bus stop is in front the hotel and the Metro station is not far away the room equipment furniture was very interesting and especially the hot tub in the room with the fridge loaded with Sparking wine very romantic the breakfast was good quality and had good choices of food the Reception Desk staff was very friendly and helpful
481350,Hotel Boutique Duomo, Maybe the Cleanness should be better as when I came the floor wasn t so clean , Breakfast was good service as well free Wifi and location of the hotel 
481351,Hotel Boutique Duomo, Room was dirty Maybe had been cleaned but hair all over floor towels thrown on chair rubbish in bin in bathroom Mini bar was open and someone had helped themself to chocolate Actual room door was open when i arrived to the hotel , Staff were friendly and helpful 
481352,Hotel Boutique Duomo,No Negative, Clean spacious and reasonably handy for town Staff were efficient and courteous Only champagne and wine in mini bar but didn t visit to drink in hotel so not a problem Modern coffee machine was nice A pleasant stay overall for one night in Milan 
481353,Hotel Boutique Duomo, N A, The staff were friendly very helpful and made my stay memorable for my birthday immaculately clean well located couldn t fault would definitely recommend them 
481354,Hotel Boutique Duomo, In my arrival there was a very rude receptionist so my first impression about this hotel was extremely bad that bad that I was thinking to lose my money I had already paid for my stay and search for another hotel I always travel with my cat only to hotels that pets are allowed I also inform the hotels at the time of booking that I will have a pet with me just I case there is a problem or extra charge I made a special request in booking com for an earlier check in the check in is at 14 00 because of my cat This receptionist had a really rude tone speaking to me loudly that this is a hotel for human not animals That I had the leave the hotel coming back at 14 00 and at this time he would call his boss to see if I can have my cat He also mentioned that durian my 3 days stay the cat should only stay inside that transport carriage When I arrived back at 14 00 he didn t say anything about the cat I politely asked him that the cleaning personnel do not enter my room on the next day so that the cat is safe Then he gave me the key of the room 106 Surprise the room 106 has a problem and the door never locks Later on I was informed that this problem is known to the reception for more than a month time and they do not use this room Anyway the story had a happy end the next receptionist changed my room apologized about his colleague and was extremely helpful during my 3 days of stay So Migara THANK YOU for everything It is really a pity that the image of such a pretty hotel can be so easily destroyed by a bad receptionist , This hotel is fully renovated the rooms are spacious and the Wi Fi is really strong Every room has more than everything you need and you have an espresso machine a small fridge in every room The M5 metro station Cenisio is reachable in 7 8 minutes walking Outside the hotel there is a bus and a tram stop no12 that takes you to the center An absolutely super hotel in a super price 
481355,Hotel Boutique Duomo, It wasn t possible to lock the room The staff told us it s ok don t worry The heating in our room was broken didn t work It was pretty cold in February The TV also didn t work Cleaning service wasn t very good as well ,No Positive
481356,Hotel Boutique Duomo, Nothing at all as the place wasn t clean , The hotel is totally different from what we see on the pictures and doesn t qualify to be graded as a 4 star hotel staff is unfriendly as a first timer in Milan I was extremely disappointed and as for the price I feel ripped off 
481357,Hotel Boutique Duomo, The water pressure from the shower was poor when other people have showered at the same time This was the only weak point of the booking , The staff was very friendly and they tried to help you in any manner The furniture and decorations are new and this is nice 
481358,Hotel Boutique Duomo, A little bit noisy because of the traffic in the street, Location is good if you are a good walker 3 km to the main sights is a not a problem The bus stop to the airport is a 15 minute walk straight along the next street The staff is helpful and nice The room is comfortable spacious enough
481359,Hotel Boutique Duomo, There is a lot that we didn t like during our stay Everything began upon check in when instead of a Deluxe King Room we were placed in a room for disabled persons When we came back to complain we were told by a arrogant receptionist that hotel is fully booked and that there is no other room for us After discussing for more then 10 minutes we decided to check on the site of booking com are there any rooms available at the property on our dates and as we thought there were plenty of rooms available at their hotel Finally after showing that to the employee they agreed to change us the room but we had to wait until they clean it We weren t also satisfied with the cleaning service cause in my opinion the floor in the room hasn t been cleaned for 4 days And if you wanted to take a shower you had to do it quickly because after 5 min you would ran out of hot water So definitely a hotel I would not come back under any circumstances , Unfortunately there is nothing to add in this field 
481360,Hotel Boutique Duomo, Metal blinds in the room didn t work and after complaining twice we still didn t get anybody in the room to fix it Because of that we had no daylight during our stay There was no closet and no garbage bin in the room , Reception always available and friendly and polite staff Coffee machine in the room with capsules Very modern furniture and nicely arranged room Breakfast was good 
481361,Hotel Boutique Duomo, So we booked a room for two people and it was told that it is air conditioned it has balcony bathroom that has both shower and bath We paid arround 65 euro including travelers fee for 1 night But when we came into the room there was no balcony no bath only shower and the room temperature was only 16 degrees because air conditioning was not working properly only in the morning it reached 18 degrees but that is still cold administrator tried to set the temperature to maximum but that did not worked Also the toilet was clogged and we could not flush the water shower and sink had the same problem water flowed through the edges In the morning we asked for refund but we have not received one , Tv wifi 
481362,Hotel Boutique Duomo, Unfortunately there are still snags which need to be fixed up like the heating too cold or too hot and the water in the shower never hot , The hotel is being renovated so everything is new 
481363,Hotel Boutique Duomo, The room was poor and the room s details were not for a four stars hotel at all The door did not close well the TV did not work the bathroom did not have curtains and the finishings were not curated , I asked to be moved to another room because the first one did not satisfied the expectations I had when I booked the room After insisting a bit they changed my room with a Deluxe which was very nice 
481364,Hotel Boutique Duomo, A minor thing the room was really warm when I arrived , Breakfast was wonderful Fernando was very courteous even at 8am on Christmas morning The tram stop right outside the hotel made for a convenient trip to city center

481366,Hotel Boutique Duomo, All lovely could Have used more ice in the bar and another waste bin but menial stuff, The bathtub in the room was an indulgence the shower was fantastic all in all very spacious and lovely
481367,Hotel Boutique Duomo, Minibar next to the Bed to noisy at night I spoke to the Manager I m positive they will fix it They don t have Parking space , Very modern style 10 min to the metro station Rooms are very clean Very good price for Milano
481368,Hotel Boutique Duomo, The facilities and services they offered when you booked was totally inaccurate They didn t offer a laundry or dry cleaning service like stated the didn t offer bike rental like stated instead they referred you to where you could hire bikes There was no explanation of the breakfast they served the next day and they couldn t really offer any tourist information to you Although the rooms are clean and modern we were shocked that there was no curtain in the bathroom so the apartment block next door could see directly in while you where on the toilet or in the shower And as for the shower the water cuts in and out it would turn off for 5 6mins then you d have to wait till it come back on When we complained about that we didn t get the response of 4star hotel nothing was done at all And the wifi was not reliable at all kept cutting in and out , It was in a good location and walking distance to most places and the tram line stopped right out the front 
481369,Hotel Boutique Duomo, Poor shower facility due to the lack of water flow , Spacious room excellent staff who remember your name and rooms are cleaned to perfection everyday 
481370,Hotel Boutique Duomo, The bathroom was a wet room and the shower had no hook to hold it up high The room quickly filled with water which was a little annoying , The hotel is modern and stylish
