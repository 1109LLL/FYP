487365,TH Street Duomo, The check in seemed ad hoc and our room was not ready until four o clock They could not give any information on for example transportation not even a simple map of the city The room was threadbare design Nowhere to hang towels strange light shower drainage clogged and the door to the room wouldn t lock Thin worn out sheets and no madrass cover the bed sheet never stayed in place Breakfast not served until nine o clock and no one present after ten at night It felt like an unprofessional youth hostel without soul priced like a good hotel Choose another place to stay there are plenty ,No Positive
