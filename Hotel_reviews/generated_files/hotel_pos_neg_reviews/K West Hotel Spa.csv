429239,K West Hotel Spa, The fish cake from the room service menu made me Ill not only ruined my stay at the hotel but ruined my entire weekend i was sick all weekend and although the hotel said they would investigate what happened with the food they haven t got in touch with me Also I had to check out 3 hours late due to feeling so tired and throwing up all morning And I still was expected to pay for the late check out which I didn t mind so much but it just made the checking out process take even longer I wish I never booked Worst experience at a spa to leave sick stressed and upset Disgusted with management for no follow up call or email Before the bad room service food I was actually planning on returning again with a lot more prebooked treatments now I am just upset that one night which was meant to be something for me to destress had ruined my weekend off , Just so disappointed 
429240,K West Hotel Spa, The pillows one each ask for extra but very poor quality pillows And I thought the price of the valet parking was extortionate Especially as they brought the wrong car back up , Service good
429241,K West Hotel Spa, It would have been a perfect stay if the spa was open a bit later however we were offered half price on these facilities as we arrived at around 8pm, The rooms were very large and had its own kitchen Fantastic and comfy stay here will definitely stay again next time in London 
429242,K West Hotel Spa, The fact that I couldn t sleep The spa was over priced 20 to enter just spa It is advertised as k west hotel and spa if you stay you should be able to use the spa complimentary The hotel staff are in need of real robust training in customer handling and first aid Very appalled at the outcome of this situation , Fire alarms went off in 3 seperate occasions 6 45am 7am 7 15am Hotel staff walked into the room without knocking or alerting us while entering or entered No first aid qualified person on site as I had an incident and they could offer nothing and did nothing to help either Absolutely disgusted by management and staff for the way things were handled Hope they fix these issues The manager Allysia told me they couldn t offer any compensation due to the fire alarm waking me up at 6 45 am 3 times Absolutely pathetic 
429243,K West Hotel Spa, The breakfast was overpriced for what it was and the staff seemed keen to take our plates even though we hadn t finished The eggs were not cooked properly The bar staff seem very in experienced and I had to point out what vodka was , The staff were fantastic all friendly and professional The room was lovely and the air con worked well I loved the library room The door man was great 
429244,K West Hotel Spa, The first room wasn t ready on arrival but we had a complimentary drink at the bar with friendly bar service which made up for the short wait Access to TV movies music didn t work in the first room so we were given another room same size Would prefer to have pay for view movies for a set time and to be able to access several movies if I want in that time as opposed to paying for each movie individually and inserting credit card details in each time would rather pay with the bill at the end of my stay The second room had damp carpet near the bed they must have had it spot cleaned however it dried after a few hours , The hotel location is excellent minutes away from station Westfield shops movies and restaurants Staff are friendly helpful efficient We booked a room with a double bed but there were 2 single beds in the room we couldn t access the TV movies music so in the end we were given another room the same size with a bed that looked larger than a kingsize really nice Dj music was cool I requested a late checkout after midday GBP 10 each hour until 4pm its good to have a choice 
429245,K West Hotel Spa, Our room was not cleaned or made up in spite of being out from 0900 until 16700 which was very disappointing Stayed a number of times before but I doubt we will do it again ,No Positive
429246,K West Hotel Spa, The customer service wasn t what I had expected Having paid 30 for two breakfasts the quality of the food that we were served was poor and took an extremely long time Despite complaining several times it didn t seem to have an affect and I eventually received a refund as a result of our dissatisfaction , The Spa was excellently kept and perfect for couples who wish to stay here It s in a great location as you are two minutes within an underground station and therefore next door to Central London I would recommend this as a place for couples to go to as we certainly enjoyed our stay 
429247,K West Hotel Spa, Hotel had a lovely spa would have been nice if you could have use this without an additional charge , Great location close to underground Staff very helpful were upgraded to an executive room was very nice lovely super king bed robes and slippers in bathroom large tv and sofa in room breakfast was good and plenty to chose from would defiantly stay here again 
429248,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, Thr room and hotel decor was tired and a bit scruffy the room had a kitchen area no sink but the fridge didn t close and it clearly wasn t for use The bathroom was old fashioned byt clean and usable the bed was very comfortable windows in the room didn t open so as it was v hot we had to use the air con which was fine but the room did smell musty or perhaps a previous guest had smoked in the room Overall it was ok but we have stayed at other hotels in the area with similar facilities and felt more comfortable
429249,K West Hotel Spa, Smell on the 2nd floor , The food was excellent and the wait staff on 4th floor very friendly and helpful The bed was a little hard and the pillows were definitely hard There was a pretty bad smell on the 2nd floor were we stayed and that should be fixed 
429250,K West Hotel Spa, Room was surface clean ice bucket had pink mold bathroom drain didn t work but arrived too late back in evening to this discovery to have it sorted Room next door had a huge domestic 0400 friends had similar issue on nights earlier in the week Overall hotel staff are amazing however getting a full nights sleep shouldn t be on your priority list of things to have from this hotel Linens were also substandard for a 4 start hotel , Staff was friendly space to sit while sorting baggage after collection from bag storage was handy Near over underground as well as train station However keep in mind it s a fair journey into central London Stay more central if that s your focus of your journey 
429251,K West Hotel Spa, The rooms were a little noisy as you could hear doors slamming etc early in the morning down to inconsiderate guests as much as the hotels sound proofing We were disappointed to find our the spa facilities were at additional cost when you book at hotel with a spa you expect to be able to use them as part of the over all package, The staff were lovely and arranged rose petals on our bed and a small chocolate gift for our anniversary stay They also arranged for my husbands shirt to be ironed so we could make our lunch reservations even though we were too early to check in The staff were very friendly and helpful It is very handy for the central line tube stop and westfield shopping centre 
429252,K West Hotel Spa, 20 to use the pool this should be stated on the booking and not listed on hotel with pool Was the only complaint, Old fashioned service amazing hotel concierge was delightful Rooms all have USB ports it s funky welcoming rooms close to Underground and shopping
429253,K West Hotel Spa, This is NOT a Spa hotel it is falsely advertised The spa is at extra cost which although stated in the small print is not made clear until tounget there Plus the spa is tiny fits about 8 people in so you pay out for a very poor service indeed The interior is very dated in many places whatever the original hotel was it s still got a massive impact on the general feel and look of the hotel Couldn t get through to room service at all Sound system in the room didn t work You have to pay for all movies which in a hotel of this price should be inclusive Poor hotel generally, Good cocktails
429254,K West Hotel Spa, Wish we could have stayed longer, Having the use of the handy phone was a brilliant idea definitely made our travelling around the city so much easier
429255,K West Hotel Spa, The staff were very friendly and helpful but the room was terrible In the 6th last floor so it was extremely hot and the AC was not effective at all We had problems with some of the equipment n the room which was never resolved The location of the hotel is perfect near Westfield mall and underground station The hotel was extremely clean the gym was excellent I d definitely recommend it but check your room first , The staff were very friendly and helpful but the room was terrible In the 6th last floor so it was extremely hot and the AC was not effective at all We had problems with some of the equipment n the room which was never resolved The location of the hotel is perfect near Westfield mall and underground station The hotel was extremely clean the gym was excellent I d definitely recommend it but check your room first 
429256,K West Hotel Spa, Room was not ready in arrival hence upgrade Fast checkout was great to avoid queues but then had to go queue to pay for car parking , Upgraded to nicer room staff very pleasant very comfortable room large bed Good facilities
429257,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, The room was exactly what i was looking for I fell in love with the bed it was extremely comfy I would highly recommend and would definitely be staying again 
429258,K West Hotel Spa, The fire alarm went off at 3 30am and the entire building had to evacuate and then the same happened again later in the morning at around 9 30am The bathroom had a few mould stains around the bath, Lovely location and generally a nice hotel
429259,K West Hotel Spa, If I was being highly critical I would say the bathroom and some of the fixtures were a bit tired Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay , Lovely room we were lucky to be upgraded to a suite Leaving chocolate and fresh fruit in the room was a lvery nice touch 
429260,K West Hotel Spa, There was nothing I didn t like , The hotel was truly amazing although I little pricy to what I normally book it had reason to be Stunning hotel with excellent bar spa and restaurant facilities The room was exceptional with amazing little extras like a free travel buddy in every room for you to take out instead of using your own data I will most definitely stay here again You can literally walk to all the local bars pubs and restaurants just perfect 
429261,K West Hotel Spa, I was told there was parking available but we arrived on the day before a Shepherds Bush festival so the hotel car park was closed this meant getting across the renowned SB roundabout 15 mins 200 metres to the Metropolis called Westfield Parking unless you are a local this is a massive engagement just to figure out and park find your way up to the sunlight and back to the hotel then when you are ready to check out the same dilemma again finding the car is a starter so apart from the complete windup from the relaxed stay parking was an issue , Room very excellent all facilities practical and well thought out biggest asset the staff hotel felt comfortable and well managed apart from Parking
429262,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, I stayed here for 7 days and I absolutely loved it Nice modern hotel pleasant staff great breakfast and wonderful location with Westfield mall wich has everything in it bus overground underground stations in 5 min walk Kensington is a lovely area It was both great in the neighbouhood and easy to explore the rest of London The hotel also has complimentary gym and SPA for 20 GBP per day I will deffinetely try them next time Wow and I ve almost forgot there was a free smartphobe in the room to keep during the stay and take out with maps unlimited internet free local calls and many other It was awesome not to think about the internet when outside the hotel 
429263,K West Hotel Spa, Nothing already planned next stay, Bed was huge beautiful firm quality mattress The shower had different settings robe and slippers Restaurant and bar very clean I am going back here we ve stayed at hilton But here is exceptional Doorstep underground and Westfield shopping centre bonus Most friendly staff I ve met in hotels 10 10
429264,K West Hotel Spa, Next to the lift Noisy Expected service fee for two coffees only couple of pounds but really if I want to tip For coffee I will , Bar area and friendliness of staff Kept our bags for the day
429265,K West Hotel Spa, Corridors really long to our bedroom Not that can be helped lol , Rooms and bar atmosphere Food drink very nice Just an all round lovely hotel 
429266,K West Hotel Spa, Pretty disappointed from the moment I arrived from the waiting to get our key the comment from the receptionist the odd smell in the room The complimentary dressing gown was filthy Finally the entertainment system was pretty mediocre considering the heritage of the hotel reception did not know how to navigate to a music channel and we didn t manage to link to our spotify account , Bed was okay
429267,K West Hotel Spa, The front desk was clearly understaffed at times of check in and check out Due to the open bar close to the front desk there was a rather unpleasant smell when entering the Hotel , The room was well equipped comfortable and really quiet 
429268,K West Hotel Spa, Hi I wasn t impressed with the fire alarm going off at 3 30am in the morning it made me distressed it took me a while to go back asleep and then at 10 30am in the morning I was in the bath and had to jump out because of a fire alarm and had to stand in the cold with wet hair It made me tired all Saturday day time which made my day ruined as I couldn t do what I planned to do,No Positive
429269,K West Hotel Spa, I have stayed here many times previously but not for the last 3 and find it greatly different The carpets and decorations are very tired The food was less than indifferent although the staff are very pleasant Obviously has changed hands , Location
429270,K West Hotel Spa, The check in time could have been earlier so I get to enjoy the room more , I ve never met such friendly and lovely staff in my life And all so beautiful easily mesmerized in conversation 
429271,K West Hotel Spa, 1 Requested quiet room which turned out to be at the end of a very long corridor on top floor which was fine but WI fi was weak and we overlooked railway and minor road although not too noisy Not bad enough to request a room change but we ll know better next time we book which we will 2 Room service quick but ordinary bit expensive though but all are in London 3 Restaurant breakfast is expensive We always use Panini House from 0800 near stations for excellent breakfasts two eat at PH for less than one at KW , 1 Arrived early morning after all night flight Exceptional service from receptionist Alessia who arranged temporary room of same standard until our pre booked quiet room later that day was ready at no extra charge When we returned afternoon suitcases had already been moved to our booked room 2 Great reasonably quiet location within walking distance of Shepherd s Bush with easy underground overground rail and bus connections restaurants shops and Westfield Mall 3 Comfortable good sized rooms 4 Good reasonably fast connections to central London
429272,K West Hotel Spa, The room next to ours was having a party until the early hours We had to call reception to report it and it continued for a prolonged period This was due to the staff not coming straight away and because the occupants obviously did not listen to them , I like the location room and it proximity to shopping 
429273,K West Hotel Spa, The TV didn t work but apart from that it was good The price of the Spa on top of the hotel was v expensive 20 so we didn t use it Shame its not included for residents , Room was nice and big and the bathroom too Well equipped with the necessities required for a business stay 
429274,K West Hotel Spa, breakfast area not organised as well as it should of been food being stored on a tiers yoghurt should of been at the top and cereals at the bottom to make it easier to serve without dropping cereal into the yogurt before we even had started to eat breakfast we had a waiter ready to take the cutlery Eager or what , Easy location to shops quite area which was nice for any one wanting peace and quite 
429275,K West Hotel Spa, I cannot believe that you have to pay an additional fee to use the pool This really infuriated me when our room was so pricey that they would charge 20 extra just to use the chill area It was annoying because everything else was spot on and so I cannot say it s good value for money I wouldn t go again only for this reason there are plenty of spa hotels where the facilities are not an extra charge , The staff were wonderful they could not do enough The room was stunning with all mod cons couldn t get over the iPad in the room to order room service The hallways and welcome area were clean and tidy even though they are having a refurb All work men friendly and apologetic even though they did not need to be A four minute walk to the nearest tube with great connections to get us to the theatre 
429276,K West Hotel Spa, On arrival I was charged on my card and the money had come out my account and then when I checked out they said I hadn t paid so I showed my bank statement and they said that I had to pay again and the money that had been taken will be refunded So I had to pay twice for the hotel and then it was refunded into my account but a week later , The beds were very comfy the room came with a phone that you can use whilst staying at the hotel the phone could call international numbers free of charge the room was a nice space and the bathroom was nice The staff are very friendly and all say hello when you walk past them I would highly recommend to stay here 
429277,K West Hotel Spa, There was a slight sewage smell when we first arrived in the room But it had gone when we got back in the early hours The massive big deal was that the BBC Bargain Hunt green room was opposite our room From about 7 30am it was almost impossible to have a lay in which was what we would have wanted after a late one It may have been good to educate the people who use the meeting room facilities to be a bit mindful of their surroundings in the future I suppose in good ole hindsight we could have made a big deal of it at the time but we powered through until they left at about 10 00 , Room looked and was as described very roomy comfy and had very relaxing atmosphere which was surprising considering the location being perfect not far from the tube on the Central line 
429278,K West Hotel Spa, The constant stream of drunks and noisy people in the corridors at night I had a busy day on Saturday and it was not good to start it exhausted from lack of sleep It was a disgrace I thought it was a respectful spa hotel not some drunken party , The fox and its cub Room etc but no particular wow factor 
429279,K West Hotel Spa, Didn t like the fact that breakfast isn t included in price per night I think 125 00 is an extortionate price to charge for cancellation of a reservation less than 24hrs it should be nothing 30 04 17 was my first experience staying in K West for my birthday surprise I received Stale cake 2 balloons which didn t last a day a card shocking considered the prices charged per night , I liked the spa facilities I like the fact that they have a gym but didn t get the opportunity use the facility that day 
429280,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, the spa was perfect from our arrival to leaving They noted down in the system that it was my boyfriends birthday without me asking and greeted him happy birthday and put balloons and a little cake in the room We had an aromatherapy massage each and we both left feeling revitalised and refreshed The staff were amazing everyone was very welcoming and helpful Can not fault anything 
429281,K West Hotel Spa, The check out desk on the sunday morning was a little slow they seemed a little overwhelmed by the amount of people which a hotel of that size should have been able to cope with , The staff were really helpful accommodating The hotel had a really fun vibe 
429282,K West Hotel Spa, The hotel absolutely stunk of human waste Burst pipe according to a cleaner The whole hotel was so hot which made the smell even worse The carpet on the downstairs floor was in a terrible state The spa was too busy for the size Second visit and disappointed this time, On a positive note the room was comfortable and clean Reception staff were friendly helpful and welcoming
429283,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, The hotel is fantastic staff helpful and always welcoming with spa facilities top class The dining experience is good with extra effort made to make my girlfriend feel special on her birthday Will definitely stay here again and in room 501 Thank you 
429284,K West Hotel Spa, I was weakened up by a couple arguing in the corridor but this was nothing to do with hotel I should have rung reception but when I realised it wasn t outside they had quutened sown, the staff were very friendly and helpful
429285,K West Hotel Spa, Hallway carpet needs to be replaced not a good first impression Our room didn t smell very nice at all when we arrived , The bed was very comfy It was my fianc s birthday and they had put balloons and a lovely happy birthday plate with macaroon and chocolate brownie in our room White company products 
429286,K West Hotel Spa, Can t think of anything , The fragrance in the foyer was superb I would love to know what it was A lovely welcoming feeling on arrival All the staff we met were very friendly 
429287,K West Hotel Spa, All of the additional costs for parking breakfast deposit etc etc The reception staff were lacking personality and spoke very little English and didn t appear very knowledgeable of the services available at the venue ,No Positive
429288,K West Hotel Spa, Service for breakfast in the morning had to get menus ourselves had to ask someone to take our order after people who came in after us had their order taken got offered tea or coffee and didn t receive after 10 mins waiting and seeing others get theirs it so had to ask a another member of staff to get it for us scrambled egg was runny and orange , The room was lovely bed comfy and really BIG
429289,K West Hotel Spa, The pillows room 600 suffers from smells from the kitchens extractor fan , The location is great and the hotel is overall pretty good Its a very long hotel as its actually built on an old tube line so I would recommend asking for a room as close to the front as possible 
429290,K West Hotel Spa, 1 Staff member advised me incorrectly about the parking which got me a 100 ticket from valet Because i was acting on her info i didnt have to pay was not impressed tho V important staff give the right info no other issues , Loved verything room with Bose stereo spa with selection of fruit infused cold water the staff the service and food It was my birthday and the extras were a lovely surprise 
429291,K West Hotel Spa, 2 single beds were pushed together to create a bigger bed Was quite uncomfortable for me my partner to sleep together without feeling the edge of both bases of the bed s going through the mattress ,No Positive
429292,K West Hotel Spa, My friend checked in for me and use her credit card first I would like to change to my credit card The staff told me it s OK and inserted my card when I payed one day before checking out The machine seems got some problems and then changed another machine again Finally today morning I found still paid by my friend s credit card Maybe you should consider to change a new credit card machine I am so upset because this small mistake will make my budget cancellation extremely complicated , location is convenient Special device handy is very useful for foreign people Room is also clean and comfortable
429293,K West Hotel Spa, The breakfast is a stupid price considering the content but it is London The safe in the room was tiny couldn t fit my DSLR in there or my MacBook which was annoying The plug in the sink was quite dirty just a little niggle but didn t bother me too much , Spa was really lovely and for only 10 each it makes for a relaxed evening Really close to the Westfield shopping centre and Shepherd s Bush tube station on the central line Staff were very polite and attentive The room was lovely thank you for the birthday surprise it was a lovely touch Loved that we could control the temperature of the room and having access to a tablet and travel buddy in the room was really useful Bed was really nice and comfy the hotel felt modern and secure Very clean as well 
429294,K West Hotel Spa, I booked an executive room but minibar was empty Access to gym for executive rooms shouldn t be chargeable , The spa was great The food order facility was brilliant 
429295,K West Hotel Spa, I loved it all , Came for our wedding night and were given a free upgrade to a suite Our room was spacious very stylish and with a fabulously comfortable bed The atmosphere in the bar very chilled and the perfect way to wind down with friends after our wedding Great music cocktails and bar staff 
429296,K West Hotel Spa, The room temp would not go any lower then 18degrees and it was a very warm day so we were rather warm in the room , The staff welcomed us amazingly and were happy to add onto the room any extras when I asked As it was a occasion they gave us our first drinks with dinner on the house which was amazing 
429297,K West Hotel Spa, Drinks quite expensive and unfortunately my Ipad went missing from my room but by the time I realised I left it in the room the next guest had booked in the staff were very helpful in trying to find it but no luck as of yet, lovely modern clean room helpful staff and easy to use facilities we also had very very little noise disturbance which was lovely as we were only along the corridor from the bar area where they played music until late The spa was a real treat and well worth the extra 20
429298,K West Hotel Spa, Felt customer service was average and was disappointed with the lack willingness to look after customers who offer repeat business Bottled water in the room would have been nice or access to the fridge proper coffee lacking in the room and cold food with room service It is attention to detail that makes a stay special and it is missing , Large bed Quiet room 
429299,K West Hotel Spa, Reception and bar staff not very efficient Everyone very pleasant but process of checking in and checking out very laborious Bar staff brought wrong drinks as we knew she would because she was blatantly not listening to our order Food took forever and was very overpriced for what we got , Bedroom very comfortable We requested extra blanket and it arrived almost immediately 
429300,K West Hotel Spa, Although parking on site was useful when we collected our car it felt as though we were rushed to leave , the travel phone is a good incentive although ours didn t work we could see the potential 
429301,K West Hotel Spa, The wait at the spa was excessively long there weren t enough seats for everyone waiting Having to sit in a short dressing gown in a crowded room with several men is not my idea of a relaxing way to wait for a spa treatment The wet area was also crowded and was much smaller than it looked in the photos Apart from the wonderful massage the whole spa experience was very disappointing Toiletries in room not replaced until I asked Not enough breakfast tea bags supplied Bed too hard No slippers provided in room , Leo the masseur was magic one of the best massages I have ever had Reception staff were helpful 
429302,K West Hotel Spa, Feel the hotel is tired the room I had certainly was and the shower was very poor Wasn t a great location for site seeing or being central Great for Westfield centre though , Staff where great
429303,K West Hotel Spa, WiFi was terrible , Room spacious bed was large very comfortable Facilities very good staff friendly helpful Excellent location 
429304,K West Hotel Spa, The noise when you flushed the toilet very loud , It was my wife s birthday when we got back to the room after our night out there was a nice surprise of a birthday card and a chocolate treat from the staff 
429305,K West Hotel Spa, Couldn t fault anything, The staff just couldn t do enough for us When someone else took our taxi they went out of their way to get us another immediately and everyone was so cheerful and personable 
429306,K West Hotel Spa, My only concerns was the wifi was slow on occasions and the area you walk through to get to the main road looks abit iffy and would probably be quite intimidating to some people especially at night for me it wasn t an issue as it s only a 200yard walk and I m from Manchester so I m used to the dark dingy streets at night , Staff was amazing hotel was amazing a spa to top it all off Being as it was our anniversary we wanted a romantic hotel that was close easy to get into central London and this was definitely the perfect choice on arrival we was given a free upgraded room and VIP passes to Westfield shopping centre we was greated by a bed full of roses shaped into a love heart and 5 minutes into the stay a knock on the door from the chef with a plate of goodies and happy anniversary written in chocolate Staff was super helpful through out the stay and would have what ever you needed with you in less then 5 10 minutes weather that s food or drinks or a member of the team to help you get back in your room because you picked your bank card up instead of your room key on the way to the amazing spa D amazing hotel will 110 definitely visit again made our anniversary that extra bit special 
429307,K West Hotel Spa, I noticed that there was rust in basin drain Not something I would expect to see in a 4 star establishment , The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the room a nice temperature The spa facilities were outstanding The staff were also very attentive and ensured the best possible experience Thoroughly enjoyed my stay 
429308,K West Hotel Spa, Room needs a little maintenance No sockets near bed Superior bed was 2 singles pushed together Socket under desk loose faceplate and cable behind bedside table was exposed from flex Had to pay a supplement to use the facilities , Location and Facilities
429309,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, Cannot fault anything everything was 10 10 We didn t use any of the facilities or the spa but if we did I would be very confident they would be excellent The food in particular was superb Very friendly staff right the way through Comfortable room nicely located with a few minutes walk from the underground and shopping centre This is our second time here and it was just as good as the first and we ll be definately planning a third visit Overall it is a high end hotel ideally situated for travel and leisure at an excellent price 
429310,K West Hotel Spa, Honestly nothing springs to mind Can t fault it , Location was perfect Close to shopping and to the venue we were attending Staff were helpful polite and friendly without exception Rooms were spotless and with all amenities and facilities Entire hotel is classy modern and elegant yet with a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere We were making a return visit and would certainly return again 
429311,K West Hotel Spa, As soon as we got to the hotel to check in the guy behind the reception desk was on the phone to somebody saying things like do we have anything else available which made us panic Also when checking out I had to hand over my card again for payment even though I did this already at check in I m assured that I will not be charged twice for the room and that the first payment will be refunded back but I really don t understand why they don t just accept the first payment instead of taking it again and cancelling the first one This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and really worried now I will be charged twice for the room, The room was beautiful and very cosy 
429312,K West Hotel Spa, Nothing it was perfect for us, The bed was lush and everything was perfect we did not use the spa as we was very busy but all hotel team was helpful and wonderful it was my partners birthday so they did champagne and chocolate cover strawberries balloons it s was perfect and got a free upgrade to the excite suite x
429313,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, Everyone in the group is allergic to feathers I always phone the hotel a few days before to request foam bedding Most hotels ignore this and we then have to call up and wait before the bedding is changed This is the first hotel I ve stayed in where the bedding was changed before we arrived This made things so much easier and less stressful 
429314,K West Hotel Spa, I think the parking should be free for one night stay or the cost of a nights stay should be lowered , For 17 99 I chose a full English breakfast which was far to expensive for what I got it should have been a buffet to which I had the option to have more Very tasty thought 
429315,K West Hotel Spa, More choice of food in the bar but plenty of resturants close by at the Westfield shopping Center , Hotel in a good location and comfortable rooms Close to Westfield Center and Olympia which was our reason for going
429316,K West Hotel Spa, If they had some moisturiser in the room even a small bottle , This hotel has set a new standard for me The hotel was immaculate it really was The double room was huge absolutely huge and extremely clean beyond clean it was spotless in every inch However all that aside what stood out was the staff I have never seen anything like it every single member of staff would say politely greet you Every single one from the receptionist to the waiters in the kitchen to the cleaners have really raised the bar A true credit to themselves in every way I can go on for days about the staff but overall a great stay all round 
429317,K West Hotel Spa, The shower in the room wasn t great And got the floor pretty wet , Friendly staff and lovely rooms And the spa was great Booked to rooms for 4 of us and they made sure we were on the same floor 
429318,K West Hotel Spa, First room I had did have a bad smell I reported it and immediately was transferred to another much nicer room , Nice room great location close to tube station and large Westfield shopping center Staff very friendly 
429319,K West Hotel Spa, I Booked a room which is 26squaremeters they gave me 9sqmeters They changed it later after I complain about it It is a very old hotel but renoweted , Personel was really nice 
429320,K West Hotel Spa, The room size wasn t Big enough so we had to pay 30 to upgrade we wanted to use the spa but you have to pay 20 pp to use the facilities most hotels naturally include this,No Positive
429321,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, Brilliant service unfortunately I woke with a dreadful cold but a wonderful lady who was with the breakfast team gave me honey lemon and ginger in hot water which eased my sore throat Above and beyond thankyou 
429322,K West Hotel Spa, Dont no why i had to pay extra for the spa facilities was lead to believe it was included in the overall price Breakfast wasnt worth 17 each for me and my partner, Appreciated they had sent a card and small cake to our room for my partners birthay 
429323,K West Hotel Spa, Parking was way too expensive The staff was not trained properly nothing was explained clearly SPA was extra money and it was not worth it at all You basically have to pay for everything and get nothing in return I would not recommened it especiall if you re couple going to get away for a little while In addition to this it was so intimidating everyone is staring at you constantly even the staff ,No Positive
429324,K West Hotel Spa, the fact that we didn t have any wi fi was very annoying and the film option wasn t available so I felt like I paid 250 just for a nice bedroom and spa which I have just paid 35 for the day Then went home to my bedroom was which is just as nice I have been to your spa before I came in December with my boss which I gave to her as a gift and I was disappointed in the treatment the spa was lovely again but it was a lot hotter which I prefer the massage was an aromatherapy massage on paper and deep tissue in practise it was painful when aromatherapy is relaxing usually and no aromatherapy oils were used so I felt as if I had been robbed a bit but the overall experience was ok we had afternoon tea also which was lovely , the room was lovely and the spa was lovely 
429325,K West Hotel Spa, The staff were rude the manager charged my card loads of times without my permission the breakfast was horrible the taps in the bathroom did not work everything is over prices and not worth the prices the staff are clueless Will not be staying here again, The spa
429326,K West Hotel Spa, Bins being picked up very early in the morning was quite loud and woke us up but it s a minor complaint, The bed the Tv the tablet the room overall was great

429330,K West Hotel Spa, Very disappointed it is advertised as spa hotel yet when I went to use sauna I was told it would be an extra charge The corridors smell of marijuana and it felt more like a student hostel than hotel I didn t feel it was value for money, It was quiet
429331,K West Hotel Spa, Restaurant meal very poor Moth problem throughout hotel room spa area packed so didn t get to use while wife got her treatments, Great staff Bed Bar Music Spa treatments Breakfast Bar snacks delicious

429334,K West Hotel Spa, I didn t like the interior of the bathroom The shower was very hard to work to get the right temperature and pressure We ordered room service and the pizza was horrible and cost us 17 in total which is a rip off I also think check out time at 11am is too early I also think after paying 109 for one night you should be able to use the pool area I was all set to go until I found out even hotel guests have to pay 20 each to get into this area , I liked the bar area at reception it was lively and had a good atmosphere The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean I liked that I could use the gym facilities I liked the provision of bath robes and slippers 
429335,K West Hotel Spa, Only downside is the mini bar doesn t offer snacks or fizzy drinks only water or alcohol but it wasn t a massive issue , Me and my boyfriend came down for the dentistry expo at London Olympia and the hotel is in a gr at position if you re attending anything at the Olympia It cost us 13 for a taxi black cab but we realised it was only a 10 minute walk from Olympia and Westfield Shopping Centre restaurants so that was a massive positive We stayed in the K suite and it was lovely Massive Lounge area big bedroom with an amazingly large and comfy bed bathroom with everything you could possibly want the room was great We decided to stay an extra night and the staff changed it over effortlessly they helped us throughout our stay and we couldn t sing their praises any more Overall great hotel will definitely return

429349,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, Lovely hotel at a great price Room was lovely and bed very comfy Visited spa which was fab and really relaxing All staff were pleasant and helpful Visited the bar across from reception a couple of times and the guy behind the bar was always really good at recommending different drinks to try all of which were yummy Location was good with Westfield shopping centre only about 5 mins walk away with loads of great shops and restaurants My boyfriend and I had a lovely weekend break here and will definitely be back 
429350,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, We booked here for the London Horse show and it didn t disappoint Really welcoming staff Lovely room with comfortable beds Great Location for Olympia Westfield Fab food 
429351,K West Hotel Spa, The breakfast wasn t up too the standard of the money they charged for it 3 small crossiants and a couple of muffins and pastries delivered too your room for 15 per person and that was for two people The same can be said with the restaurant menu as well , The staff and was very nice and clean with good facilities in it The staff who work there are extremely helpful and welcoming and made us feel at home
429352,K West Hotel Spa, The view from our room wasn t that great so had to keep the curtains closed most the time the restaurant does not have a wide choice of food to choose from menus was very limited I love good food so was abit disappointing for such a nice hotel Also annoyed about separate charge to use the spa as a hotel guest I believe this should be included as part of your stay , 24hour room service although I could not get through to them on room phone customer service was excellent highly recommend spa staff spa itself was lovely Hotel Room was very clean and big 
429353,K West Hotel Spa, The cleaners came in the room whilst I was sleeping which I didn t really like but they was just doin their job so I will allow it and also please please please change your coffee it was doo doo , I loved the bed it was so comfy and also I like it how you gave a phone and a pad in the room just for us keep it up you ll go places
429354,K West Hotel Spa, We truly have nothing that wasn t fine The only thing that was a bit pity is the fact that our shower only had cold water and the bath was rather on the small side But none of this was something that had a heavy impact on the greater picture , We had a wonderful trip to London and the K West Hotel Spa made it complete It had a good location and there was a great welcoming from the staff at every place And the facilities where great In the morning there was a delicious breakfast Only something of the card was more than enough but it was also a possibility to take something of the buffet downstairs Every night we drank something in the bar there was nice music and it was a lovely and relaxing place On our last evening we spend some time in the spa Especially the snowcabine was awesome 
429355,K West Hotel Spa, I couldn t fault our stay here I wish it was longer , The Hotel is a beautifully tucked away from the hustle and bustle of a busy London street But yet perfect location for Westfield shopping centre Kensington etc The staff were exceptionally friendly and the dinner was amazing Highly recommend the pork belly 
429356,K West Hotel Spa, The shower needs temperature control Water from the shower was boiling hot Rm 500 and I had to cover my arm with a towel to move the handle Very dangerous Not enough room to do it This could cause severe scalding ,No Positive
429357,K West Hotel Spa, cold draft from the window but that s all I can remember It was really a great stay, Amazing staff and service I will go there again Well located Comfortable stay and was welcomed with some baby essentials never had it elsewhere Food from room service is great too 
429358,K West Hotel Spa, Room was quite disappointing it was large but very uninspiring net curtains looked dirty and bathroom looked a bit tired Chambermaid knocked on our door at 8 30am when we were still in bed Called hello and they went away but 10 minutes later knocked again when I was in the bathroom and came in the room My daughter was still in bed , Room was quiet and bed was quite comfortable Hotel was easy to find and very close to tube 
429359,K West Hotel Spa, We were on leverl 1 and the smell of drains in the passageway frtom the spa was unpleasant Alsdo found breakfast very disorgasnised compared to previous visits, Great location good value for money
429360,K West Hotel Spa, Nothing , Recent stay whilst visiting Olympia Great location 10 minute walk from Olympia Staff very friendly and helpful The cookies whilst checking in out lovely touch Balloons and cake for a birthday also lovely touch Breakfast was plentiful and s great choice Will definitely return in the near future 
429361,K West Hotel Spa, I was very disappointed with your afternoon tea it was not worth 25 a person there was not a lot to choose from everything that was brought out was not the best selection and there was not a good variety, All the facilities was great room was lovely
429362,K West Hotel Spa, We only booked this Hotel because of the famous Spa but it was closed due to a faulty pool so we had travelled from Midlands at expense on train for nothing as could not use the facilities and so had to leave early as checked in late after long journey so went out for dinner expecting to use the Spa and pool the whole next day but our plans ruined due to maintenance problem with their pool Not given refund or compensation Only chose to stay at this Hotel to use the K Spa We also not allowed to use our K friends membership discounts or benefits as booked external rather than direct with Hotel , Good location for tube station and West field shopping centre very clean modern Hotel with super friendly staff 
429363,K West Hotel Spa, I didn t like that my booking did not make it clear that the spa was not included in my package and that this was an additional charge when arriving at the hotel As this increased my overall budget which made it very uncomfortable for me and was quite embarrassed when i didn t know that it was something i hadn t paid for ,No Positive
429364,K West Hotel Spa, Stayed on first floor and there was a smell of sewers all down the corridoors we went for breakfast in the hotel and after waiting 40 minutes left with none We stayed in room 123 for 2 nights and each night received 4 calls in the early hours from other hotel guests trying to order room service which kept waking my baby up , Big bed modern room
429365,K West Hotel Spa, Check in could have been earlier 3pm seems late , The bed was extra large and very comfy The room layout was great with very large TV on swivel base for ease of viewing from both ends of the room

429368,K West Hotel Spa, Paying a service charge for drinks ordered at the bar , Staff were very friendly welcoming and helpful We were upgraded for free and as it was our anniversary we had rose petals on our bed a card and some nice brownies and macaroons delivered to our room 
429369,K West Hotel Spa, Nothing we didn t like at all , I had high expectations of this hotel I wasn t disappointed A real gem of a find the staff were lovely the room was beautiful and the spa was just what we needed to start our day Had my favourite breakfast before leaving beds were comfy and the room was very quiet which was lovely after a very busy noisy day PS if you use the spa you just have to do the Snow room awesome 
429370,K West Hotel Spa, Service door near our room constantly slamming Really annoying especially early in the morning A self closing mechanism would probably be a much better idea , Comfy bed Big telly Helpful staff I liked having a tablet in the room 
429371,K West Hotel Spa, Disappointed as booked deluxe room Room was very tired and could have benefitted from a makeover certainly not deluxe Whole hotel generally smelt of damp Issues with pre arranged check in, Location was great for purpose Shepherds Bush Empire
429372,K West Hotel Spa, Spa not in great condition Chewing gum on the bottom of the salt tray by the foot spa Reception team not good at all Need training maybe Before arrival I phoned to check the reservation and was on the phone for 30 mins Still wrong on arrival which was embarrassing as I had booked for 3 work acquaintances Then on check out struggled with a VAT receipt , great location for the tube 
429373,K West Hotel Spa, Room wasn t quite ready when we arrived so were given free drink vouchers that stated cocktail on it When asking bar staff what cocktails we could get with the voucher they rudely said none were available with the voucher After pointing out that it says cocktail on the voucher they just said no we can t have one , Friendly front desk staff Excellent room Comfy bed Great location 
429374,K West Hotel Spa, There was a party going on at the bar which is located next to the entrance reception receptionist couldn t even hear me properly , The bed was extra comfy room was clean and had a very cosy feeling Had a small couch good size tv 
429375,K West Hotel Spa, Noisy guests shouting all through the night Disappointed with lack of nightlight as described as busy cool with a resident DJ there were non of these ,No Positive
429376,K West Hotel Spa, Hotel corridor was dirty stains in carpet horrible location of room I paid just under 600 it was not worth one penny , I liked how polite and friendly the staff was 
429377,K West Hotel Spa, the 1st room I was allocated smelt slightly stale and backed onto an alleyway which made me feel slightly insecure They changed me immediately to a better room higher up when I asked, lovely spa and very nice staff
429378,K West Hotel Spa, Everything is an additional charge The reason people come to K west is for the spa so to be told that we had to pay extra to use the spa was ridiculous The spa facilities are nice however it is one room with the optional parts you can use nothing fancy at all Will I stay here again No The final amount I paid I may as well have stayed in central London , Friendliness of the staff
429379,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, The Gym was amazing Best one i ve been in for a hotel Really close to Shepherds Bush underground and overground station and Westfield London which was amazing 
429380,K West Hotel Spa, Didn t get a parking space but I guess it s good that the hotel even had parking, Good space in the rooms fantastic facilities Loved the room service too 
429381,K West Hotel Spa, I was absolutely appalled that after trawling the Internet for a spa getaway for my boyfriend and I we were expected to pay EXTRA to use the facilities upon arrival in our swim wear I am just very glad we went mid week and didn t have to pay the full 30 per person for weekend use I ve never known a hotel to charge guests to use the facilities and not even at a discounted rate I was also incredibly suprised to be whacked with a 50 bill for parking upon departure Apparently this information was included in the booking but should be a whole lot clearer If I d known all of these extra costs were going to be thrown in I would ve booked a travel lodge as the hotel itself was not worth any more money ,No Positive
429382,K West Hotel Spa, Whilst we did appreciate a late check out on Sunday we would of preferred a check in at midday on Saturday instead of 3pm , Very welcoming decor and accommodating team room very comfortable 
429383,K West Hotel Spa, Treatments weren t fantastic for the money they charge had full body massage but the therapist didn t massage arms at all and pedicure was meant to be 55mins but was 40mins, Could not fault the staff they were very welcoming 
429384,K West Hotel Spa, Hotel room key didn t register at one point However staff was on site and helped with the situation Only had to go to the reception to get the key updated , The staff was amazing and very helpful Location was a great place Underground right around the corner and O2 empire 7 minute walk from the hotel as well They lend you a free phone to take with that is fully functional to making calls search the internet and so much more 
429385,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, Our room was upgraded which I thought was a lovely touch All the staff were extremely helpful and polite Excellent location if you wish to relax as it s away from too much noise but also perfect if you like to shop with Westfield close by 
429386,K West Hotel Spa, Very spartan bedroom comforts stiff pillows no blanket no extra bathroom toiletries such as cotton wool pads or ear buds Awful sound proofing I could hear the guy next door sneezing and even worse exactly when he went to the loo Limited room service no fresh juice or smoothies Over priced wannabe hipster hotel which needs to remember about the basics expected by regular hotel travellers and not just one night in the town folks , Great staff and good location
429387,K West Hotel Spa, Previously stayed here in a king size bed and found this perfect however upgraded this time to a super king and found the mattress to be on the hard side , Location is ideal for both use of the underground and overground The Westfield shopping center is just around the corner with plenty of shops and restaurants along with a cinema 
429388,K West Hotel Spa, Appalling cost of breakfast badly supplied bedroom no iron no spare comb brush pathetic selection of tea no biscuits Terribly small and non relaxing spa Looks tired in public areas, Fantastic bedroom size Fantastic location 
429389,K West Hotel Spa, I have to say that there was a problem with the air conditioning in our room but as soon as we reported it at the reception one of the kind staff gave us a bigger room as a complementary which was great , The staff were increadbly polite and friendly The atmosphere was very chilled and comforting I highly recommend it to anyway who s looking for a little getaway 
429390,K West Hotel Spa, Extremely expensive whole place felt like it was full of hidden charges PRICE DISPLAYED IS NOT ACCURATE I got to the hotel having paid in full and was charged an extra 125 pounds for holding was not informed by the hotel at all was told it was for holding but I would not get it back wasn t told why or even what holding was , Overall okay location was good staff were okay not great 
429391,K West Hotel Spa, Room was on first floor damp and smelled Had to convince the person taking the room service order that I had placed my credit card on file the night before so I could actually get breakfast , Close to Olympia
429392,K West Hotel Spa, The location is great for visiting Westfield Centre but that s about it It s a long way out from central London Prices of food and drinks very expensive but you accept it as its London , Lovely modern hotel spacious room Luxury feel to it Great bar Lounge area
429393,K West Hotel Spa, it was truly all good , The staff made this hotel excellent they could not do enough for you from the door man right across the board Well chosen staff who give their best are worth so much 
429394,K West Hotel Spa, The parking attendant could ve been a bit more friendlier My parents had never had valet prion before so were slightly confused There was a stark difference between the staff at reception and the valet , The staff made my parents feel extra special by going an extra mile for them The lady at reception during that time was super friendly and even gave us an upgrade The spa was also amazing even though it s quite small it still does an excellent job The room itself is extremely comfortable with a comfy and spacious bed It included a TV and a lounge area with tea amenities You definitely feel at home because of how comfortable it is but with added luxury and a nice modern touch It was clean and neat also 
429395,K West Hotel Spa, Felt room was a lot smaller and nowhere near as luxurious as photos portrayed Also there was lots of rubbish under the bed when I had to get something from under it , Good location
429396,K West Hotel Spa, My colleagues and I didn t particularly like being in the basement rooms The view out of my window was not good but the curtains were closed all the time As we weren t spending much time in the room this didn t really matter Also there was a slight drainage smell which was dealt with by the staff and the plumbing was quite noisy when in use Unfortunately we were unable to move rooms as the hotel was fully booked , Great location for eating out and access to transport Lovely contemporary rooms with great cosmetics Comfortable bed The spa looked lovely but we didn t have the time to use it The musical history of the hotel makes this a unique place to stay 
429397,K West Hotel Spa, The pillows and bed could have been softer and the service for breakfast took half an hour at times , I loved the phone and tablet with free internet and apps to travel around London that were at my disposal in the room Fantastic idea 
429398,K West Hotel Spa, A little tricky to locate on map as it doesnt explain the small ramp of the high street to take in order to find it , A warm and friendly welcome and a card and treat left in our room for our anniversary
429399,K West Hotel Spa, too much air condition in the room very dry air in the room noisy boiler, Location Atmosphere Spotless and contemporary interior design Layout of the room and its space
429400,K West Hotel Spa, Spa not included in the price, The room layout and decor were excellent with very pleasant helpful staff Definitely staying again next time we visit London
429401,K West Hotel Spa, Nothing, Natasha on reception was very kind and helpful I had placed my reservation via Booking com a few weeks previous but when I arirved at the hotel they had no confirmation of my reservation as it had not been sent to the KWest team from Booking com She 100 looked after me and reassured me contacted Booking com and resolved the issue for me 
429402,K West Hotel Spa, Nothing , Every member of staff we came across were so lovely Our confirmation stated our room wouldn t be ready until 3pm yet it was ready when we checked in around 1pm We were also upgraded to an executive suite The hotel was very clean and very aesthetically pleasing 
429403,K West Hotel Spa, I m struggling for a negative the only thing I can think of is that it was a bit warm in the breakfast room , The best staff I ve come across they couldn t do enough for us The cooked breakfast was lovely with a great selection of cooked on demand items 
429404,K West Hotel Spa, If I was going to complain it would be about breakfast if your not a pork eater don t order a full breakfast continental is a better cheaper option Also your better going down to breakfast rather than ordering room service as there are more option available in the restaurant , It s location was great the welcome was nice no pretence the reception and bar area intertwine giving you that city feel you expect trendy yet refined loved it If your looking for a city break in London Town this is one of my favourites 
429405,K West Hotel Spa, Bathroom needs an update there is room for improvement The toilet had some flushing issues and the shower was noisy , Clean spacious and comfortable the room was great overall with friendly staff good room service and a great bed Perfect for the carnival weekend 
429406,K West Hotel Spa, Charging for the spa as a paying guest is a bit much Breakfast expensive Long walk to room 540 Room service tray not cleared for 24 hours after repeatedly asking for it to be taken, Staff very friendly and very helpful
429407,K West Hotel Spa, Didn t like that the lift did not go up to the 7th floor where my room was and I was not informed Also it smelled of drain in the hallway it seemed like we were not part of the hotel, The staff on the spa were excellent also the facilities were also very good
429408,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, From the moment we checked in the staff were friendly it was so easy to get to from the tube each day the staff checked that we were happy with the cleanliness of the room loved the ice machine an excellent stay
429409,K West Hotel Spa, The location the room was not great I would have like to have gotten a better room in terms of view from the window The room was soo far from the lift to main reception The wifi did not work at all the sign was not recognised Im sure that had something to do with where our room was situated The toilet flush handle was slightly broken so each toilet visit required two flushes The hot water in the shower was not really hot The shower was ridiculous The amount of water coming out was like niagra falls im sure the knob was broken I left a note when making my booking and explained to a staff member over the phone before coming the purpose of the trip and the fact that it was my fiances birthday so i expected a better room for what i paid for for one night Also I do feel a bit cheated as i am a member of the K friends club I thought I would benefit from some of the discounts such as 10 off breakfast included guanteed room upgrades however it states that these deals can only be used wen booking from the offical site When I tried to book from the site there were know avaliable dates for the date i required so i was forced to purchase off of another site After when i spoke to a member of staff and explained the situation she stated their are avaliable rooms so she doesnt no why it didnt let md book She said she was not able to honour any of the discounts as i had not booked through the site How frusrating , The bed was very comfy The room was clean The hotel generally looked really good The staff right down to the domestic staff were very pleasant smiling and greeting 
429410,K West Hotel Spa, Nothing like everything , Really nice room in and good location great staff gave us a late check out for free Definitely will stay the again when going out in west London 
429411,K West Hotel Spa, Bathroom very clean good size and excellent towels but decor dark and lighting not great especially at the mirror Shower was old fashioned fixed head and taps not blended mixers so you had to be careful with the hot , Laid back Polite friendly efficient staff not intrusive or pushy Comfortable feel Room smart very clean and reasonably quiet despite nearby rail service Linens changed regularly and cleaning good Bed also comfortable and supportive Superior room was of good size and had a fridge large tv and a computer tablet Free wifi 
429412,K West Hotel Spa, No complaints Will make K West my regular stop over when visiting London , Opted for a la carte breakfast rather than included in advance The kitchen is good The spa is very good value for money 
429413,K West Hotel Spa, Very basic breakfast and slow WiFi , Excellent location close to restaurants and shops five minutes walk to underground station and bus station big rooms very quiet rooms and very friendly staff specially Ms Heaven 
429414,K West Hotel Spa, The pillow provided were very firm but other pillows were provided on request , Bedroom very comfortable and a good temperature Feather pillows provided on request Slept very well 
429415,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, Friendly staff contemporary look beautifully designed and presented room Casual relaxed and cool feel I told about wedding anniversary the room was prepared specially with a card and congrats plate a simple but special gesture I d happily go back 
429416,K West Hotel Spa, We found the view from the room uninspiring but given the location there is little that can be done and we have stayed several times so were aware The positives outweigh this , Excellent location Very large room with comfortable settee We had a broken fridge which was replaced immediately by the staff excellent work We also liked the little cafe 100m down the road with a 3 50 breakfast but I expect this fact to be removed by management 
429417,K West Hotel Spa, I can t think of a bad word to write , The whole room was gorgeous Very spacious The location is great for shopping I would definitely recommend to anyone and I would definitely stay again
429418,K West Hotel Spa, I liked everything, Great staff from start to finish they could not have done any more for us the fact that you could leave your luggage for a few hours after we checked out was fantastic the food at breakfast was superb the room was very clean and coffee and tea supplies were very good th
429419,K West Hotel Spa, The fridge could have been better stocked There were only two small bottles of water in it , The receptionists were pleasant and helpful On arrival my room was upgraded The room was contemporary and clean The hotel spa was a real treat I particularly liked the snow room The hydro pool steam room and sauna were also fantastic a relaxing experience overall my partner and I had a lovely break and we will definitely be going back
429420,K West Hotel Spa, Couldn t put breakfast bill or any other bill from the hotel onto our room number to pay during check out Always had to pay upfront which was inefficient , The room was spacious comfortable and clean Staff were friendly and helpful 
429421,K West Hotel Spa, The price for breakfast was quite high in comparison the Hilton would do breakfast for 10 if you were staying with them and its a large variety of both cooked and continental so I feel an offer for people staying at least one night could be offered It s the only thing that lets down the hotel as it does feel pricey in comparison to other hotels of similar standard , Staff were excellent very helpful and the room was very clean Staff were very helpful letting us have plates cups when we had extra people visit us in our room from their room also guests 
429422,K West Hotel Spa, We didn t have dinner but he breakfast was horrible, Everything was good the staff where great the beds where comfy and clean I would defo come back
429423,K West Hotel Spa, There were dirty dishes from the breakfast in bed left outside people s rooms for several days before they were collected by staff Also feel that the 30 a day charge for use of the spa facilities over the weekend was a bit of a rip off , Rooms were lovely and had comfortable beds and the staff were very helpful 
429424,K West Hotel Spa, Carpets and wallpaper in the corridors were a bit dingy and showed signs of wear Bathroom drainage in the shower was poor No hand held shower the shower head was fixed to the wall and the bathroom flooded whenever I took a shower because the swinging glass partition was not sealed well and water leaked onto the bathroom floor , Room was surprisingly spacious and location near Westfield Shopping Centre was great Staff was also very helpful and friendly from reception to room service 
429425,K West Hotel Spa, Am a wheelchair guest the facility for disable in the room could be better since they don t have a roll in shower in the room I had the room on the ground floor level 3 but I have to go down to level 1 to use the public shower room roll in shower which is inconvenient for me However the staff are very helpful and give me a complimentary parking thru my stay ,No Positive

429427,K West Hotel Spa, Only thing I can fault is how you have to pay 20 to use the spa Although the facilities were good I didn t think it was worth that price I was expecting there to be a swimming pool should have really checked but my partner loved her treatments and the lady gave us a great discount for her birthday so shouldn t really complain too much , Absolutely amazing The staff were so friendly and polite and made the start of our visit to London great It was my partners birthday and the two girls on reception said happy birthday upgraded our room gave us VIP passes for the shopping centre and even left a happy birthday plate with a cake and strawberries in our room

429434,K West Hotel Spa, The staff weren t great There were several issues with my stay overall 1 The staff contacted me about the same issue several times the day before my party was due to arrive It was a simple mix up with my card details yet the staff left me a voicemail stating that they would cancel my booking if I didn t call back immediately As the booking was for a special occasion this was obviously upsetting 2 One of our party s rooms was damp and smelt badly 3 One of our party s rooms was double booked which caused significant delays to our evening activities 4 One of our party s rooms had a shower which didn t work properly 5 A staff member mistakenly entered one of our party s rooms at 9am , The quality of the bathroom and the bed were both good

429443,K West Hotel Spa, My room close to the train line Which made it noisy and I was unable to sleep I suffer from Migraines Due to the noise from the trains I was unable to sleep This was VERY stressful and unacceptable that I had to moved rooms three times I appreciate that these were made to help the situation however three times moving I did not get to enjoy my weekend break which should have been most of all a treat to recharge I have been working extremely hard for the last six months , Bed Location close to my venue 
429444,K West Hotel Spa, Bathroom cleanliness is okay not bad but not that excellent either and the food is not really stunning and doesn t really have a broad range of selection , Nice cozy roomy room comfort bed perfect room adjusted temperatures nice neighbourhood easy access from the shepperd s bush tube station 
429445,K West Hotel Spa, Complaints of music in the suit yet it says on the advert party like a rock star Well if you plan to party think again for 400 a night Don t advertise something if you can t actually do it , Everything about the hotel and staff

429452,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, Friendly and helpful staff Nice and clean hotel with confortable and very quiet room Wi fi working perfectly Close to Shepherd s Bush station In 20 minutes by tube you reach the city center Good value for money
429453,K West Hotel Spa, The small Spa was good but over priced for customers staying The bar was too noisy and not welcoming coming back to at night The open plan library is also inappropriately situated next to the bar Personally I would prefer a hard copy of hotel directory in the room not on line There was a fausty smell damp in our room which I should have mentioned to the staff , Beds were very comfortable The soaps etc were good The staff also helpful The spa was fine but could be larger and available to paying guests Treatments could then be charged 
429454,K West Hotel Spa, At booking in we were told that we had been upgraded which was a nice surprise we were told that we would have a kingsize double bed when we got to our room it was not upgrade it was exactly what we paid for not a problem though it was excellent , Attentive and friendly staff
429455,K West Hotel Spa, Issues with a suite that we booked It wasn t provided and a refund was not offered This caused disappointment and upset and extra money spent has been wasted Very disappointed , Location excellent breakfast good 
429456,K West Hotel Spa, The Spa was way too small and is also open to the public The 30 cost for the spa should be included in the room price it is very overrated by looking at pictures on the website We had to call reception a number of times for things that should have been put in our room that wasn t , The comfort of the hotel room was ok and the staff were great 
429457,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, The staff are truly exceptional Food was awesome Best breakfast I have had for a while Location can t be beat Was in town for conference at Olympia and it was walking distance If you shop at Westfield be sure to get a VIP pass for discounts 
429458,K West Hotel Spa, Lighting in the bathroom wasn t great Terrible for applying make up , Lovely quiet road no traffic noise at all it was great to have a dj in the bar till late which meant that we could come back to the hotel and relax without having to go into London then get cabs etc 
429459,K West Hotel Spa, The spa area is really beautiful but the hot tub was ruined by the power of this way too strong and way too much bleach because of this leaving ur eyes stinging quite badly The rest of the spa is lovely , The bed was really comfy but quite small Lovely entrance to the hotel but found the hallway to the bedrooms very long Loved the Spa area very much apart from one section which I mention in the next column 
429460,K West Hotel Spa, Leaving will be back soon KWest we love you , Loved the fact that our room was quiet even though we were close to the bar and reception areas The beds were comfy The room service was excellent Beautiful room and bathroom Just perfect 
429461,K West Hotel Spa, When we arrived outside we were quite concerned about what we were going to find inside due to the hotel looking so run down and tired The outside of the hotel needs brightening up as it does no justice for the inside inside We also thought the extras breakfast spa etc were a bit pricey considering we had paid quite a lot for our room , We loved how spacious and comfy our room was and the friendly staff made our stay more enjoyable The spa is also a great thing to do 
429462,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and friendly Great overnight parking facility Close to Westfield and the Hammersmith Apollo Would definitely stay again 
429463,K West Hotel Spa, Can be a little noisy on weekends but you can request a quiet room , I love everything about this hotel Clean vibrant hotel great hospitality there is nothing about this place I can fault to be completely honest they have a great bar and restaurant and fantastic spa you can also opt for a quiet room on weekends Great for a solo traveller or couple closed to Westfield shopping centre and close to many great resturaunts and bars 
429464,K West Hotel Spa, The toilet paper was too close to the toilet that it touches you Not too many TV channels variety and there are only 1 French and 1 Italian channels The was no plug for the hairdryer in the bathroom , The location was excellent just a few steps from the underground station also near the Westfield mall The room was big and also the bed We were able to check in early
429465,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, Everyone and everything was superb All the staffs from receptions room services spa and kitchen team have been very helpful and outstanding The room is well presented and clean The cot bed was perfect for our little one and he enjoy the stay so much Will definitely be back in the future
429466,K West Hotel Spa, No access to spa sauna etc without significant additional cost drinks very expensive cocktails over 10 and 12 5 service added to bill Both mean unless you don t care about cost then you can t enjoy the facilities of the hotel which would make it great , Service superb throughout breakfast incredible minutes walk to tube relaxing bar
429467,K West Hotel Spa, Afternoon tea was very very disappointing Sandwiches were dry Scones hard Desserts were not freshly made on the day , Spa and massages were very good 
429468,K West Hotel Spa, extra charge for Spa should not call itself a Hotel and Spa if thats the case serious issues with attempting to take payment twice wasted an hour try to reslove the issue NOT GOOD, room clean and comfortable good room facilites
429469,K West Hotel Spa, Internet could be faster, Beds super comfy room well temperature controlled clean with good service Friendly and helpful staff rooms very peaceful and quiet
429470,K West Hotel Spa, Breakfast not great and a little on the expensive side wifi was a bit hit and miss, the bed was very comfy and the staff were very pleasant and helpful
429471,K West Hotel Spa, View from the room windows not great but to be honest only mention it as I couldn t really think of anything else negative , Two minutes from subway and huge Westfield shopping centre and 5 10 minute walk from Olympia Stadium where we were attending a 2 day event Rooms very clean very comfortable and stylish and met all our requirements Staff were polite friendly and helpful Bar was pleasantly busy without being overly so and great service Didn t get a chance to try out the spa but smelled gorgeous whenever the lift doors opened and would make a point of trying it out next time round We had booked two rooms for myself and my son who is in his early 20s and they put us on the same floor a few doors from each other Just right Close enough to keep in touch but not bug each other He loved the hotel too which suggests it manages to cater to a pretty varied age group but still retains some cool 
429472,K West Hotel Spa, Nothing , The staff really were outstanding everywhere in the hotel Everyone was warm friendly and helpful and seemed genuinely happy to be there The style and vibe of the hotel was modern and fresh but very relaxing I stayed with my 17 year old daughter and we had a ball 
429473,K West Hotel Spa, Bad room in bad location Lots of loud staff moving around and talking loud from 7am outside of our room, Booked this hotel for the spa only to read my email from the hotel a day before traveling that the hotel was shut that day Then our room was 203 which has next to the library area Tables and chairs were being moved at 3am 5am and staff being very loud and not thoughtful a very bad experience and when told the reception on leaving I was just advises to email the hotel manager 
429474,K West Hotel Spa, Staff got very confused as I booked 2 rooms under the same name 1 room for 1 night 1 room for 2 nights I was staying 2 night but they never changed sheets or replaced towels or did any room service when I spoke to reception they still did not get it even when I came to pay the bill Food far too expensive walk round to the Westfield centre plenty of restaurants , Great rooms
429475,K West Hotel Spa, The shower was leaving slightly and the length of corridors to get back to the room, Set up of rooms and having a stereo which was able to connect to a phone
429476,K West Hotel Spa, The water in the bathroom was way to hot no cold water came out We had to pay extra just to use the swimming pool which is normally inclusive in other hotels Which meant we were paying a lot of money just for the room Our keys stopped working and it was a struggle just to contact reception Overall I won t stay here again Completely overrated,No Positive
429477,K West Hotel Spa, Not enough vegetables with my dinner Why so stingy with the veggies Extra ordered veggies were overcooked fit for toothless old citizens, Pleasant attitude of staff in restaurant Loved the pulled pork and the English breakfast
429478,K West Hotel Spa, First night heating didn t work and had to use a portable heater and shower didn t work so maintenance had to be called out so my first nights stay was unsettled 2nd night I paid for an upgrade and again there was an issue with the heating and the television didn t work so then again someone had to be called out so my night was unsettled again they then said they would move me room I waited half an hour and nobody returned it was 1am by this time so I went to bed The day after I checked out the hotel then withdrew and extra 200 out my account for no reason Absolutely horrible experience , The manager Aga was very helpful and nice She does her job very well very understanding and listened to me
429479,K West Hotel Spa, Our room was underground in a basement with no natual light and a concrete wall for a view The reception bar area turns into a hispter disco at night so don t think you ll get a quiet drink Reception check in was slow and understaffed Long queue We were double charged for breakfast While sorting it out we found out the breakfast is 17 via booking com and 10 at the hotel avoid Price paid 199 for room and expensive breakfast ,No Positive
429480,K West Hotel Spa, not as described rooms were small service was slow just wasn t a pleasure food was also very tasteless just a really bad chhoice, some staff were nice close to the station
429481,K West Hotel Spa, Our telly did not work we had a faulty plug which was situated by the large mirror which meant that we had to take it in turns to use the dressing table There was no shower gel provided no docking station provided I have stayed in the Novotel and the room had a docking station situated in it Maintenance work was carried out in the room next door no consideration for the guest that are still asleep , We enjoyed the spa but found that the chlorine was intolerable we the jacuzzi was on 
429482,K West Hotel Spa, We got stuck in the lifts twice during our 5 nights stay and that is unacceptable I ve reported to the reception but never heard back from them at all We had to use stairs after all because we were too scared to use the lifts For the second time the maintenance guy who rescued us was pretty rude unnecessarily I understand his job is not to provide a customer service but I don t think he d have to be rude to us I went to the gym at 6 45 which was supposed to open at 6 30 on weekdays and there was no lights on Some people were already at the gym confused how to turn on the lights Eventually a staff member turned up and turned on the lights but no apologies or anything Staff didn t give us amenity nor towel change everyday maybe for environmental reasons but we needed them 3 out of 5 nights we didn t get enough towels and shampoos etc For 2 of us staying together it was very inconvenient not to have enough toiletry stuff The room key stopped working on our second night Whilst I understand there could be some technology error happening every now and again it was very frustrating coming back to the hotel after a long day walking all the way to our room our room was very far from the reception at 235 went back to the reception and walked back again Could it be avoided to happen Wifi kept getting disconnected It may not be suitable to use for Skype YouTube etc Lifts issues were a big turn off for me becashe even 1 star hotels should have proper functioning lifts and it is a fundamental facility I would expect 4 star hotels to have better maintenance in place , The restaurant and bar are brilliant great atmosphere and awesome food The front of the hotel looks amazing 
429483,K West Hotel Spa, The only thing I didnt like was the service charge of 12 5 Didnt tip any of the staff as felt I had been ripped of with the service charge Hope the staff actually receive some of it , The service and location were great Just down the road to Olympia where we were visiting Down the street to Shepherds bush underground Nothing was too much trouble Lovely bar area Nice room as well and we had been upgraded Valet took my car on Friday and then delivered it to the front door for me on Sunday morning Loved the i pad in the room which I ordered breakfast in bed 
429484,K West Hotel Spa, The taps in the bathroom were old and temperamental and there weren t very many tea facilities The location wasn t ideal and didn t seem particularly luxurious , The room service was great and quite reasonable and I liked the tablet use to book room service or spa facilities 
429485,K West Hotel Spa, Breakfast a pricey extra even the continental You would have to eat quite a lot of croissants to get value for money , Room nice and quiet beds very comfortable Staff friendly and helpful Lovely to keep spotting two wild escaped parakeets in the tree outside our window 
429486,K West Hotel Spa, No soundproofing in the rooms people walking down the corridor sounded like they were in the room Staff were rude in particular Cosmin on the level 4 restaurant was not accommodating at all The room was quite dusty in general the bathroom was run down and had a broken sink plug meaning it took a long time to drain , Reception staff were helpful and friendly The breakfast was nice and had a good selection 
429487,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, Long wait at reception desk both check in and out Great service in the restaurant at breakfast could have had more than just two tea bags in the room 
429488,K West Hotel Spa, Have to pay extra to use spa facilities despite price of the room this is not mentioned anywhere on booking confirmation and was not told at check in breakfast does not cater halal Car park was full so had to park on the main road pay and display Cocktails at bar are very expensive pretty much central London prices if not more and it s not even in central it s west London Prices of rooms should be a bit cheaper as rooms are basic with only 32inch TVs and no bath only shower breakfast wasn t included spa facilities not included , Spa very relaxing room was modern great location can walk to Westfield shopping centre strong wifi staff were lovely and willing to help when needed 
429489,K West Hotel Spa, Spa isn t included in the already too expensive room price And neither is parking For such high priced rooms you expect more than just a basic room Everything is extortionate 11 to rent a film 40 breakfast for 2 30 each just to enter the spa And 25 per night to park , Large bed very comfy Nice bar area
429490,K West Hotel Spa, The app in the room for ordering treatments in the spa was abit confusing and didn t work , The front desk were very polite and helpful The hotel itself was very modern and well presented 
429491,K West Hotel Spa, During my time at the spa there were technicians fixing the lights very dissapointing not relaxing at all, Overall it is a nice comfortable hotel the stuff was friendly and helpful nice white company bathroom products
429492,K West Hotel Spa, Had a lovely time until a member of staff entered my room whilst me and my partner was sleeping And we had a do not disturb sign on the door Hotel manager was very rude when I explained that was unacceptable and did nothing about it Breakfast was terrible service was very slow Over all I would not recommend based on the staff , Spa was excellent lovely bar and cocktails
429493,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, It was our 26th wedding anniversaryand the hotel was our base for a very special couple of days The staff were brilliant and so enthusiastic We were upgraded without asking and we were given an anniversary card from the hotel team and complimentary glass of champers The stay was memorable Many thanks 
429494,K West Hotel Spa, I didn t like the fact we booked parking over the phone and when we got to the hotel they said its full up but they were quick to take the payment out of my card and we had to get up the next morning to look for parking I was not happy at all with the service they provided and all they could offer was a glass of champagne,No Positive
429495,K West Hotel Spa, 2 mins in room and man walked in 10 seconds later female walked in Offered comp breakfast which didnt want so gave me a free drink in bar but was told could have a glass of champagne when it was prosseco Collegues Room was not cleaned toilet had been used and not flushed dirty towel and sheets on bed didnt look fresh She was upgraded but not really room was virtually same as the one she had come out of If you go to the bar to order your drink they put 12 5 gratuity on bill When asked to take it off the Bar staff argued that I am paying for them to serve me but I had gone to the bar , Alosha on Reception 
429496,K West Hotel Spa, Garden room was overlooking a busy road Air vent smelt of sewage had to change rooms at 1am due to overwhelming smell in my room from the vent Overpriced for room rate only , Very friendly staff felt welcomed Clean bed and bathroom 
429497,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, This was our fourth stay at K West and on each occasion we have enjoyed the experience all of the staff are friendly and professional the rooms are clean and modern and the breakfast is very good 
429498,K West Hotel Spa, Walls are thin can hear next door or people upstairs scrapping chairs , The staff were very welcoming The room was a very good size and spacious Clean Very efficient with time and room service 
429499,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, Always a friendly feel and thanks for the upgrade I appreciated that Myself and the team from Symprove are happy with your service and we will continue to book with you 
429500,K West Hotel Spa, My room was quite tired and needing renovation Particularly the leaking shower screen which flooded the floor Value for money wasn t great , Very clean staff were great very helpful and friendly Location was perfect too 
429501,K West Hotel Spa, The hotel state seems to have dropped down hallways look tired carpets are dirty although the rooms are stil in fairly good condition and I have no issues with that in terms of quality Check in and check out can be quite long so be prepared to wait in line patiently , Proximity to Westfield for shopping and dining 
429502,K West Hotel Spa, At the point of check in payment was taken from our debit card for the room and parking plus 25 for incidentals which I don t think was deducted from our final bill upon check out Receptionist quoted a figure which was due upon check out but I had to ask for a printed itemisation She said payment would be taken from the debit card but I did not have to sign anything to confirm the amount which would be taken or enter my pin very vague and confusing We also feel the service charge for each drinks order seems excessive Reception staff member asked how many weeks pregnant I was I am not pregnant just carrying extra weight So a rather embarrasing and poor end to our stay , Location good as visiting Olympia Room clean and tidy 
429503,K West Hotel Spa, The check out process was very poor The girl in the straight black hair just picks people at random for checkout rather than taking people who have been waiting the longest I would not go back to this hotel because of that It is a horrible practice , room and location
429504,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, We booked this hotel after a search for hotels located near to the Eventim Apollo We found the reception staff to be most helpful The hotel restaurant offers a limited menu choice but the food is well presented and tasty The waitress was very polite and welcoming The bedroom was comfortable albeit we found the wifi signal somewhat slow The hotel has a car park for guests but costs 25 per night However we were allowed to keep our car there after we checked out of the hotel We had decided to spend several hours at the Westfield Shopping centre that is a 5 minute walk from the hotel 
429505,K West Hotel Spa, breakfast was not as promised and staff didn t seem to know what was supposed to be included and when we did get the hot breakfast as ordered it was cold having been pre cooked not freshly made the distance from elevator to room is too long , convenient location for us but parking not so easy or rather very expensive small size nice room had space 
429506,K West Hotel Spa, They took money twice for my card they charged us on the same things twice room service calls we had to beg everyday for them to clean the room The hygiene is zero there We booked through booking com for 1 week I had a health problem so had to extend for another 2 weeks so I asked them for the same rate I had and we made a deal to upgrade with only 20 extra At the checkout I was surprised that they put extra money per day on top of the 20 upgrade Overall the whole experience was horrible And if ur looking to book there u must double check the prices when you checkout Bec they charge twice on some things , The room is spacious was close to my sisters house 
429507,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, It was in a great location close to the tube station which made it easy to get around London to visit all the landmarks also it s very close to Westfield Shopping Centre The Staff were very friendly and helpful The room was a good size Overall we had a great stay and would stay there again

429510,K West Hotel Spa, The disco at the weekend Security on the door Nowhere quiet to go after a long hard day of work Very expensive with 12 5 added to every single thing you purchase See through toilet doors in some rooms and a mouse seen running around in the dining room at night , The hotel is a short walk from our place of work Generally a good hotel with helpful staff 
429511,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, The staff were nice the hotel was overall nice was a little disappointed with having to pay extra for the spa as I thought it was complimentary to use the spa as we stayed for 2 nights but besides that I had a lovely stay the room was nice and the area was near to the high street which was amazing thank you for having us 
429512,K West Hotel Spa, Expensive breakfast Had to ask for decaff coffee for the room and decaff tea we got sent up decaff chai Also staff didn t understand English very well , Most of it was good
429513,K West Hotel Spa, A BIT FAR FROM CITY ROOMS AND CORRIDORS A BIT OLD, VERY HELPFULL FRONT DESK STAFF ALOSHA PARTICULARY AND AS WELL FROM THE SPA AND RESTAURANT THEY REALLY MADE OUR VISIT EXCELLENT 
429514,K West Hotel Spa,No Negative, We had a lovely stay here and the staff were so helpful nothing was to much trouble My only regret is that we didn t have time to make use of the spa facilities so we will have to come back again Would highly recommend this hotel Thank you to all at K West may you have a Merry Christmas and a Prosperous New Year
429515,K West Hotel Spa, Door to toilet you can lie in bed and hear everything no door to beautiful en suite The door should have been full length in my opinion , Free upgrade to a suite We live on a farm no street lights etc so did not expect to sleep well Our room 502 was at the front with an exterior glass wall yet the blackout curtains and the triple glazing made the room very peaceful we had a wonderful night s sleep The bed was huge and very comfortable Location excellent for our visit to Olympia 
429516,K West Hotel Spa, Staff not in any hurry to help Would only book premium rate taxis not black cabs , It was within walking distance of Olympia although 15 20 minutes and close to Westfield shopping centre 
429517,K West Hotel Spa, The room was a bit noisy as it was near the street and i could hear planes and vehicles passing by from time to time There was high pitch noise after flusing the toilet , The staff were really friendly and helpful The wafer roll tea and library were nice 
429518,K West Hotel Spa, No swimming pool , Executive Room was nice location near to metro train Westfield mall VUE cinema Halal Resturants house and super market house keeping especially Mrs Tania was very good 
429519,K West Hotel Spa, Was given an upgrade then made to wait for 10 mins only to find upgrade rooms weren t available so a waste of time Use of the spa was additional even for gifts after spending 215 a Giggle on the room it was a bit much to then pay another 40 for the sauna and steam rooms not clear on the website and that s the main reason for us choosing to stay here , Lovely building communal areas were great and fantastic spa Room service was super speedy and efficient food was good great steak we had a suite and it was v spacious incredibly comfy bed 
429520,K West Hotel Spa, The hotel seems like it s very modern and new but the hotel is renewed and it s really old also it s so hidden and you should take care in the night when you go out and come back because it s in a hidden area The hotel its self is so busy this is because it has over hundreds of rooms and you can find only 2 3 people in the reception for check in and check out therefore you need more than 15 20 min to do that However the hotel lobby changed to a night club after 9 pm and there s a DJ mixer plays music which was so noisy to me especially when people got drunk and you ve children and you don t want them to see how they look like In addition i was given a room you need 5 7 min walk to reach it I walk through 3 4 corridors to get into my room Finally for me i don t recommend this hotel at all and i won t come again , to be honest only the Westfield shopping center is the thing for staying in this hotel It can be a good price 
429521,K West Hotel Spa, 5 nights I spent in K West and bathrobe was not changed I payed cash and was asked to leave 150 GBP deposit every day was missed some bath supplies , room size location
429522,K West Hotel Spa, Only disappointing thing was that the television in my room didn t work Somebody came to try to help but couldn t fix it , Excellent continental breakfast which was good value for money Room was very clean tastefully furnished and well equipped Although I didn t use the spa I went to have a look and am very tempted for next time Friendly staff 
429523,K West Hotel Spa, The spa was lovely but should definitely be free for guests , Fab location for some shopping Awesome spa although I do think is should be free for guests Gym is fab food was great and the cocktail bar looked awesome 
429524,K West Hotel Spa, Haha My bathroom phone fell off the wall The valet in the morning dropped my car off without a word Left the engine running and door open and jumped back into his cabin The bed was solid Not even a dent was made in the mattress and the pillows were not comfy , I loved my room loved he layout and the technology available I loved the extension lead by my bed and the vast amount of plugs Room service was flawless the staff were amazing The food was gorgeous By far the best hotel breakfast and evening meal I ve had 
429525,K West Hotel Spa, We didn t use the Spa which we were looking forward to because it was an extra 30 each to use it , The bed was extremely comfy The hotel left us a card and gift for our anniversary which was lovely Great location next to the Westfield Shopping Centre where we decided to park and cost us 9 50 for 24 hours rather than 36 at the hotel Really enjoyed the DJ on the Saturday evening after our meal in the hotel which was reasonably priced 
429526,K West Hotel Spa, Small rooms From reception to my room i spent 5 min walking nothing in the fridge the toilet chair was broken 3 days and they didn t fixed I hear the trains noise, Near from from mall station
429527,K West Hotel Spa, No offer complementary drinking No free water in the room I reached the hotel 9 am and I got the room by 2pm Reception needs more staff 2 is not enough Some reception staff not up to standard , I highly recommend the executive room That was great I Don t recommend the deluxe room I got a great service from Lemta staff working in the reception 
429528,K West Hotel Spa, We got two single beds even though the order said queen size bed Slow service nobody picked up the phone at reception had to wait a long time , Nice room bathtub 
429529,K West Hotel Spa, Only slight drawback was quite a long wait to check in late Friday afternoon But reception staff friendly when we reached them , This was really comfortable with pleasing attention to detail For example decent sized beakers not fiddly cups proper clothes hangers a shower that was easy to work an ironing board and iron in our room 
429530,K West Hotel Spa, Asked for champagne glasses 3 times and never recieved them Over priced and spa facilities not included in price Not worth the money that was paid , Food location and rooms where very nice 
429531,K West Hotel Spa, Breakfast NOT included in booking and allowing guests to eat in the Restaurant in their Dressing Gowns The Hotel should have a dress code for the Restaurant , The decor and facilities were very good and of a high standard
429532,K West Hotel Spa, Very overally priced food expensive Took us 45 minutes just to check out because the hotel tried to charge us twice I would rate this a 3 , Close to Westfield shopping city Friendly staff 
429533,K West Hotel Spa, Two of three night we had neighbours who heard very loud techno music For my friend it was impossible to sleep ONly after we called the y changed something about this Unfortunately we got sick from the breakfast the first Definitely not worth the money The staff was partyl very arrogant especially the waitresses at the Studio Bar , The spa is great to relax 
429534,K West Hotel Spa, The front entrance of the hotel it could do with a refurbish and the floors to the entrance was a little dirty Also the dressing robes provided by the hotel was all dirty which was a little disappointing but other than that 8 10 overall , The fact that the hotel had a dj later on in the evening
429535,K West Hotel Spa, The bathroom was in a state of disrepair I took pics and discussed with the duty manager He gave a discount and said he would use the pics to speak with housekeeping Bathroom let them down badly , Location
429536,K West Hotel Spa, Underground room with a window from which you can see the underside of cars For 150 a night room key fails every day involving a walk back to reception and half an hour of queau Long queau at check in or out , Location it s a two minute walk from shepherds bush 
429537,K West Hotel Spa, The room had a big nasty stain on the carpet near the bed It was horrible becuase it reminder you that others had been in the room , I loved my experience with k spa and because i was celebrating my boyfriend birthday they got him a card ballons and a little cake That was so sweet Breakfast was sooooooooo nice Location is prefect its right near the station Hotel is lively on a friday night so no need to go far Room service was great Food was amazing I loved it and my boyfriend enjoyed his bday I would go again 
429538,K West Hotel Spa, The only drawback really was that the king bed was made up of two single mattresses so there was an uncomfortable groove in the middle of the bed which was a bit inconvenient Other than that was perfect , The staff were lovely they gave us a room upgrade as it was my boyfriends birthday The room itself was gorgeous fabulous bathroom and room with soft robes and slippers Actually would like to live in the room 
429539,K West Hotel Spa, The bed could do with a topper mat , This was not my first stay at the K West but every time i go i enjoy the hotel the staff and the location I wish i could stay more 
429540,K West Hotel Spa, The bar staff were a let down for me They were always so concerned how you were paying a quick to put the bill down before you finish your drink and when ask for another drink they have so do another bill It happens a few times While you are trying to enjoy a drink the questions always start How are you paying the bill when your trying to have a conversation The reception staff were really good happy and helpful , The bed was fabulous so comfy and nice furnishings
429541,K West Hotel Spa, Tatty furniture awful shower set up curtains didn t close properly outdated tv with poor reception no do not disturb sign for door leading to cleaners walking in on me despite having locked it room tablet never worked for full duration despite reception telling me on first day they d fix it room key never worked properly iron completely ineffective no complimentary water price to use spa even as a resident was ridiculous bar extremely over priced , Comfortable bed Nice sofa Good location Express checkout service 
429542,K West Hotel Spa, Price for breakfast exorbitant and this time we had a basement room so no view and a saniflow toilet noisy in the night , Good location pleasant staff big room luxuriously appointed 
429543,K West Hotel Spa, No small toiletries like In most hotels Paid for room by cash but they charged my card aswell Which was abit annoying Didn t get free wifi which was stated in package, Spa and treatments were very good Comfortable bed and good sized room 
429544,K West Hotel Spa, Taxi booked from hotel hour late late for wedding arrived at end travelled from Birmingham just for the wedding to be late Manager not dressed like a manager and as an ex manager wasn t as polite as one either Extra charges that wasn t pointed out clear enough One big towel between two adults also found it a little hard to understand some staffs English Would only stay there again if the cost lowered massively , Bed one of the most comfortable iv slept on 
429545,K West Hotel Spa, The spa facilities weren t included in the spa treatment that was veery expensive compare to what you get The hotel is very expensive compare to what you get,No Positive
429546,K West Hotel Spa, I walk in with a general feeling of meh but this may have to do with me comparing my last abode in Paris to this hotel This did not have the same welcoming ambience or elegance but rather offered a rough and ready tumble with supposed music royalty I just found out this used to be the old BBC recording studios Hence the layout seems utilitarian and caters more to a rock roll vibe My room was quite dated Formica anyone had an old smell every time I open the door and the carpeting from the entrance to the corridors had a general look of grubbiness about it but could just be the retro shade glaring back at me At the time of my stay it looked nothing like the photos being advertised a bit hit and miss really , Central location Room was spacious and had a lounge area Housekeeping were thorough for what they have to work with the personal note is a nice touch 
429547,K West Hotel Spa, Fingers marks all over the stainless steel appliances Very hard pillows Very uncomfortable bed, Check in was excellent Very quiet room Location Great size of room
429548,K West Hotel Spa, Unfortunately we found a staple on the floor When my partner was doing his daily workout spotted it in the carpet Parking should be slightly cheaper , The hotel was in a good location The room sizes are great and very comfortable We were there to celebrate two birthdays the hotel kindly upgraded the room I had booked 
429549,K West Hotel Spa, Continental breakfast choice and quality was poor Not value for money Also the waiter manager is not very friendly or personable Not an enjoyable experience We enjoyed our Premier Inn breakfast more , Thank you for our upgrade The bed in the Executive room is amazing Lovely toiletries Our Banyia Destress massage was very good Aysun is a very skilled therapist 
429550,K West Hotel Spa, Was allegedly upgraded to an Exec room which was in the basement dismal and had absorbed the soapy smell from the Spa Thankfully my room was changed Staff seem very formal and lacking in a welcome Take a tip from hotel staff in the USA they seem to be able to capture a very acceptable balance Bar food and drinks seemed very expensive We stayed afterwards at the Z Hotel in Old Street and was offered a welcome complimentary glass of wine and cheese board now that is reminiscent of a San Francisco Hotel Happy Hour , Location was great for London Olympia
