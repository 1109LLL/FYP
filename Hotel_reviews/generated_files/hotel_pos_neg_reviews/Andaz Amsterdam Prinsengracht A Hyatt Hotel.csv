421334,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, My booking was for two Rooms with canal view but one of the rooms 208 is much smaller than the other room and hardly fits for 2 guests and canal was hardly seen from this room even though I ve to pay same price for both rooms More attention need to be paid to room cleaning to cover dust removal out of furniture and surfaces and to check if provided towels is free from spots before putting in rooms Solution need to be made to integrate the sink in private bathroom, Breakfast was amazing and is one of best two breakfasts I had in hotels abroad during this summer trip Hotel is walking distance from the museum area and shopping streets Neighborhood is quite and safe for families Staff are friendly and cooperative 
421335,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, The only thing I ve noticed through my two stays that when I get the rooms there s always a weird smell in it like a little bit of sewage But after putting perfume it s all good I love this hotel, Everything 
421336,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, I loved everything The only thing I didnt care for was at check out I asked to call a specific cab company as they said a return trip would be 25 vs 45 Euro The staff member who was very nice said she could call another one and they ll all be he same price Well it wasn t It was 45 Euro So that was annoying but I am not going to downgrade the wonderful experience we had over 20 Euro , The hotel has a beautiful modern design and is centrally located which allows you the ability to truly just roam during your stay The staff were very accommodating and extremely nice Breakfast was very good and it is a short taxi or train ride to the hotel from the airport 
421337,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Nothing specific , Hotel and rooms design The staff were so helpful and friendly The hotel is nicely located and in a walking distance from many of the attractions restaurants shops etc The breakfast selection and choices were also nice 
421338,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Abusive videos running on the corridor televisions The menu at the hotel restaurant could have a wider choice , Wonderful quiet location that s still perfectly situated Loved the overall feel of the hotel and the look of it
421339,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, The bathroom is weird , Location is great in the heart of all activities in Amsterdam Hotel service is flawless The room is weird with the bathroom exposed to the bedroom so if you are traveling with anyone other than your wife significant other then privacy is an issue Overall a beautiful experience 
421340,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Comparing to our first stay it seemed the staff was overwhelmed with corporate meetings and large tour groups that distracted from blue chip service Example it took four requests to get a coffee refilled at breakfast It took two requests to get a newspaper delivered I don t remember either of these simple requests being an issue when we stayed there last year , Front desk personnel were exceedingly helpful Hotel is beautiful in a quirky way and perfectly situated for all the things we wanted to do we walked everywhere It was our second visit we were so taken with the place last year Especially liked the assortment at breakfast and after dinner desserts in the bar We stayed in the new back building this year our room was more spacious and better laid out than what I recall 
421341,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Staff during check in were a little indifferent There was no one to help us bring the luggage into the hotel or to put it in the taxi Check in was a bit chaotic Some staff members were great though , Great design very comfortable and spacious rooms Fantastic location 
421342,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, The shower had a little bit moldy smell we had to open the window Other than that all was Perfect , Everything Hotel is hip and beautiful Location is the best Room and bed very comfortable Breakfast is really good Staff very friendly 
421343,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Not much negative at all It took a bit to get used to having the vanity and shower right open near the bedroom It wasn t an issue for us but I guess could be for others , The staff was very helpful and attentive whenever we would stop to ask questions in the lobby they would offer information water bottles and coffee The location is outstanding and our view of the canal made our visit that much more special Very easy to walk to many locations including the museums The food is wonderful and the included breakfast was generous We really loved our visit and would absolutely come back 
421344,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Nothing really one of the best hotels I have ever been in I am a travel agent so I have been in many , Everything except the price of the alcohol in the minibar Hotel Staff and accommodation could not be any better Also the location was the best Centrally located and on a peaceful and quiet street Great place to stay Very comfortable room with a great bed and super nice shire 
421345,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Sink was inside the room Shower was see through Mirror wasn t above the sink instead to the side, My husband and I recently spent a few nights here on our first ever trip to Amsterdam Suffice it to say the Andaz is a gorgeous hotel From the location to the staff to the room everything was near perfection Front desk was throughly polite and helpful Concierge even took the time out to suggest where to go and what to see With the city s obsession with cycling we were pleasantly surprised to learn of the hotel s free bike rentals Room itself was nice if not a tad quirky Will admit however that the bathroom situation was a bit awkward however as the sink was located inside the room While that was strange the only real downside was that the mirror wasn t above the sink a particular inconvenience for men who need to shave instead positioned to the side Otherwise the room was extremely comfortable Mini bar was well equipped with complimentary water and juices Library downstairs near the lobby was also stocked with complimentary water juices and snacks for guests could help themselves All in all the Andaz is definitely recommended especially for those visiting Amsterdam for the first time 
421346,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Nothing everything was great , The whole hotel is modern and funky with quirky touches everywhere you looked The staff were very attentive and exceptionally helpful for check in and all the recommendations and bookings we made The beds were comfortable mini bar complimentary and tea coffee water and snacks were available in the lobby lounge A lovely hotel that couldn t be faulted We really enjoyed our stay here 
421347,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, The music They have a contemporary heavy beat digital music that blares throughout the entire hotel including the restaurant and the quiet library After a day or two it really starts to get to you There is no place in the common areas to get away from this horrible music After a day of sightseeing one just wants to relax and have a drink but it was impossible with this music When I complained about it I was told that it was Friday after all and everyone was in a party mood , The location is great One can walk to any place in the city Food was good property clean and staff friendly 
421348,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Have nothing negative to say , Beautiful property modern and chic with a staff that went out of their way for us The location was spectacular The canal view room was beautiful Loved our stay 
421349,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, The reception staff are expected to do a lot reception concierge and sorting everything out in between The reception did not seem to have enough staff This meant long waits the staff handled it exceptionally well but it was frustrating at times our check in took 15 minutes We personally did not like the concept of the bathroom in the bedroom but that is a personal choice The pillows were uncomfortable as so flat , The staff were excellent and could not do enough to assist us The location and meals both evening and breakfast were delicious with a really excellent choice Free tea and coffee in the lounge is an excellent touch 
421350,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, It took Room service 2 days to fulfill request to pull alcohol from minibar They were supposed to replace it all with water and soft drinks but never did I did that myself, Staff was exceptional from the moment we arrived to checkout Perfect location
421351,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel,No Negative, The staff was super friendly and accommodating They offer an amazing bike tour around the city on Sunday mornings and complimentary wine tasting every evening The hotel was clean and gorgeous very well kept The location was perfect We were able to walk to every destination that we wanted to see while we were in Amsterdam Absolutely loved our stay 
421352,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, I am not fond of the shower being out in the room it s a lovely shower large and with excellent features so my only comment is simply that I prefer the shower and the basin closed I like the water closet separate but all in the same room Just a personal preference One thing that could be done I like the option of pulling the curtain but would have made better use had it wrapped around the shower area with the counter basin oriented parallel to the shower instead giving more space to move around the bed as well But again it was a nice sized room and still very comfortable , The decor the bedding and mattress pillows everything was very comfortable and pleasant The staff was excellent and accommodating I like the offer of beverages at check in and the minibar as complimentary I liked the history of the building and the installation of art work throughout the property 
421353,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, The room was a little small but they utilized the space so efficiently, Loved the location Walking distance to all the important sites Staff was incredible It was kings day and no way to drive up to hotel we used hotel car service 100 from airport and 2 men from hotel met us and dragged our bags the 10 minutes through the streets and canals toget to hotel Hotel was such a find we walked to ann frank house and museums with no problem 
421354,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, I personally would have preferred more privacy for the toilets although the design is great, The rooms were very spacious and beautifully designed The location was great Close to everything and at the same time away from the busy areas The garden is beautiful and the hotel overlooks the canal which is charming 
421355,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Nothing is not perfect at all even the new staff are excellent, This hotel have One of the best service in the world Fast in everything Helpful Modern room fully equipped Best location 6 stars not 5 comparing to any 5 stars hotel in Amsterdam Good welcome in check in
421356,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, i can t fault the hotel It was expensive but you get what you pay for , Stunning hotel great location and great design Staff couldn t have been more helpful
421357,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Please note that observatory king rooms are actually facing the hall of the hotel and do not have natural light ventilation , Amazing experience and great location
421358,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, The breakfast was very hard to understand They call it a buffet but you had to order hot food from the menu as well as go up and get some hot food so one morning I went up to get my eggs and then ask for bacon at the kitchen but by the time the bacon came my food was either cold or eaten On check in the receptionist said our room was her favorite room however the floor plans in the bedrooms show that every room was the same so seemed very rehearsed , Everything about the hotel was great the bars and decor 
421359,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Rather than artistic the decor felt a bit pretentious and although the service was fine it did not live up to the expectations of their high ranking nor the expectations one would have of their price point Layout of room was odd , The rooms were sound proofed so it was nice and quiet The temperature control was good as well 
421360,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Breakfast was expensive 32 euro per person per day Because of that we never checkout the other menus for lunch or evening meal , The shower was amazing Bed was super large and soooo comfortable Free wine and biscuits every night 17 00 19 00 We liked everything 
421361,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Canteen basic atmosphere of the restaurant the food is good and deserves at least tablecloths on the tables , Nice bar area with some good dishes to eat
421362,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel,No Negative, We spent 3 days in Andaz hotel and from the arrival till departure everything was wonderful A wonderful lady name jane greets us with a lot more than professionalism The breakfast was simply great a real lunch thanks to all of you guys 
421363,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, The room doesn t offer the level of confort you are waiting for a 5 star Hotel The option taken to have the sink in the middle of the room is a nonsense This prevents intimacy privacy and tranquillity Of course it gives the feeling to have a larger room and it s quite orignal but not convenient at all and questionable from a aesthetic point of view Morevover rooms are quite small when considering the option taken of an invasive bathroom , The staff is very professionnali and efficient The bar and library with free wine between 5pm and 7pm offres a nice and confortable oppotunity to rest after visiting the city
421364,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Shower looked good but leaked water Not a fan of the room bathroom facilities being open plan But it was very stylish aesthetically pleasing Not a major problem and would not deter us from returning, The hotel is very stylish and usually when places look that cool they feel all style no comfort The andaz benefits from wonderful welcoming staff and we were very impressed at the professionalism whilst still being informal welcoming Excellent location Excellent facilities Excellent personal service and not a faceless corporate feel Loved it
421365,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Confused whether the hotel is trying to be a chic trendy hotel or whether it is trying to be a fancy B B I am a fan of Hyatt hotels and would stay at a Hyatt hotel almost wherever I go However I have to say I had a much better experience at the nearby Dylan than Andaz When we arrived there was inadequate number of staff at the front We were checked in given our room keys and off we went We explored the room ourselves not that It was that difficult The room size is small and we did not have the most basic standard room At Dylan I am not in any loyalty program and I was upgraded to a junior suite during my stay there a few months back And at Andaz I am a platinum level member of the Hyatt loyalty program no special treatment at all I had my stay 5nights stay in 2 reservations and by mistake I booked the second half in a lower room type I was asked to pay to stay in the same room otherwise I have to move to the lower room type So much for being part of a loyalty program Certainly feel so special Room walls are quite thin You can hear when your neighbouring rooms are being serviced or when there is a big party taking place at a function room all the way on the ground floor , The hotel is well located The international staff there are quite friendly and well trained Compliments to The Asian staff and the Aussie staff at the front As for local staff they are courteous some are quite friendly and some are still very dutch style Do like the free daily refill of non alcoholic drinks and snacks 
421366,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Really didn t like the room This is not open plan living it s a small room with a toilet in a cupboard Very disappointing and not good value for money On our return on the first day at 4 30 the room still hadn t been cleaned If the staff hadn t been so pleasant I would not recommend this hotel It s getting more and more difficult to find a good quality hotel , The staff were helpful charming and professional They represent the hotel very well 
421367,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, All pillows are flat as pancakes you press your hand on them and it feels like there s only a bedsheet beneath you The room design with hand basin embedded into a table is trying too hard to be cool The rooms are small don t trust the booking com pictures for them Why can t hotels rooms have 15 20 pictures for a room vs the 4 or 5 shown Why not a photosphere This isn t the only hotel where my expectations fell flat Then onto the food I expect a decent spread for breakfast which unfortunately wasn t there it s a make to order kitchen which can slow things down on busy weekends The staff were friendly but check in was slow Again in this day and age where I can buy a 3100EUR MacBook Pro in 5 minutes why does it take 10 minutes to get into a hotel room Perhaps this place was just too cool for me , Location friendliness of staff
421368,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, The bed is immediate next to the washing room makes a little uncomfortable , The lobby design is so cozy for visitors to grab a view of the cannel street scene 
421369,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel,No Negative, The property is amazing very central to everything in Amsterdam The staff deserve a special mention absolutely wonderful Great memories will definitely recommend and go back again 
421370,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, my only criticism would be that the curtains in the rooms do not quite reach the edge so you get a bit of light coming in , This hotel was superb everything was lovely Make sure you get to the cocktail bar 
421371,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Nothing , Unique and whimsical interior design Staff extremely friendly courteous And helpful They know who you are from the moment you check in Great room service menu and good food quality Loved unique decor video art and Delft colored wallpaper 
421372,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Nothing, The hotel is just amazing beautiful inside comfy rooms an bed good an drinks wonderful best hotel stayed in in Amsterdam an I have stayed in most of the good ones the staff are fantastic an very helpful u can t fault this place in anyway
421373,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, The bathroom arrangement in the rooms was a little surprising , The staff here are SO friendly Nothing was too much trouble for them My boyfriend and I ran the marathon on the Sunday and they were so accommodating with allowing us full use of the spa to shower afterwards The beds are so comfy The service at breakfast was lovely and the breakfast buffet was exceptional 
421374,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, The vibe of the hotel was very modern but not very relaxing , Location was fabulous an easy walk to the museums restaurants etc the decor was um edgy Staff was excellent 
421375,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, The restaurant service was ridiculously slow and the waiters were simply inattentive and had to ask them for the same thing 2 3 times in a row It took me over 20 minutes to get a piece of toast with my meal I ordered a la carte Also I had to ask for my bill at least 3 times I felt like I spent an eternity waiting for everything I also booked a massage in the spa which was really terrible to be honest My friend who also booked a massage said hers was ok but not worth the price Just to give you an idea of how my massage went I arrived and basically was led by a man which I was totally not expecting to do my massage Then I reluctantly still stripped off and was under a very thin white sheet and the first thing this guy says is are you flexible and do you have your period I said no why extremely uncomfortable at this point and he said it had something to do with doing a massage that incorporates stretching Anyway the massage was just not good and completely improvised not at all what I m used to Incredibly disappointed about that I spent my time wishing the massage would end sooner rather than later Also later I asked my friend and she did not get asked the same thing or experience anything at all like my massage , Beautiful big rooms with contemporary design Comfortable beds and complementary hot and cold drinks in room were lovely The bar was also very nice with approachable staff that served unique cocktails The location of the hotel was very close to nice restaurants and bars and not far from transportation 
421376,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Parking expensive , Vanessa made us feel very welcome We were given complimentary Vodka cocktails on arrival as it was Vodka Friday then shown to our stunning garden view room The styling throughout the hotel is is fun smart and funky Take the time to watch some of the video art a number by a favourite artist Pipilotti Rist We ate a delicious meal in the Bluespoon on the first night The bar and restaurant both have a relaxed atmosphere with very attentive staff Non alholic drinks and snacks are complimentary from the mini bar Complimentary Wine Time is from 5 7pm in the library Good selection of arty books in there 
421377,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, The pillows could have been a bit firmer , Everything about this hotel was great and I would definitely stay there again Great position and the staff were very helpful with anything asked of them 
421378,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, The sink was in the middle of the room right next to the bed Our window overlooked the lobby not outside which was pretty disappointing since there was no natural light at all For what we paid I was expecting a little more , Very friendly staff free bicycles the location complimentary snacks and water 
421379,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Would like to be able to turn he A C down slightly lower than 18 5C at night, This was an excellent hotel the design was probably the best we have seen it is perfectly placed for access to all the attractions We are picky travellers they definitely impressed us
421380,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Spa sauna needs cotton wraps not only towels , They provide Extra large umbrellas at the door They don t charge for a cup of coffee or tea when they offer at the bar 
421381,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Pornographic art video playing outside our door 12 hours per day Our grandchildren were horrified as was I Very graphic , Wonderful customer service complimentary drinks and snacks Bikes for guests to use 
421382,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, We arrived at 12 pm at the hotel We had asked for an early check in but they couldn t provide it for us No problem we came back at 4 30 pm check in starts officially at 3 pm but still only 1 of 3 rooms was ready All the luggage had been taken to one of the other rooms which was awaiting final inspection from the manager for cleanliness and that s why we couldn t go to it and although we called reception 2 or 3 times asking for the luggage they kept delaying it We waited for 30 minutes for it In addition our friends who had the 3rd room were being sent from one room to another because nobody knew exactly which was their room So the reception staff is either inexperienced or overworked They smiled all the time though , Fantastic location couldn t have been better on one of the prettier canals in a quiet area Tram station 5 mins walk Most interesting locations within walking distance Overall very comfortable nice lounges great view from the room we had a canal view room Excellent breakfast though very expensive whether you went for the buffet or for the full breakfast 4 EUR for a boiled egg In the end I think the buffet is the best option 
421383,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is absolutely perfect I have stayed in many hotels over the world but this must have been one of the best better said top 5 It starts at checkin and ends at checkout without having noticed a single mistake of staff and if they do you ll forget in a minute by the way they correct it 
421384,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, The stuff wasn t always at their best The room has electricity sockets problems Sometimes TV and coffe maker simple did not work , The bar is amazing as well as the snacks in the bar The cheeses and dried tomatos and ham The Bluespoon martini perfect There is decent gym that lacks push ups bar but orbitrek is perfect 
421385,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, The food and the service in the Bluespoon hotel restaurant need to improve The Spa massage was not impressive , The design of the hotel and room are perfect Everything was well thought out The check in process and one of the staff Hanrik was amazing The BEST I ever encounter in all the years of my traveling We love our stay and will return
421386,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel,No Negative, The room was well appointed though a bit small but not unusual for Europe The highlight of the hotel is the modern decor and attentive and efficient staff 
421387,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, Bath toilet and washbasin scattered around the room Restaurant menu limited Canal view room small No daily use staircase , Free coffee Wine hour 
421388,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, This is quite an expensive hotel but you do get more than you expect especially complimentary drinks quality service and location , The hotel is one of the best we have ever stayed in the hotel and facilities are exceptional along with all their highly trained and motivated staff Everyone were doing their best to make this a memorable occasion which it was The food was also outstanding and the hotel had a fantastic atmosphere in all areas This is the perfect hotel for any special occasion and we will be back 
421389,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, There was one staff at breakfast who wasn t helpful Particularly because we asked about the prices This place can give off a vibe that if one asks for the price then one shouldn t be staying there , The hotel was stylish cool and super comfy It was also in a stunning area 
421390,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht A Hyatt Hotel, The linens have been changed after we asked for At this range hotel daily linen change should be a standard or at least optional , Location is excellent The front office team is one of the best hosting team I have met they are willing and capable of helping out for every need you ask Decoration and atmosphere is very modern yet cozy and chic Breakfast is very rich and delicious You should try every single cake and desert served
