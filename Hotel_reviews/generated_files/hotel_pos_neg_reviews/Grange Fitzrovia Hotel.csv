95356,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Our room was a little on the small side but was very comfortable and well fitted out , The continental breakfast at 10 pp price when checking in was excellent value Staff very helpful and polite 
95357,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, It is the most I have spent to sleep in a pull down bed It was too low on the floor no bedside table cabinet and uncomfortable The bathroom was badly lit , Air conditioning was effective 
95358,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The room through Booking com was described as a triple comfort room however that was not the case The third bed was in essence a campbed so for three women the room was extremely small and cramped , The location was excellent for our needs and for a central London hotel it was very quiet at night even with the windows open I liked the way the duty manager was helpful when we complained about the room description and in fairness it seems it wasn t the hotel s fault but Booking com They offered us a free drink and breakfast on the Sunday which was very much appreciated 
95359,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Tea coffee making no room on tables to utilise this No bedside tables No small side lights only main room lights available that were too bright This was the alternate room we were offered as the previous room was tiny and as we had paid over 350 for the weekend accommodation the alternative room was just as bad with a pull down bed uncomfortable mattress Didn t sleep at all Very poor will not return, Room was small and disappointly under developed We have stayed in much better surroundings for the money No fridge in room tea and coffee making adequate no bedside tables as we were moved to what looked like a make shift room for staff 
95360,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Mini Bar was locked I needed to leave a credit card to allow them to open it it wasn t offered when I checked in I would have been happy to leave credit card details and always do elsewhere Need to get air conditioning it was uncomfortably hot and a bit too noisy with the windows open , Location for Regents Park Food Festival
95361,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Weather was very hot no air con just a useless small fan unbearable in the room mentioned this to staff who did nothing Bar although open had limited choice we were told most things had run out or the beer taps were off Some staff very unhelpful ordered room service an hour later hadn t arrived rang and asked why and was told to come down and get it as they couldn t add it to our bill or accept card payments at the room although we had asked when ordered it When we returned to get our luggage I said I had left a coat in the room the young man said I ll have a look and came back saying someone else was now booked into the room so he couldn t look he would have to ask a colleague what to do He then disappeared away from reception and left us sat there for over 35 minutes I complained to a lady on reception who found the coat in less than 2 minutes but we had missed our train we were booked on and had to catch a later one which cost us more money , Location Clean Cost
95362,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The height of the bath made getting in to use the shower difficult for a fit mid 70s 5ft4ins person There was room for a separate shower with a slightly shorter bath in our particular room ,No Positive
95363,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Nice hotel but no air conditioning in the summer rooms very hot Better for cold weather visits , Great location and comfortable rooms with nice bathrooms 
95364,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Room was very small and bathroom tiny Although not often needed when we were there it was really hot and there was no AC although a fan was provided Breakfast a silly price at 24 each , Price for central London was excellent and location for tube very good
95365,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The size of room it was more like a cheep and cheerful not a superior which is what I booked if I could have found another I would have moved hotels, Position of hotel
95366,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Outdated shabby Start of July 29 C outside inside 30 C No ventilation or air conditioning sleeping like in oven Noisy street to open windows So you have choices why you won t sleep , Nothing
95367,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, No air condition in the rooms and they were boiling hot made for very little sleep , The location was convenient for our training event and the staff were pleasant 
95368,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Not much of a complaint but the hairdryer didn t work , Very pleasantly surprised at how good our room was for the low rate paid We just needed somewhere to crash after a concert in Hyde Park and this was perfect for our needs Fitzrovia is a nice part of London plenty of independent restaurants and cafes nearby 30 minutes walk to Hyde Park and a much shorter walk to the shopping in Oxford Street 
95369,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel,No Negative, While not centrally located and may not be ideal for tourists it was convenient to my meeting venues especially to RIBA which is just two blocks away The Great Portland Tube is just a 6 minute walk from the hotel There is a Sainsbury around the corner and there are a lot of cafes and delis The hotel comes with an A C and a small electric fan which are very useful in the summer 
95370,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, One particular staff member on reception was quite unfriendly and this made a bad first impression However other staff from reception and other areas that we met subsequently were very helpful , The room was clean and very comfortable and had everything we needed 
95371,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Room very hot despite open windows and a fan Awful food room service menu over priced and low quality plus not as advertised Room pictured on booking much bigger better equipped than actual superior room , Comfy bed central location helpful staff very clean great shower 
95372,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, It was one of the hottest days in the summer in London and there was no air flow through the room due to having a very small window I called down to reception and they brought up a jug of iced water but there was no fan in the room and the overnight concierge could not bring a spare one to us so we had a very uncomfortable nights sleep a great shame as providing a simple fan would have made our stay perfect, The room was very clean if not a little small but the location was perfect for what we needed There was parking close by at a NCP underground care park under the Holiday Inn and the location was close to london transport locations and Regents Park
95373,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, It was unfortunate that there was a heatwave in London at the time The first room was in the roof i e Very hot no a c So asked to move to a room with A c This meant a move from a superior room to an executive room which meant more money but got a free upgrade in the end The only difference was the a c and size of bed The a c didn t work properly Got that fixed and all was well the second night The executive room was disappointing in that it was small and dark , The staff are friendly efficient and helpful 
95374,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel,No Negative, Very comfy beds clean quiet room great air con it was a very hot weekend Small but perfectly formed bedroom and bathroom Old fashioned but not shabby we found it charming Staff very helpful particularly the chap in the bar who printed out directions for us 
95375,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Bed was ok but rolled from high in the centre carpet was rather stained no air conditioning no sign of bar staff at 7 15pm but overall 7 5 out of 10, Great location Quiet Attentive reception
95376,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, No air conditioning meant that it was too hot A fan was supplied but it was not much use It was noisy with the windows open and not much air came through them anyway Bathroom was tatty with rust and debris round the side of the bath A bit yucky , The property has character and the staff are helpful 
95377,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel,No Negative, Location walkable from Euston and good access to tube and Palladium Found really good Italian caf for breakfast Seventen o Seven on Warren Street Small but great service and food 
95378,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Booking online saved us half the cost of booking at the reception and that makes no sense , Loved how fancy everything was The bed the bathroom even the elevators 
95379,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, No air conditioning though the windows did open which then made it noisy The internal bathroom became a sauna after one shower The very high bath was difficult dangerous to step over to have a shower , The property is very conveniently located for holidaying in London it is close to the Great Portland Tube station and within walking distance of Regent Street The staff were very friendly and the room cleaners excellent 
95380,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, There arn t many rooms with AC and if it gets hot outside its is very hot in the room However the moment we complained the found us a room with AC, The staff was amazing and helpful Rooms are big and also the bathrooms Location is perfect
95381,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Unfortunately we had completely different expectations when we arrived at the hotel as the information on booking were not accurate But the staff did all their best to make our stay special and enjoyable, The staff was great gentle and kind Any question request or complain we had received an immediate answer and solution Also the breakfast was very good and the location is amazing It is just a few minutes walk from underground regent park and many other London s attractions 
95382,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Poor water pressure in the shower no a c in these older hotels , Hotel is close to Regent s Park short walk to Great Portland underground and not far from St Pancras Clean quiet 
95383,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Room size however larger than many in central London Bathroom could have been cleaner Cannot comment on food as we did have any meals on site , Excellent location 
95384,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Our first room was very small even for London standards , The staff were really friendly and helpful We complained about some noisy guests keeping us awake and they moved us to a different room for our second night with an upgrade My husband also left his phone charger in the first room and they were really helpful in finding it the next day 
95385,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Our room was TINY We had absolutely no room to change and kept getting in each other s way We had to move things out of the way to get to anything Dire Very disappointed Lighting was poor for hair and makeup Noise from the building site next door was loud from first thing in the morning Most definitely not value for the price we were charged Would not recommend for the above reasons ,No Positive
95386,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The room was a little small , The hotel is 3 minutes walk from a subway station and 10 minutes from Oxford Station The hotel and room were clean and nice looking Staff was very attentive and helpful the breakfast was really good too 
95387,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, There was a cigarette smell often in the lifts , The bed was supremely comfy and the maid service excellent The situation of the hotel is brilliant and the staff were all friendly and helpful Thank you 
95388,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Breakfast not provided in a reasonably expensive hotel with the additional cost for even continental breakfast being prohibitively high Also loud building works in the day right outside the room , Lovely room very comfortable bed beautiful bathroom Staff were really pleasant and generally it felt like a very nice place to stay I mainly chose it for the location which is excellent both if you know and don t know London it is very close to tube stations and many landmarks 
95389,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Dated decor with untidy finishes poor layout of room no bedside table or sockets generally a little dull, Good location short walk from tube stop loads of restaurants and takeaways located near
95390,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, There was building work going on right beside our room which made it extremely noisy Staff were not interested when we complained The hotel was not full so we could of been offered a alternative t room,No Positive
95391,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, There was no hot water in the morning for a shower No hooks in the bathroom for hanging up towels The breakfast was expensive for the quality, Very comfortable bed spacious room
95392,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, the lights didnt work in the room so had to call someone to come up straight away , the location but then that s why i booked it because it was 5 minute drive from where i needed to be 
95393,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Bath lovely and large but ifficult to get in and out Cost of breakfast , Quietness I was upgraded which helped Great Portland Street and busses two minutes away very friendly staff and traditional style
95394,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The fold up bed not good at all and there was a radio play all night and the under ground train was under our room was awake most of the night at first i thought it was the laundrette of the hotel and staff had the radio on and it was the washing machine spinning ha but on the second night my friend had found out what it was , It was central fantastic for what we needed 
95395,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was very cute and homie The location was really nice because there was a tube station a short walk away Oxford street was also about a 10 15 minute walk Staff was helpful Would go again 
95396,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The room was a bit warm but that s the only issue , Great location nice staff and clean decent rooms Good selection of shops bars restaurants and tube options all within 5 mins walk so really easy to find and get to and from 
95397,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Checked out at 5 30 am Took 15 mins of calling and phoning the property before I could attract attention of a receptionist who then didn t seem to be able to produce a receipt which is all I needed the room was paid for Result late for my early meeting , Good price
95398,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, It wasn t something in particular that I didn t like would be nice if they would have had a gym But is was an excellent service and hotel, The decorations ambience of the hotel and the staff
95399,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The one issue we had was the stairs leading into the hotel There was no access for our baby carriage and we had to carry it up and down each time , The hotel staff was friendly and the room was cozy Good location
95400,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The room was not four star I can forgive the tired furnishings but the bed which folded up into the wall was very uncomfortable We felt that the low price meant we had been given a sub standard room , The location was quiet yet handy for the tube and walking access to the areas we needed to visit 
95401,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The hotel is tired and old fashioned The floor I was on had an unbearable smell of cigarette smoke in the corridor I spoke to the staff twice to complain nothing was done I was not moved as they were full so I left a day early , Staff extremely friendly and helpful 
95402,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The lift elevator glass had smudges Consider cleaning once a week Breakfast should be included in the price , The double bed was very comfortable Great location Quiet room 
95403,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The TV remote wasn t working but I wasn t too concerned about it I just reported on my way out , The bed is extremely comfy Staff was helpful and polite 
95404,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The rooms were a little hot and stuffy despite the mid winter timing of our stay we had to open the windows to let some very cool air in after waking in the morning , The size of the rooms is very good for a central London hotel and the location plus the period charm makes it an ideal place to stay 
95405,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Hotel too hot rooms smelt a bit odd bath old and difficult to get in and out of with bath edging needed re doing Found receptionist charming but couldn t understand her English Late evening in lounge found lounge cold looking and with no warmth or flare basic Barman charming but we couldn t order any cocktails , Great position in town for theatre and shops Attractive bedrooms 
95406,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The room is clean and ok We had a great discount for this room but the normal price is 300 per night which is really too expansive compare to what you can have , Very nice location in the center of London close to the tube and to every important place in London even by feet 
95407,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The superior double room was very small and the ceiling was sloping so we had to bend and twist to get into bed Also the radiator valve was too stiff to turn on so we had to call for assistance to get it working and the room was still cold even when the radiator was on , The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful and the location in central London is excellent 
95408,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The corridor outside was noisy with the clatter of the doors being opened and closed Why do hotels insist in putting the throw and scatter cushions on the bed they always look soiled and grubby , Ideal location just far enough away from all the noise and bustle of Oxford st All main attractions with 10 15 mins and near all tubes n buses clean and functional room 
95409,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The room was very small there was only one upright chair it would have been better if there had been two easy chairs to relax in although room was perfectly adequate I didn t like that the twin beds had no space between them The kettle tea etc were in a very odd position in the room nowhere near the plug socket or a table , The bed mattresses were VERY comfortable The room was clean tidy and warm There were plenty of soap shampoo sachets etc The position of the room was at the front of the hotel but we were not disturbed by any outside noise the rubble of the underground tube was not disturbing once we had figured out what the noise was 
95410,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Too few plug sockets in the room and none by the bed , The rooms were tastefully decorated beds comfortable and tea coffee facilities welcome Free Wifi was great 
95411,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel,No Negative, Good location of the hotel small but nice and tiny rooms Very enjoyed the stay Would like also to thank the staff and management of Grange Fitzrovia for solving my little problem identifying and founding the important thing I have occasionally left in the room while checking out Thank you very much for help and sorry for being so absent minded
95412,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Our room was on the ground floor with a xmas party right underneath with lots of noise and loud music Not appropriate for a family with 13 and 9 year old children Staff were accommodating and gave us complimentary breakfast as a gesture But quite disappointed after having paid over 200 for the room for just one night ,No Positive
95413,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Basement room where you could hear the Tube underneath until late at night and then early 06 00 next morning Pull out bed which was uncomfortable and rolled into the middle when turning , Location to my meeting venue
95414,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Upon arrival we were greeted and told we were too early to check in which we knew anyway We then didn t check in until 10pm as we were in the City all day We were given a room on the lower level which was below ground Our room was actually situated right next to the kitchen and restaurant which was very noisy at 7am the following morning As we were on the bottom level you could clearly hear the tube trains running underneath throughout the night Our bed was also a PULL OUT BED In a hotel which cost 166 for one night we slept in a PULL OUT BED Overall awful experience for a hotel that we were expecting to be extremely nice , Not a lot to be honest The locations is the best things shame about the hotel itself 
95415,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel,No Negative, Great location Short walk to University College London Close to tube stops Close to the British Museum excellent restaurants and great nightlife Hotel itself has a wonderful charm to it 
95416,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The room was tiny for the price and outdated Very noisy being in the front of the hotel on ground in between reception and the restaurant , The location was convenient for our stay 
95417,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Cost of breakfast far cheaper to eat offsite Oh the hairdryer in the room is quite underpowered , Staff facilities room etc all excellent Location for us is fantastic Christmas tree in the foyer is beautiful 
95418,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Room a little on the snug side but that is the way in London Space is at a real premium , The location in Fitzrovia warm and cozy with amenable helpful staff And the value for money Such a reasonable rate for the location A gem 
95419,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Rooms and lobby area felt somewhat tight but I think that is common for the UK , The location was great great nearby local restaurants and pubs Staff was very nice 
95420,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel,No Negative, The room was a lovely size for two people to share The hotel was lovely and warm close to where we needed to be in the city centre but no noise from the traffic outside 
95421,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The hotel is very warm and there is no air conditioning in the rooms Our room was on the small side but as we were only there for two nights it was bearable but probably not worth the money The bathroom was tiny and in need of refurbishment Breakfast was expensive , This was our second visit to this hotel and once again the staff were extremely helpful This time I was not only a hotel resident but a conference attendee and the staff were extremely helpful and polite at this event too The rooms and communal areas are clean Location is great within easy reach of Regent s park and numerous tube stations The full english breakfast was delicious Our bags were stored from checkout until we collected them before heading home a few hours later 
95422,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Extremely noisy no acoustic isolation price was way overrated for the room no table next to the bed , Room was correct there was a bath staff was friendly 
95423,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The room was on the ground floor and you could hear the underground There was only central lighting in the room and you couldn t use less lighting before you sleep , Free magazines and newspapers free bottle of water 
95424,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The room was too hot for us and although there was a thermostat we couldn t get the temperature to a comfortable level The tube running underneath makes it noisy in the room The room we had was for 3 adults but the third person had to sleep on a camp bed , The hotel was in an ideal position for us as we travelled by train to Euston and walked to the hotel Our room was very nice with a large bathroom and it was spotlessly clean We had one meal in the restaurant which was good and the waitress was extremely friendly and efficient In fact we found all the staff to be helpful and courteous 
95425,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Breakfast was very expensive so didn t have it Very strange room lighting with no logical means of operation Switches turned on random lights at different times , Excellent location Efficient and polite staff 
95426,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, It s close to the underground and you can SEE the glasses moving when the train is passing by Also it s cold still with summer bedding We had a bad night and I got cold , The location is good 
95427,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Bathroom could have been a bit bigger and more modern , This hotel is just great Perfect location 3 min walk from the Great Portland Street Station and about 10 min walk from the Oxford street Best part of the room was the bed we slept extremely well and lining was really nice I would definitely come back We have not tried the breakfast so can t say about that but there are lot of restaurants and coffee shops next to the hotel if you decide to have no breakfast at the hotel 
95428,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Although at ground level and not the basement tubes were easily heard throughout the night , Room was spacious and comfortable bed Ideal location within was walking distance of Oxford Street etc
95429,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, It was noisy outside but this was due to refuse collection and a scaffolding company dismantling scaffolding , Clean and comfortable room excellent bathroom and a great breakfast 
95430,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Receptionist very rude For a 4 star hotel I couldn t believe how she was speaking to us I ve had better service in a f1 Tv so small and far from bed impossible to watch and hidden around a wall so completely impossible for one side of the bed to even see Bed old and I was bitten by something 3 times in the night Firedoor next to room and as the bed was on this side of room we were woken all night with people in the corridor aswell as metro passing underneath ,No Positive
95431,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The noise underground I asked via email not to be located around the between ground as I was scared to hear the underground see previous comments Unfortunately they gave us a room and we could hear the underground from the room I was really disappointed It is really a pity because the room is super nice but for the price we paid hearing the underground every minute is really not normal They should at least verify with the client if it is okay , The location is really nice as it is near lots of attractions and areas The staff is nice and willing to help you would you have requirements The room is super clean The hall of the hotel is beautiful 
95432,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Breakfast not starting till 7 in central London is bonkers We had to leave at 7 15 so didn t have time even to drop in for coffee and toast Shower screen was pretty shaky and didn t look great for a 4 , The beds were very comfy the room was pretty spacious although could have done with a 2nd chair I loved the wooden dash window at the back where you can afford not to be triple glazed 
95433,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, We were instructed to pay our bill on checking in and then had to pay cash when room service ordered , Friendly competent staff apart from check in puzzle Great location excellent value very pleasant room 
95434,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Room is too warm even with windows open and fan Needs air conditioning Bathroom very small , Handy location just 10mins walk to Oxford Street Nice decor Really appreciated the gesture of a bowl of fresh fruit for my husband s birthday 
95435,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Some rooms are very tiny well worth upgrading to an executive room , The room we were given was tiny very hot and no air con just an electric fan however my husband went down to reception to ask if any other rooms available and we were upgraded to an executive room at no extra charge which was much bigger and with air con It was all done without any fuss and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay 
95436,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel,No Negative, We thought this was a real find Very friendly staff great restaurant for dinner and breakfast excellent steak with bernaise sauce on Friday night great location about 5 minutes from Great Portland Street tube very comfortable bed excellent clean bathroom with two sinks and all at a good price especially for central London 
95437,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The room got really hot but the noise in the morning was so loud it woke you up when you opened the windows , Location just 10 minutes from Oxford street tube 5 minutes Staff helpful and really clean 
95438,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Pull down bed uncomfortable pillows kept falling between gap from bed and headboard Lower ground room view of shed and building materials and that was the superior room apparently, room was clean
95439,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, As it was an extremely hot week we had to have the window open and the first night was very noisy in the street, As it was an extremely hot week very grateful for the fan provided Lovely comfortable bed Friendly and helpful staff 
95440,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The public facilities are limited and the bar operates on request So no great atmosphere , Pleasant staff good location with plenty of restaurants close by Room was fine if a little small but in Central London that s to be expected 
95441,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Hot food at breakfast would make a good start and the plates were cold what a shame as apart from the poor service given at the bar everything else was pretty good , Hotel is well situated to central London lots of good restaurants within walking distance the staff were very helpful apart from bar service which was poorly staffed 
95442,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The breakfast poor quality and steep price Some rooms and areas in the hotel should really be refurbished , The size and overall comfort of the room especially for London The well equipped bathroom and the nice toiletries 
95443,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, There was no air conditioning in the room so we had to have the windows open , The room was spacious and clean Nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable 
95444,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Breakfast was a lot more expensive if you booked after check in This sales tactic put me off so we had breakfast elsewhere Also there were no porters by the main entrance to help with our baby pram Must have been their day off since I saw them the following day , Location location location Soft beds ability to reserve a baby cot and leave luggage for the day 
95445,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, We were put in to a basement room and the bed was a pull down bed from the wall The sash windows also rattled during the night Not impressed with the room we stayed in ,No Positive
95446,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Received a rebate offer on breakfast only available at check in time breakfast was discounted from 24 to 15 euros We booked 3 days of breakfast and found the reason for signing us up for multiple days The breakfast was horrible and limited in food choices ,No Positive
95447,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Rooms did not have air conditioning so we were far too hot even with windows open and two fans going all night I guess this is because it is an older property with thick walls felt like the heating was on full blast Some rooms did have air con so if you go in the summer make sure you request it on the booking form we didn t as I don t usually like air con and don t mind the heat but this was unbearable probably great in the winter , Nice traditional hotel with a relaxed feel Very nice staff on Reception We had breakfast at Villandray opposite lovely Hotel was a great location for our event at the BBC Were surprised by how lovely the area was in terms of restaurants friendly pubs etc similar vibe to Covent Garden Dined at Sergios 
95448,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Bed was very low can be quite difficult for oldies to get into and out of Breakfast very expensive so we didn t , Our room was huge Central location easily walkable to central London and right on a tube stop as well Staff friendly and really helpful Really lovely feel to the hotel and really quiet peaceful stay considering the central location 
95449,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel,No Negative, Very impressed with this hotel On my arrival I was dealt with swiftly and to my pleasant surprise I received a complimentary upgrade The room was huge with a massive bed and bathroom Had the best sleep ever I think it s my favourite hotel in London to date Superb 
95450,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, It was a shame that being on the lower ground floor we could hear the tube and there wasn t a great view , The concierge was helpful to hold my luggage before I could check in and the staff very friendly Room was nice with lots of space and lovely en suite 
95451,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The room was hot and there was no air conditioning so you had to open the window which was noisy , Good breakfast selection and attentive waiting staff 
95452,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Really very hot Even with window open the room stayed very hot , Very decent hotel Friendly staff Beautiful lift Bedding lovely sheets were sooo soft Good shower Quiet hotel even staying on the front just on 1st floor it was quiet Woken by delivery trucks but went back to sleep no problem
95453,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, There is absolutely nothing I did not like about this hotel , I would strongly recommend this hotel if you want an easy walk into the west end on a reasonable budget The staff were very nice especially George the consierge The next time I visit London if this hotel is availible I will be staying here 
95454,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location 5 mins walk from tube 15 from Oxford street great pubs and eateries around every corner Staff were friendly and attentive rooms were comfortable and clean All in all a great stay 
95455,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Very hot room No air con I had to sleep with open window so very bad sleep due to the noise outside Very small tv screen and ridicilously expensive breakfast , Nothing much
95456,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, I would say that the hotel was slightly expensive for what you get though I stayed in a basement room and so there was little to no natural light Our bed was extremely comfortable but it did clearly retract into the wall and so the pillows had a tendency to fall down the back of the bed which was less than ideal when trying to sleep Factoring in the fact that breakfast wasn t included in the stay and that the additional charge for breakfast was extortionate we decided to eat elsewhere which was a shame as the restaurant menu looked fairly nice , Location of the hotel was very good Fitzrovia is a lovely area of London and the access to various areas was perfect Staff were very friendly and quite helpful too Television in the room had a variety of channels and the movies service despite having an additional charge was quite nice too 
95457,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, for a 4 star Hotel not good enough Luggage had to be taken out ourselves at night and not taken to room as it was ready Breakfast too expensive , fairly quiet despite room to road on groundfloor Two possible tube stations nearby 
95458,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Our stay at the Fitzrovia was a frustrating one We booked a double room and initially the toilet did not work We called down and the staff instructed us how to fix it and later that evening the toilet was completely broken The next morning we were woken up to construction with no heads up about it We contacted the front desk in the morning regarding the toilet and construction and kindly asked to change rooms They told us to come down and they would sort it out Once we came down we talked to the reception who told us we wouldn t be able to change rooms until at least an hour later this was after the took our room key for the room we had We explained to them that this was all very incovienent as we had literally woken up and headed right downstairs The reception then asked us if we had nothing else to do until our room was ready Honestly this was insulting we are entitled to stay in our hotel room all day if we wanted to We asked about breakfast and the lady told us we could pay 18 We sat in the lobby where we asked for a glass of water which did not come until over an hour later our room was ready The room we changed into was pretty much the same thing We emailed the manager of the hotel regarding this whole ordeal as the service was truly horrible We felt unappreciated unwelcomed and uncomfortable something that should not happen at a four star hotel The hotel manager called our room and then proceeded to apologise and said how she notices we were interested in the breakfast I am actually appalled I did not send an email to get a free breakfast but to ensure this service does not happen to any other guest Very insulting The hotel itself is fine but the service is questionable Will not be coming back , I would like to start off with saying that I had booked with the Fitrovia because I was recommend it and had taken note that is was a four star hotel I had booked a horrible hotel earlier that day and could not even bare to stay so decided to spoil myself with something more luxurious the Fitzrovia 
95459,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Room s main light switch hard to find hence groped around in the dark for a bit Early breakfast requires room service hence extra cost, Great location Small room but comfortable double bed Great price
95460,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, No air con in our room It was stated so we knew about it and we could mange due to the weather wasn t to warm But if you are sensitive about hot cold you should be awere ,No Positive
95461,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, I had a lower ground floor room directly over a railway line of some kind trains were too frequent for a good nights sleep , Room itself nicely furnished
95462,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, We had a triple room booked We were given a fold out bed which was not fit for purpose it was a small fold out bed which was not long enough to accommodate an average height person and once you laid on it your bottom nearly touched the floor I would not accept this at a bed and breakfast never mind a four star hotel it took me an hour and 50 minutes to sort this out which made me miss an event I was due to attend early afternoon I am still chasing them up as I requested a reduction in room rate however they said they needed to speak to booking com on Monday so I would have to pay full rate and they would then consider a refund after speaking to yourselves I asked that the manager call me on Monday to discuss the awful experience and they did not call me I had to call them and they said they are still reviewing and don t know when they can come back to me I insisted I be given a date by which they call me back so they agreed to end of day Wednesday 25th In addition to the bed the room was very tired broken handles on bedside cabinet and stained wall lights as well as air conditioning vents in the ceiling caked with dust I would urge you to inspect this property as it really does not come up to standard It was not stated in the booking com website that the third bed may be a pull out camp bed which is what they are now claiming as of yesterday however when I complained on arrival they said that they were fully booked and that was all they could offer The communal corridors are over heated and feel like a sauna , location 
95463,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Pull out bed Noise of underground service staff making a lot of noise in the morning in their stock cupboard Door stop in on suite underfoot , Staff were really friendly and helpful
95464,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, We did not realise that Breakfast was not included in the discounted price and cost 50 to add 2 x Continental and 2 x Full English Therefore the deal was not quite as gos as we thought , It was a lovely hotel the location is perfect for easy access to lots of central London locations On our first night we dined at the the Vilandry restaurant right opposite the hotel and the food there was excellent 
95465,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Checking in was slow because of computer problems so we were upgraded to an executive room but the bathroom light didn t work there so we had to move again but were back in an ordinary room I think Also the kettle was in a cupboard with a flap down door and in one room it fell on my husband s hand and in the second room it fell on my head a design fault I fancy We mentioned this when we left ,No Positive
95466,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The breakfast and evening meal were expensive and didn t warrant it as they were of average quality But for convenience we paid it , The beds were very comfortable the shower very powerful clean and tidy and overall the room was adequate for what we needed Very convenient for the theatres sight seeing and shopping in Oxford Street Would stay again 
95467,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The bathroom was not great as the bath was very high to get in to have a shower would not be easy for an older person to get in It would be nice to have air con a fan was available , The price was very good and the location fantastic for getting to the London Palladium which we needed The bar was really good and 24hrs the food we had after our night out was very welcome Didn t try breakfast but the sandwich we had at midnight was tasty The hotel was quiet and the sleep was comfortable could just do with some air con as it was a warm evening The staff were lovely and attentive and made the checking in easy and explained about the facilities I would definitely go back again as the hotel was very nice and I enjoyed my stay 
95468,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The first night we were in a ground floor room that obviously doubled as a meeting room and the bed was not good but we changed rooms with no problems , The staff were very helpful and friendly The location is quite a good balance between being in the centre and cost Easy to get to Rooms were good The place had a nice feel 
95469,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Check in starts at 3 pm late but still had to wait 10 min for the staff to find a room available at 5 30 pm End up at the Lower Ground floor where it s impossible to sleep before 1 30 am or after 6 30 am due to the noise and vibrations caused by the tubes passing by every couple of minutes in average Avoid this hotel , Nothing
95470,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Check in was chaotic we were given a room with a non working air con unit and the hotel was very warm Took 45 minutes to get sorted out and we were due to be meeting clients Second room we were given was very small , Location was fine close to tube bars and restaurants
95471,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, We booked a twin superior room and got a double with a camp bed in The room on the ground floor was above the underground so we heard every train go through We did not request a ground floor room Real shame, The location was excellent for our trip to London The hotel was clean 
95472,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel,No Negative, We had a Lovely room on 3rd floor at the front of the hotel the double bed was nice and comfy nice products in bathroom lovely and quiet staff very helpful and pleasant 
95473,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Bath very high off ground I imagine would create a difficulty for an older person or anyone with mobility issues , Staff friendly welcoming and always helpful Lovely breakfast Room comfortable and warm Great location to Tube restaurants and shopping areas 
95474,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The room was incredibly noisy all night I had booked this as part of my parents 30th wedding anniversary weekend I d emailed the hotel 2 or 3 times previous to their arrival to explain why they were staying The hotel assured me they would take extra care of them and make it special They didn t and there was no acknowledgement of their anniversary I would expect more care from a 4 establishment , Good location for Theatre land 
95475,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Breakfast is very expensive and of poor quality They make you pay on the sport you can t put it on your bill In any case you have to pay for your whole stay at check in , My room was comfortable and had a good size the bathroom was nice and well equipped There was a kettle free newspapers and magazines The hotel is close to a few tube stations and a lot of places are only walking distance away 
95476,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The kettle was a little awkward to use in a little cupboard on the wall , Very polite and helpful staff Very comfortable bed Room nice and warm but with good ventilation Excellent lift Excellent location close to tube station 
95477,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Considering this was titled as a Superior Double Room priced at 296 to start with my thoughts were if this is supposed to be a Superior room don t think I d like to stay in a Standard room really didn t feel that it was worth the money luckily I only ended up paying 177 It was a fold out double bed there were old stains on the pillow where the room was situated felt as though I was in the service quarters a very scruffy building at the very back of my room was my view from my window if I have a choice next time I don t think I would stay there again, The staff were lovely very efficient The design of the interior is beautiful The hotel has a relaxed atmosphere The Location is on the same road my son lives one of the reasons I booked this hotel 
95478,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The underground is very close The rooms we were put in were on the lower ground and gently shook every two to three minutes The solution from reception was that the underground stops at midnight This will be a significant issue come August with the night trains starting These appear to be extra rooms with beds that have been pulled down from a wardrobe and generally tired fittings in the bathroom , Good location Served a purpose at a reasonable price They kept our luggage for the day after we checked out for free Very good shower Clean 
95479,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Rooms are incredibly small screen on shower was broken and the actual showerhead leaked from the top which wet the whole bathroom The size of the bathroom was extremely small too and rooms were dark , Location and staff were friendly
95480,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The room was rather gloomy the decor seemed dated instead of period style a little shabby Marks on the carpet draws in the desk didn t fit the cover to the information brochure was ripped This may seem trivial but these details are things which seemed as if it didn t matter to the hotel which makes a guest feel under valued Half an hour before check out on Monday morning the room phone rang checkout was shouted at me I couldn t understand what else was said but this seemed rather officious given I had every intention of checking out on time Things like this need to be finessed , Quiet room which I d requested at the back of the hotel 4th floor The first room I was given was at the front which was opposite building work in the street Comfortable bed Lovely staff particularly Zoe every hotel should have a Zoe She did her best to find me a better room for a second time which wasn t possible in the end but she was great I was also impressed with the barman who served us on the Monday night Didn t get his name but he was really attentive
95481,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Small room noise in the morning from roadworks not hotels fault , I have stayed here before and was very impressed withe the hotel and location Sadly this time the room was much smaller despite an apparent upgrade and very hot even with the windows open Also despite asking for a quiet room I was right outside drilling which started at about 7 30am on a Saturday morning so no sleep after that Staff are great and very helpful and it was very good value for a London hotel Just wish I d had the same huge room as last time and big windows out to the street 
95482,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, It wasn t obvious what breakfast options prices were available The bed was a little too firm for a comfortable lay in The room was slightly cramped for space , The bath was lovely and instant hot water Location is ideal with just a short stroll to Oxford Street for shopping and a selection of lovely restaraunts 
95483,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Noisy room Also had a strange odour Basic and not worth the money Woken by jackhammer early on Saturday am Not told on arrival, Comfortable bed and clean bathroom 
95484,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, it was to hot we slept with the window open and the room was very small, the bed was really comfortable and there was good water pressure in the shower
95485,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, It seems unfair to criticise as the only things we found slightly inconvenient were the construction noises outside and some drunks shouting Both were NOT the hotel s fault , Staff and facilities were great Hotel was perfectly located We had a great time and we would definitely stay here again 
95486,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Check in was a bit painful i woudl describe it as something with no personality no questions such as how are you how was travel or what plans do you have so they can recommonad suggest anything just way below 4 star standard room was on a small side position of tv in room 222 is a bit bizarre over all way below standards, Location
95487,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The first room I was checked into room 7 has a pull down double bed and no bedside lights just very bright overhead room lights This is clearly an old storage room that has been put into service Not acceptable as a room to sleep in when paying over 100 per night Even in London With no breakfast Felt like someone s closet Overlooked airconditioning units and service pipes outside Next room they placed me in was a bit dusty and you could clearly hear the tube line underground near by every 4 6 minutes and the noise from the internal 24 hour bar but I was too tired by that time to care 8am sharp the next morning jackhammers on the next door wall next door building made everything in the room rattle and the noise was unacceptable levels without ear protection I called the manager into the room to experience the sound She admitted that she did not realise it was so bad They honestly should not be allowed to use that room while the construction takes place next door I had work to prepare for a meeting that morning the manager showed me their business centre Which is a closet sized room with one monitor and a printer but was occupied for hours In the main lobby there are couches but with 3 cleaners vacuuming at 8 9am They moved me to a third room that night while I was out at work this was at the other end of the building upstairs it was cold but ok I could hear the jackhammers again at 8am the next morning but they were a manageable sound level although outside bin collections etc were very noisy The hotel is in a lovely old building but it is clear that the owners do not care at all about their guest s comfort There is a lot of internal and external noise and the old rooms have not been properly soundprrofed The bedding carpets curtains are old and dusty The 2 bathrooms that I used had broken shower slides and shower heads that were not very good , Bed was comfortable Linen was average 
95488,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, I would have appreciated bottled water in the room , The staff were very obliging friendly My room was well appointed very clean A good breakfast selection 
95489,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, So disgusting that they didnt change the sheets Should have thought that a 4 star hotel would put on clean sheets especially because we asked for it by hanging the sign on the door please make up the room Even though the hotel wasnt fully booked they gave us a bad room just above the tube so I had trouble sleeping and was woken up early both saturday and sunday Not really what I expected for the Price and a 4 star hotel , Good location 
95490,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Booked a superior twin room but was given a double my son had to sleep on a put me up bed which he didn t find too comfortable, The staff were fabulous incredibly helpful Great location
95491,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Breakfast was very overpriced if you pay on the day so make sure you include it in the room price and pre book , Very friendly staff great location Close to the tube also easy to drive to A few 24hr car parks are minutes walking distance We enjoyed our stay in this beautiful old hotel Clean and comfy too 
95492,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Asked for a quiet room on the booking but was then presented with a syndicate room pull down bed on the ground floor I was moved after complaining to check in which is appreciated ,No Positive
95493,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The hotel charges 24 per person for breakfast which I think is ridiculous We went elsewhere and paid 8 for a very good breakfast , Very clean Nice big bed 
95494,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The room was too hot even with the windows open and the radiators turned off , Friendly and helpful Reception staff Location Atmosphere and style of the hotel 
95495,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Rooms far too hot lack of space in a triple room third bed was a sofa bed so not what i expect when booking a 4 star hotel If you are small in height you may also struggle to get in and out of the bath 15 for breakfast if booked on check in but across the road a beautiful Cafe Villandry Full breakfast for 11 50 and gorgeous atmosphere and service , Location was fine with underground 5 min walk away at Warren St or Portland st station
95496,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The window was open when I arrived on a very cold day and there were cigarette stubs outside on the ledge The room was small but comfy enough although the TV was a bit far away from the bed , Staff very friendly and professional Location and price 
95497,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Small room and the complimentary tea wasn t particularly enjoyable not sure whether the problem was with the tea bags or the kettle limescale Otherwise a good stay , Friendly welcome and calming quiet environment Ironing board and iron in room rather than on request Sky Sports was a bonus to follow the cricket 
95498,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Room a bit small for two travellers with luggage use of WLAN a bit complicated, Excellent location close to tube and Oxford Street friendly staff good room rate for the City
95499,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, small room with very bad soundproofing we were able to hear the conversations happening in the corridor or even in the room next to us we had neighbours very noisy There was no system of air circulation but a small window that could be opened only for a few centimeters breakfast is not worth its price for the same place you can have good quality food outside a fews blocks from the hotel Bread and viennoiserie were dry not many choice There is a heating issue room was cold but corridor very hot should fix that, The location Close to oxford street restaurants and subway 
95500,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Spare bed in each room was terrible outside noise was bad I received a parking ticket when I was told by reception I could Park outside the front of the hotel during a bank holiday 28th December, Well located
95501,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, A little bit warm in room , Beautiful hotel in excellent location Not far to tube or Oxford street for shopping Very friendly staff nothing was too much for them 
95502,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Lousy Wifi and you had to pay 10 pounds a day to get the a fast one The breakfast was not worth the money at all Boring and not very fresh Better to go to a nearby caf there are plenty of really nice ones Cheaper and much better , Perfect situated both in terms of sightseeing and shopping Very friendly staff

95507,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Checked in at just after 9 30am and left bags as room not ready Returned just before 11pm to find our superior twin room was actually a double room in the basement with a roll away bed After speaking with the night staff we had to be transferred to another hotel near St Paul s finally checking in at 11 45pm not impressed with our room being given away after checking in early , Location within walking distance of London Euston
95508,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Being asked at check out to pay for gin we hadn t had with a suggestion that we weren t being honest That spoils what was otherwise a good stay, Room comfort after hectic day exploring London

95521,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, We didn t like the noise in the front of the building for the first six nights of our stay so we asked to be in the back of the building for the four nights at the end and that was much better The lack of air circulation through out the building meant we had to have our windows open all the time , The location is excellent and the staff aimed to please

95527,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, The street was noisy and the room had no air conditioning so had to have window open and some removal works going on outside till way beyond a reasonable hour the bath had a shower panel the whole length which made getting in and out of the bath very difficult no supporting handles to grab hold of TV worked from a digi box which had poor reception , Bed comfy Polite staff easy check in process

95533,Grange Fitzrovia Hotel, Room far too hot even on a moderately warm day Small window locked in position that only allowed a few inches of opening and made the small room feel very claustrophobic as well as hot Electric fan provided and used constantly but fans don t really cool the room comfortably If there is no air conditioning it should not be allowed for hotels to lock windows in a semi closed position This one thing ruined my stay and I would only go back in winter , Friendly staff quiet room comfortable bed
