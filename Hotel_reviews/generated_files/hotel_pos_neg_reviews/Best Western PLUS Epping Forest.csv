319202,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Bed seemed small for a double Room a bit gloomy due to foliage outside Noisy at night not a good nights sleep , Easy check in Friendly staff Reasonably priced food and drink Good choice of breakfast Good location easy to get into Central London 
319203,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, I found the hotel to be understaffed and the staff who were though where very young and in experianced every time i went to work and came back my door cartd never worked on thre occasions I went down to the bar for a refreshing beer but on the first occassion my lager was flat but I never aid anythin the second time I gave up waiting to be served and in the third occasion they had run out of Lager and bitter and it was still only around 8 30 at nite , the location as I was working just 4 miles away
319204,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, The staff took less than 20 minutes to make the bed clean the bathroom and clean the bedroom Impossible The bed had a mattress protector which did not fit correctly therefore it was crinkled underneath the bottom sheet and could not be straightened so uncomfortable all night The lighting was terrible you could not see either in the bedroom or the bathroom so no chance to apply make up correctly We always book with booking com both in England and Spain and this is the first time we have been very disappointed and felt we had to lodge our complaint,No Positive
319205,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Restaurant wait of 45mins for a bowl of pasta Check in staff felt very rushed and dis interested poor room location near corridor doors Breakfast basic Overall not worth the money ,No Positive
319206,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Mattress was not comfortable I d also left on booking notes that I was allergic to down On arrival pillows were down replacements took over an hour to source , Great location close to N Circular ample parking and friendly staff Will stay again 
319207,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, The checking and checkout counter staffs If you meet a bad one is may be ioslated case but if meet terrible staffs than can safely say is the culture of the hotel to treat customers badly My first bad encounter after years of using booking com During checkin the staff can t find any card key to generate my room key so we waited for him to hunt inside outside for spare plastic card finally another female staff took out from counter drawer a big bag of card keys The checkout counter staff attitude is soooooo bad I don t want to mention as I m still on holiday Not worth wasting time to remember bad thing, Nothing
319208,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Facilities in the room were not good There is no main light in the room just 2 bedside lamps and a desk lamp and a forest next to the window so there is no natural light at all very dark gloomy room and a small light above the door that offers little light to the room The shower dribbles out and the shower head cannot be moved from the bottom so would be great if you were 3 ft tall I am 5 5 and had to hold the shower head the whole time I was showering not very convenient at all It can also be perfect temperature one second then freezing scalding hot the next No shower guard so water just went on the floor tiles and was quite dangerous I slipped The bed was a very small double possibly even a 3 4 double and be prepared to feel springs in your mattress The room was very run down and not what I expected from a Best Western The location is not necesarily the hotels fault but being in zone 4 will cost you on the underground especially when you will have to get a taxi drive to the nearest station or walk for 40 mins wouldn t recommend if you re planning on using the tube public transport to get around Felt like it 100 wasn t worth what we paid , The staff were extremely helpful arrived too early for check in but helped us to leave our bags somewhere safe until we could Booked several taxis for us and were always polite 
319209,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, I opted for late check out when I checked in the night before but for some reason this information had not been passed onto the morning team who constantly kept knocking on my door asking me to leave without knowing I had already paid for a latter check out they kept constantly reminding me of the time that I needed to check out with the late check out even though I knew this information already and after a while it got a bit annoying The rooms were far from clean and I would not recommend this place to anyone But good service from the late staff though you re probably better off at a travel lodge , Checked in quite late but the late staff were extremely polite and helpful I couldn t have asked for any more Excellent service 
319210,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, POINT 1 Laundry service was very disappointing along with the nightshift reception staff who did not take care to ensure the laundry was dispatched properly I dropped of my laundry at 05 15am on Sat 08 July at reception I went back on the evening of Tues 11 July 4 days to question why my laundry had not been returned The laundry bag was found on the floor in the reception back office having not been sent out for cleaning I then re submitted my laundry at 05 20am on Wed 12 July The laundry was received on evening of Thur 13 July 48 hours but only through asking at the reception The service directory stated that laundry put into reception before 08 00am would be returned the same day This was a very disappointing service with respect to laundry which caused me some issues because of basically not getting my laundry back for 6 days POINT 2 The deep cleaning of the hotel was poor The condition staining and general appearance of the carpets on the stairs corridors and other public areas was very unclean and obviously not vacuum washed for a long time , The Restaurant Bar staff were very pleasant and helpful The food menu was reasonable and I would say the quality of food served was very good 
319211,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, It was very noisy so I kept getting woken out of my sleep I kept hearing phones ring banging and people talking loudly Although the bed was comfortable it was quite small The car parking spaces were small The entrance to the hotel isn t very clear , The bed was very comfortable and there was air conditioning in the room which was great 
319212,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Breakfast was ok Lots of choice which was great just wasn t as tasty lack flavour , Room was just like the like pictures The staff were really friendly Really easy to get to Our room was really clean too 
319213,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Neatness and staff support with friendliness, With booking com there was a miscommunication however on getting to the hotel the staff on counter at my time of check in was very understandable Appreciate her help 
319214,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Shower pressure was next to none as a lady with long thick hair washing rinsing took a little longer than usual, Beds were massive and super comfortable The staff were wonderful polite very clean 
319215,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, In our room we didn t like to use the shower as it looked broken a bit dirty in one spot so put us off a little On booking we had asked for a twin room When we arrived it was a doable so had to wait whilst they changed it we had driven a 6 hour journey prior to arriving However the staff dealt with it very good , Some great restaurants shops just straight out the hotel turn left and straight down Good place to go for the evening after work 
319216,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Decor drab Beds quite hard Dark room, Convenient for our needs which were that we live nearby and we were having our bathroom refurbished and needed a temporary place to shower sleep etc
319217,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Family rooms are Suited just above a function room in case of party it might be a bit noisy, Staff receptionist and Manager were extremely helpful Very lovely ladies
319218,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, There was a wedding at the hotel and the guests were very noisy all night I could hear them both sides of my room and constantly banging doors and walking up and down the corridor outside my room , I like the location as i have family that live close by and the facilities are good 
319219,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, prefer to be on second floor , Thank you for our stay we thoroughly it and if we stayed againwe do like the second floor again quitish postion for sleep Thank you kind regards Shelagh 
319220,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Some of the wallpaper in the hotel room 147 starting to peel off on wall and under radiator Not that great customer service from the lady that checked us out , Nice clean hotel and rooms 
319221,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Very surprised to find I have been charged 150 for smoking in room as I am a non smoker as of yet after two calls to hotel no reply BEWARE , Price good location great
319222,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Our lock on our bathroom was broke did not bother me and my partner but shouldnt of been broke for paying nearly a 100 for a nights stay , It was a good location to where we went that night and friendly staff on arrival 
319223,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, If you are not able or prepared to drive it is a bit hard to get to by public transport A shuttle to one of the tube stations would be great , Comfortable little hotel size of rooms was good We enjoyed staying there 
319224,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Hotel staff asked me to confirm that I had booked breakfast when this should have been in their systems I also got asked to provide an auto approval for a pizza that my daughter wanted I was willing to using cash or credit card but I found the kitchen and restaurant staff members themselves not professional or respectful enough in their manner The receptionists were average The cleaning staff were very good helpful and respectful The carpet in the corridor is also extremely dirty and even the dining area could do with a proper clean periodically The room itself was Ok although the carpet in the room could also do with a good clean The toilet also needs to be repaired as it takes quite a few attempts to flush it The site was attractive to me because of the onsite parking and the free wifi but the wifi was flaky at best and only worked in some parts of the hotel some of the time ,No Positive
319225,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Not sure why it s a Best Western PLUS didn t seem much different to a typical Premier Inn type hotel in terms of what you get No information available about the local area , It s a quiet location and the beds are comfortable 24 hour reception with friendly receptionists 
319226,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Not much selection at breakfast compared to other hotels I ve stayed in most dissappointed thing no fresh fruit Not enoughseating outside, Lovely quiet room which we had requested very comfortable 
319227,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, My van was broken into 3 4k of tools stolen spoke to the manager who was no help whatsoever Wouldn t give me any information about what was caught in cctv Obviously the police aren t interested Expensive 3 night stay,No Positive
319228,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Communication was very poor prior to our arrival Cleanliness was questionable and staff were rude and unorganised , Location was good we got a room close to the door to allow the dog to go out easily Price was good though you get what you pay for 
319229,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Hotel room was dark and dirty there was a bath in there that must have been left there from the 70 s and some eco head on the shower that made showering a long winded process due to lack of water pressure The Restaurant is merely a collection of tables placed in a corridor and had appalling service this is what I would expect from a cheap and cheerful BnB not a chain hotel charging chain hotel prices Ludicrous, Not Much really the location is convenient and they have onsite parking which is good The food was average 
319230,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Lift fits 2 max with a bag Checking out hadn t made note of extra night deal price and tried to charge 34 more Fish chips should be called Chips chips fish , Good location parking clean very helpful friendly staff best price via booking com 
319231,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Coffee stains on the table and a yellow stain on the quilt cover Shower drain was dirty and the radiator was noisy all night long Won t b staying again ,No Positive
319232,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Took 30 minutes to check in staff were confused then once checked in had somebody walk in because they had also been assigned that room, Good location easy parking
319233,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Staff were not approachable I attended a wedding and should have received discount on two occasions a manager should have called me regarding discount but no call Very disappointed , It was nice and quiet
319234,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, I ordered garlic bread with my meal Bread came out not garlic or if there was some very little I asked the waitress if I could have some garlic in my bread The waitress returned with some new bread Again there was no or incredibly little garlic in the bread I asked for the manager I asked what he thought He said he agreed I m not sure of what teh outcome was however it detracted from a reasonbale meal,No Positive
319235,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, I didn t experience any problems no negatives I had to leave early so I cannot comment on breakfast , The location is pleasant and the car parking is barrier controlled but I would imagine it fills up often Decor is metropolitan to Scandinavian with good links to the Epping Forest environment Staff were welcoming and helpful 
319236,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Restaurant was very basic and bar area was not a comfortable place to be very Spartan Generally the hotel was tired looking and worn , Bed was comfortable Staff were all courteous and friendly but they could use more help 
319237,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, More hangers in the room always an annoyance of mine and more storage space in the room I didn t unpack my case properly as there was nowhere to put my clothes, Very friendly staff nice rooms very clean and decent bathroom
319238,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Receptionist ignored need for wheelchair access room even though it was clearly stated on reservation Had to tell her three times that yes a wheelchair access room was required There was a smell of sewerage coming from shower drain and staff could not locate disinfectant to minimise the smell Wheelchair access ramp was dangerous as it was not compliant with any regulations ,No Positive
319239,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, I would like a refund please The only decent aspect was that the staff were pleasant but they did nothing to control evict the shouty sweaty yobs in the bar in their hi viz outfits and dirty work boots A great Saturday night , Staff nice That s all Avoided breakfast despite having paid Booked luxury double given small shabby twin Offered family room instead but bed was too small for two normal sized adults Bathroom door had bashed in panel grimy seal around shower door I have photos 3 Loud foul mouthed workmen drinking in the bar restaurant ruined the evening All very low grade and not what we d paid for re room booked Over 116 
319240,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Would have benefitted from a lighted sign on road drove past when we saw barriers just looks like offices , Room gave us all we needed for a one night stay
319241,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Can t think of anything we didn t like apart from there was no one on reception when we got back from our evening out, Breakfast was very fresh well laid out
319242,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Heating made a strange ticking noise, Staff were lovely great peaceful location with free parking Room service was lovely Already booked again for next trip
319243,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, I did not appreciate that on arrival I saw a member of staff catch a rat under some wooden ramp over steps to rooms in foyer and stamp on the rats head I was horrified It was brutal and sheer cruelty as he repeatedly stamped on the rat ,No Positive
319244,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, The hotel wifi didnt work on my device , The location in the forest but near london and my famoly tuat I was visiting was great The bed was very comfortable 
319245,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, I stayed there for 2 nights and because they did not give me a do not disturb card to put on the door the cleaners came into my room at 9am and woke me and my partner up and also they came another 3 times and that s when I went to the reception and complained In the night people were shouting in the corridor so I was able to hear everything and the walls are paper thin so you can hear the next door neighbours Never going there again , Can t think of anything to say to be honest
319246,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, The room was awful and should have been taken out of service cracked sink cracked floor tiles toilet didn t flush properly and there was a horrendous tapping noise all night ,No Positive
319247,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, The bathroom looked a little bit tired and ready for a refurb, Room was a decent size and equipped with everything I needed including s couple of busciits
319248,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, We had to wait at reception for a good 10 mins before someone came had to look in the bar to get attention The girl then spoke so fast had to keep saying pardon At breakfast just 1 person poor lady was rushed off her feet Thus breakfast wasn t great I am sure when full staffed it would be better , Room was fair size Nice and clean Comfortable bed Plenty of hot water for bath in clean bathroom Plenty of room in cupboard for bags and clothes good location for london
319249,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Heater was making noise all night long impossible to sleep On arrival I was told that they have no free rooms but they did as I booked online few minutes later ,No Positive
319250,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, We were out quite late most nights so when the maids were going around we were still in our room untill the afternoon which mean we didn t get the room freshened for the 3 nights we were there, Not far from the train station nice big room with everything we needed and nice reception area
319251,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Only stayed one night so can t comment as we didn t use the bar or restaurant, Great for my needs close to where our meeting was Good access for taxi etc
319252,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Fairly hot room so the dong of the radiator cooling down at midnight was noticeable for a long time A bit further to the Tube than I had hoped 20 minutes walk but pleasant enough , Completely quiet location in the edge of Epping Forest good on site parking whilst in town reasonable restaurant on site 
319253,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Cleaners loitering around rooms waiting for guests to check out early so they could go home earlier Very noisy Shouldn t be starting to clean rooms at 8am Check out is 12 noon have respect for guests who enjoy their sleep like me , Food
319254,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Breakfast was very average cooked was not very hot and several menu items not available Reviews were all very different about the time it takes to walk to South Woodford underground station further than anticipated, Hotel served a purpose
319255,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, The first room wasn t warm and the heater wasn t working The second room was a room designed for a person with physical disabilities The sinks were too low and the shower didn t work properly , I liked the price
319256,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Our first room had wet carpets and the room they moved us to had a constant rumbling noise coming from the ceiling but at 2 o clock in the morning we just wanted to sleep and not be moved again , Location
319257,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Had to pay 10 per person for breakfast not cool , The staff are just absolutely amazing the lady at the restaurant is just hilarious Felt bad that I didn t get to leave her a tip as I was paying by card 
319258,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, The shower head could have been more efficient needed a really good descale , The staff were really helpful and printed maps for us to walk to the tube It was good value with a great breakfast choice 
319259,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, NOISY We were put in a room directly over the function room where there was an extremely loud disco going on until 1 am The volume was so high that there was no possibility of sleep After the event was finished we had to listen to all the drunk guests coming back to their rooms Finally when that quietened down at about 2 am we had to endure the clunky plumbing all night that rattled intermittently about every 30 seconds , Location and breakfast
319260,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Very noisy as the room we were allocated seemed to be directly above the function room so music was very loud Bathroom was very cold and it was bit grubby in the shower,No Positive
319261,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, shower was pittyful People from party were smoking and kept going out the fire exit whilst people were coming in and out of the reception made it very cold to sit in the bar , The room was tastfully decorated an the bed was very huge Service was very friendly and I was happy that food was being served late 
319262,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest,No Negative, Was worth the 65 for the night easy access to London by underground station was a 5 cab journey away from hotel not the most amazing hotel in the world but what u want for 65 
319263,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, asked for accessible room given 2nd floor room shower water temp inconsistent annoying dripping noise all night disturbed my sleep No contact from manager despite request to contact me,No Positive
319264,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, It would have been nice to have better water pressure for the shower, This was our first visit to any best western and we not disappointed Staff were friendly and efficient Toby our dog was made to feel very welcome with his own bed next to the radiator a special toy for him and of course a special biscuit treat The room was clean and warm there were plenty of places to walk Toby and the location was perfect for us breakfast choice was plentiful and the staff worked efficiently with a smile both seating us clearing the tables and replenishing food items Not only would I recommend to others we are staying there again in two days time 
319265,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Continental aspect of the breakfast were good But the full English was variable and the sausages that were rather cheap and nasty and to be avoided , Friendly and helpful staff Room well laid out designed and functional and obviously kept clean Restaurant generally served good quality evening food Good parking 
319266,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Your key system repeated failures caused extra journeys to reception to have card re validated The booking system that precipitates double charging for pre booked breakfasts if you are not watchful ,No Positive
319267,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Night staff not so great complaint about the people in the corner of the carport smoking drugs didn t seem to be taken seriously , Daytime staff were excellent very welcoming to the dog she even had a lovely bed waiting for her
319268,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, 1 The bed is very uncomfortable probably the most uncomfortable bed I ve ever experienced for the past few years 2 You can hear the voice from next door very clearly I paid 200 for 2 double rooms and I expect more for this price , Free parking very good shower 
319269,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest,No Negative, Staff were friendly and when there was an issue with our key they were very apologetic and got it sorted quickly Room was clean and comfy with everything needed 
319270,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Pillows , The staff were so friendly felt like home from home Would return purely for welcoming atmosphere Manager friendly and we complimented him on his team
319271,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Bathroom much like a Hostel bathroom in a 20 a night room in Amsterdam Expensive extras staff need training Will not stay there again, Good location for where we wanted to be
319272,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Always out of items on the breakfast menu One morning they had no sausages and I was told it was a 30 minute wait for fresh ones the following morning they had no beans at all completely out The tables were slow to be cleaned and prepared for the next guest I had to find the cleanest table I could find and on three occasions I had to ask for fresh cutlery They put me in a room in the same corridor as a coachload of screaming school kids then I returned on the Monday to find the cleaner had emptied my room and moved everything into a room on the next floor obviously going into my bags in the process as things like my phone charger had been out inside my bag The room they moved me to had an air lock in the radiator and was constantly clicking quite loudly in the dead of the night which interrupted my sleep for the rest of the week At times the car park is difficult to get parked in until the bar empties I doubt I will stay here again this was not a good experience which is disappointing from a best western hotel as they are usually very good , Free wifi was good as the phone signal is very poor The location is nice This could be a very nice hotel but I feel it is quite poorly run and could do with investment as it feels quite dated and a little bit run down 
319273,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, TV remote didn t work and heating could not be operated but not essential for a 4 hour sleep lol, Very clean and nice environment The man that attended to me that night was really helpful And the lady that helped me with check out was very friendly 
319274,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, The room it self looked a bit run down paint etc mouldy in shower by sealant Also no air con heating I d advise you get hooked up to the wifi as of the area you lose signal and will get no coverage so you may miss out on important calls and emails , Location and free parking
319275,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, the bathroom was spotless but a little tired, The staff in this hotel are brilliant they are all so friendly and go the extra mile Comfortable beds and a good brekkie
319276,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Don t accept Amex even though Booking com authorized payment through Amex Very inconvenient given I didn t have an alternative payment method Kettle in the room took ages to boil Loud private function that ran on until 12pm but wasn t informed of this at the time of booking , Late checkout
319277,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, See above, Nothing The worst Best Western I have ever stayed in It was dirty The carpets were dirty and the bathroom was broken Chips to the marble and missing shower screen 
319278,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, All staff we came into contact with were less than customer friendly Although we loved the hotel sadly due to the attitude we experienced we would not return , The room was nicely positioned and we enjoyed watching the birds Beds were very comfy 
319279,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Great polite happy person checked me in person who checked me out bit cold and unfriendly Decor is a bit dated so if you like a modern environment this is not for you , Spacious room lovely comfy bed great en suite bathroom quiet location yet close to transport 
319280,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, I stayed here booked 2 double bedrooms exactly the same The second bedroom was for my parents and they had two single beds pushed together This was surprising comfortable and rather large As for my bed it was hard springs could be felt and it was the smallest double bed I had ever seen I don t see why both rooms were different I have a slipped disc and decided sleeping on the floor was actully more comfortable There was also a wedding on which proved to make parking ridiculous Waited around in the car for 15 mins before deciding I had to block another driving in as I had plans and needed to get ready I was told off for this but there is no other parking on site or near by After going back out again I had the same problem with parking and this was at 23 30 at night I spent a good 30 mins in total trying to find spaces and getting someone to back me on to the grass I was a paying customer and I was told parking was avalible which as explained before proved tough The wedding was rather loud and kept us up for a few hours as people were in the hall ways All in all not a good experience Would appreciate a refund ,No Positive
319281,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Room corridors doors were a bit gloomy and the paint work around this area was very tired Rooms had been partially modernised over time but still show some old tired features Car park could do with a bit of TLC half broken raw brick walls and crashed into exit pin pad on Car Exit 4am precisely there were some sweary guests having a loud corridor conversation not the hotel s fault obviously , The price Very helpful breakfast staff and good variety at breakfast in a comfortable breakfast area Room was quiet and had view of trees Location is in a forested area but there is no pavement to safely walk from the hotel Convenient for driving to access the real Epping Forest 
319282,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest,No Negative, We arrived early and were able to check in with just a 10 minute wait To be fair the hotel was cheap compared to other hotels in the area for which I doubt would be able to offer any more than the Best Western Epping forest Free car park wifi
319283,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, The carpet was pretty grubby and didn t look as if it had been cleaned in a while The room was located next to a wooded area and the windows had been left open so there were lots of insects flying around the room and on the bed which was horrid There was a party going on until the early hours which was really very noisy so could not get to sleep for ages , The bed was pretty comfortable and breakfast was nice enough
319284,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, At 2am there was an enormous amount of banging as someone tried to get into another room This went in for an hour or so with no intervention from the Hotel staff , The bar area and plenty of parking available 
319285,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Was located by the lift on the 2new floor and was kept awake by passers by and the door kept rattling with the draft from theach hall and it sounded like someone was trying to get in the room Might have something to do with it looked likeep someone had tried to kick the door in previously,No Positive
319286,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Very small shower cubicle and a stiff folding door Whilst the hotel has no control over other residents on the Saturday night a group of 20 30yr old males drank outside till 2am and then at 5 45 started shouting to each other along the corridor slamming doors I do believe that when inconsiderate morons are identified they should be put on a black list used by all hotels to prevent others being inconvenienced , It was clean and comfortable 
319287,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, The bed was extremely uncomfortable Very lumpy and springy I had to sleep with my head at the feet end to find a barely comfortable position and woke several times The water pressure of the shower was awful It took 20 minutes to wash and rinse my hair making me late It was a pathetic dribble The receptionist didn t seem too worried and just said Oh Sorry about that , Breakfast was good Nice sausages and poached eggs 
319288,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Not being able to park my vehicle due to the staff filling the car park with unpaying guest s being woken up at 10 30 please and then again at 1 15 an to move my vehicle Avoid at all costs , Nothing
319289,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, It s said 24 hour reception but it wasn t As my partner went out and came back at 3 30 and all the doors were locked also another young couple outside trying to get in So he had to call me And I went to reception to find a note with a contact number on the front desk not on the door Saying to call if need assistance , Amazin king size bed free parking only there for one night cause we had a wedding but really enjoyed it Breakfast was also Amazin 
319290,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, One staff member needed a customer service course everyone else was lovely, Location great for the event we were travelling to Pumpkin ravioli in the restaurant was delicious and breakfast was good although ran out of pastries before everyone had finished no fruit salad despite it being listed on the menu 
319291,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Room did not have a phone This would have been useful for room service , Nice quiet stay except for part of Saturday evening when there was a private function on in the hotel The staff were kind to notify me of this on my arrival but as note to self for future it is a good idea to check on booking if a function is planned during your stay 
319292,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Kept up all night by noise arguing swearing banging on door running up and down coridor Complained to Reception at 2 am but nothing changed Complained again at 4 am Finally got to sleep at almost 5 am Got a full refund , Conveniently located for tube into central London Comfy beds 
319293,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, At check in the booking com reservation for a family room had apparently not made it onto the hotel s system We went up to the room and although it had a double bed and sofa bed the sofa bed had not been prepared Cue a trip back down to reception un necessary and off to a bad start The room was tired with plug sockets hastily covered with electrical tape Saying that we slept well and the bed was fine The following morning s breakfast was unpleasant as the restaurant was not very clean with filthy chairs and unwiped tables The food was of motorway service station standard with undrinkable coffee from a machine if I d paid 50 all of this would have been understandable just but the bill came to 110 including breakfast Ripoff We were glad to leave , Location
319294,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, Priority is given to wedding parties so hotel corridor extremely noisy until around 4am Rooms very cold but no extra blankets, Location One member of staff very helpful
319295,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest,No Negative, Really lovely staff Comfy clean room Bath that filled with lovely hot water really quickly Food great Fantastic relaxing weekend will definitely go back 
319296,Best Western PLUS Epping Forest, No scales at reception to weigh cases before we left for the airport , Affordable place to stay with easy access to central London 15 20 minute walk to South Woodford underground station Central line Staff at the front desk were very friendly helpful
