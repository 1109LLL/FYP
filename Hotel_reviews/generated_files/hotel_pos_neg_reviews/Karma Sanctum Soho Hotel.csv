102123,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, All was fabulous, The staff really went the extra mile for us and the concierge was brilliant He upgraded us and gave us two roll out beds for my daughters and really could not do enough for us 
102124,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, The security guard on Wednesday evening was absolutely awful he was shouting talking way to load until 4 30am We asked several times for the noise to be kept down which he failed to do making our last day in London an exhausting one Totally unacceptable for the price you have to pay to stay in the hotel This is the only thing that will stop me from staying again Showing a little respect to your guests isn t difficult , Great location for us 
102125,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Although we were upgrade all we heard all night was the sound of the water feature from the terrace 24hr bar above us also 20 for 2 drinks is ridiculous even in London Couldn t connect 2 wifi also offer a pleasure pack on your room which we thought was very odd which was missing anyway , The bed was comfy
102126,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, The fact that there was a massive party going on till 3am which we was the room above of After complaining once I was told that it finished at 12 fair enough which then I found out that I was lied to It was horrendous the noise was we was moved at half 1 in the morning after an hour of complaining For then the room was being used by someone else and they had given it up for ours as they was part of the party in the end we got a refund but I think if I had of paid full price 220 a night I wouldn t of got it back , The rooms were lovely
102127,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Felt bit odd and certain things we didn t know before booking may of put us of booking but the story behind hotel is great, Bed really comfy and great location great history
102128,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, No coffee and tea facilities in the room and was told could order coffee free but was asked to pay declined Shame as was desperate for a cup of tea in the morning have stayed in many hotels and this was real no no, We were updated to a junior suite it was gorgeous very clean prices of drinks very dear and mini bar The room was very comfortable clues to theatre we had a fantastic time bath and lighting great
102129,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Size of room and price of drinks, Staff was lovely hotel was pretty cool But room was so tiny and drinks on the terrace were overpriced But overall had a great experience unreal location Will definitely return
102130,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, No tea coffee making facilities in the room lovely looking overhead pin prick lights over the roll top bath shame they didn t work Outside noise from 4 30 am onwards really loud maybe triple glazed Windows are in order, Really quirky and kitschy excellent location helpful staff not sure about 5 star though 
102131,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, It s quite dark around the restaurant and reception immediately inside an automatic opening door Not good on a cold day even people walking on the pavement outside trigger an opening of the main door letting the cold air rush in , Quirky rooms and decor throughout
102132,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Nothing to complain about, Bed was extra comfy Love the roof top terrace pity we stayed in January Location was amazing Staff were super friendly and d cor very tasteful and modern 
102133,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Very Noisy hotel could hear roof top bar in our 3rd third floor room at 12 45 am Changed too second floor then we could hear nightclub over the rd plus people in street shouting and fighting until 3 30am Thats when the the dust carts and cars started Got to sleep 6 30 am Breakfast was included in our stay however we were given a price list and were told if we had a full English then we would have to pay extra for anything else IE fruit cereal pastries or toast ,No Positive
102134,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Shower fitting hard to use and bath and sink took an age to drain TV remote nightmare to use behind glass had to get out of bed to get closer to change channel No water coffee making facility in rooms , Bed was lovely D cor fab Staff friendly polite and relaxed Checked us in early with no fuss or hesitation Hot tub on roof 
102135,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, I would have liked a tea coffee making facility in the room , Excellent location for the West End Very friendly staff even though they were working over Christmas Roof top bar open 24 hours although almost deserted when I was there Comfortable room with large four poster bed Very good free WiFi 
102136,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, The room was extremely hot and stuffy The air conditioning appeared to be broken and the hotel said that there was no one available to fix it nor were we offered another room The temperature was 32C and we couldn t open the windows this lead to us getting hardly any sleep at all Also we were on the 4th floor and there was much noise coming down from the terrace above , Roof top terrace was nice 
102137,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Room wasn t special It smelt of smoke and had a noisy air conditioning unit Rooftop bar was pretty poor You had to pay for even your bottled water supplies in the room , It was a very handy location for what we were doing and where we were going It wasn t busy in the hotel and extremely quiet Staff were polite and friendly 
102138,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Bar shut on the Saturday night due to a private function only knew once arrived the noise they made when packing away the disco from the party unacceptable at 3 00am en suite very tiny , Situation of the hotel is perfect everything close to hand 
102139,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Incredibly noisy from 11pm 6am From shouting in the hallways to pub closing club closing refuse vans motorcycle couriers traffic etc Worst night s sleep ever Hotel staff polite but requests and questions that went unanswered Wouldn t return ,No Positive
102140,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, If like me you prefer a lovely boutique hotel with a bit of personality and character rather than some bland and a little bit boring hotel this is it Friendly quirky and really central so very easy to get around Really small stuff in the overall scheme of things which could be improved and which would take it from great to exceptional would be When phoning down to Reception no response just a recorded answerphone message picked up And when I did leave a message no one got back to me Did book a wakeup call for 8am never happened Wasn t a drastic disaster but could have been if we had onward transport booked Information binder in room needs to be reviewed to make it helpful simple and above all more informative eg single page showing helpful numbers for hotel internal use eg Reception Bar Restaurant Wifi code would help instructions for coffee maker our friends couldn t work out how to use theirs so didn t bother everyone needs coffee could include a map showing hotel location and surrounding attractions and streets would help you max your stay Finally enough coffee pods for the max number of people using the room we got one coffee pod and there were two of us our friends got three coffee pods but didn t use coffee maker as no instructions All very easily solved Having said all of the above we would definitely stay again so I m being picky coz I want to make everyone s stay even better , Staff super helpful and friendly Location great right in the heart of things Immaculately clean Individual and quirky hotel which I loved rather than bland and banal We even got a free upgrade from the lovely helpful and humourous guy on Reception to the Fishbowl Room which had a great little balcony which was just fab thank you and made our stay extra special for my husband s birthday It just showed that little bit of extra effort which was really appreciated by us both 
102141,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, The room size it was tiny The room was so small there was not even enough room for a wardrobe The sink did not drain out and the staff did not come and fix it despite ringing them 12 hours before Only 1 dressing gown and 1 pair of slippers and no safe or mini bar The night doorman was rude when we returned at 00 45 hrs and took ages to get in whilst we stood in the rain , The quirkyness of the hotel and the location 
102142,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Same size room as a hostel 4 times the price Wifi did not work Never stayed anywhere in Europe with a 2 foot bathroom where the shower head was over the toilet HUGE difference from our first 4 days in London at the Park Plaza hotel Same price total 180 night and day of size quality of facility etc , Nice evening front door man when he asked us what we thought of the hotel and we told him we hated our teeny tiny room he apologized and sent us up a glass of champagne for each 
102143,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, The hotel was rated as 5 star on the Booking com website but in my opinion it was not And while there was nothing specific wrong with the hotel and it may well qualify for this rating by some qualification criteria we simply had a different expectation of 5 star on this trip which this hotel did not deliver for us , The location was really superb and within walking distance to all of the areas of London we wanted to see 
102144,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel,No Negative, Sanctum soho is a gorgeous hotel situated in such a fantastic location The staff are so welcoming and ensure that your stay from start to finish is excellent Myself and my mother went for a surprise trip for her 60th and she was over joyed with the hotel and the room we were lucky enough to get upgraded to the 5th floor and WOW what a room We had such a fun and memorable time Will defo recommend and will 100 visit this hotel again Xx
102145,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Next to a bar which was open late so we heard the music till about 3 in the morning, Great staff and we met Mark the owner who was so friendly and made us very welcome 
102146,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, The location was perfect and the staff friendly and helpful The only thing to complain about was that the room was dark and there was no reading light ,No Positive
102147,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Rooms are a little cosy for our liking but well furnished ok if all you need is to put your head down , Restaurant staff were great as was the food which was first class 
102148,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Our room looked great but it was small things such as dirt on the skirting boards Some off the staff where outstaning but there were a couple who just seemed as if they could not be bothered If the table staff were as good as the chef s they would have one of the best restaurants in the city , The hotel has a fantastic off the wall look and feel to it The food served is far superior to any other restaurants we tried including some of the ones owned by famous chefs The reception staff were very nice and they made us feel very welcome The hotel is located just behind regent street and so is in a fantastic location for shopping as my wallet found out 
102149,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Room was very dark Could do with a door man the street was a bit rough and didn t feel that safe walking back to the hotel at night, Bed was very comfy Nice bathroom 
102150,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, No tea n coffee in room sorely missed wouldn t Hurt to give bottled water for guessed no charge, Huge bed lovely room lovely staff helpful as we needed an iron couldn t do enough for us room was good size for a small double
102151,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, No bitter real ale only bottled largers then a service charge for serving them at the bar breakfast was disappointing for the price, Friendly staff rooms were good value for money in comparison to other hotels in that area really like the heavy metal theme that ran through the whole hotel with out it being ott
102152,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, No tea and coffee facilities The downstairs bar and restaurant were closed for a private function , Excellent check in excellent staff very friendly got offered free upgrade to suite on arrival one of the best rooms we ve stayed in London Great bar 
102153,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, room was small and no tea coffee facilities in the room and would have expected that in a 5 star hotel room also smelt of cigarettes even though it was supposed to be non smoking, location was brilliant
102154,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Staff were rude rooms are tiny dated and unclean 5 prices but not 5 service Rooftop bar is certainly not 24hour Soft drinks on the roof were served out of 2l bottles flat and warm as not refrigerated and 5 each No management on site to hear our complaints , Location
102155,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, The noise from the car above was really loud later on Unfortunately when he turned on the air con my brother was victim to another patron smoking something a bit dodgy , Beds were really comfortable We were made very welcome on arrival The location is excellent 
102156,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Staff didn t seem overly professional and were a little slow to respond eg when we ordered tea or asked for help working the frankly quite cryptic electronic blinds The roof terrace wasn t very well organised so somehow doesn t come together as a comfortable location for a drink We didn t get towels replaced on the second day and had to share one between two We didn t have time to wait for reception staff to respond judging by previous experience , Great location close to shops of regent street and Oxford Circus and near great restaurants Comfortable bed
102157,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, An alarm went off in the middle of the night and we had no explanation as to why and the recpeionist was very rushed not his fault be we felt rushed too , I liked the decor and the location alot The bed was amazing so soft Also appreciated the air conditioning
102158,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Staff were awful rooms tiny dated and not satisfactory for a 5 star hotel Rooftop bar serving overpriced warm flat drinks not open 24hours as advertised , Location very good
102159,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, The first room allocated smelt of cigarette smoke We were shown to a different room after complaining but this room was not as nice , Great location and friendly staff 
102160,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel,No Negative, Superb service Cool design and awesome location in SoHo Great vibe and surprisingly quiet rooms taking the location into account Highly recommendable 
102161,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, A little bit to many yourng people partiing at the hotel , The beds are best also a big bathroom The room was good not to small but the wonderful beds are my favorite 
102162,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Water in the shower was lukewarm at its best Extremely loud music from the rooftop bar could be heard in the room until 10pm, Well attained room nicely decorated
102163,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Breakfast arrangements very strange and confusing complicated to say the least which is a shame after a great night, Lovely vibe and boutique feel great decor and very comfy bed 
102164,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Very noisy people on 1st floor that kept running around shouting and banging on doors until 4am Bathroom window wouldn t open broken handle Washbasin wouldn t flush Small room , Good location in City Center 
102165,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Dirty bathroom room very small for superior room fire alarm went off in middle of the night with no explanation or apology from staff, Very comfortable beds and hotel in excellent location
102166,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, nothing to dislike, The hotel was fantastic loved the boutique room which was very big decorated lovely and had everything we needed The Hotel was near to Leicester Square Covent Garden and lots more major attractions fab 
102167,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Shower leaking causing pressure to drop so the bathroom experience was not as it should have been , Loved the roof top bar nice to relax after coming back from a night out being able to have a night cap without the bar closing down Nice touch 
102168,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, No tea making facilities in bedroom We had to order a pot of tea for two from room service at a cost of 7 00 , Fantastic location Very comfortable bed Well stocked minibar 
102169,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, The room was tired and worn and in need of re decorating There were visible stains on the rug and lamp shade For the amount the room costs you would expect it to be equipped items such as a hair dryer or a kettle , the location
102170,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Some staff were rude we arrived and given an average room nothing special would not rate it 5 only 1 bath robe 1 bath towel and no slippers it clearly stated 2 people on the booking Door handle was being fixed later that day Ripped bed linen and no shower cap little things make it 5 Stayed in many 5 hotels and feel it should be more a 4 , We returned to the Sanctum as it was fab a few years ago and like the location of the hotel 
102171,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Cleanliness was poor throughout Terrible customer service and tiny rooms Mold on shower head and walls Sink was in the shower really small bathroom Mold in grout on walls Very dusty around rooms Checked out after first night No chance a 5 star More like 3 star ,No Positive
102172,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Obviously people were smoking in a non smokers room before Mattrasses and pillows were smelly and I felt very uncomfortable Was not able to take a shower standing upright hose was broken and no fixation on my height possible You can feel that investments into this hotel have been made into nice door knobs but not into beds and showers Overall a very very dissapointing stay for me Hope other rooms are better and cleaner It is a never again for me , Location is excellent
102173,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, The price yes I know it s London soho was to much for what was given Plus some damage in the room prior to our stay was a bit of a downer , The style of the place was second to non the bath was amazing as was the entire room 
102174,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Everything was perfect Except for a famous fellow guest behaving like a diva at the rooftop bar well it made us laugh as we had know idea who he was , Everything was great The rooftop bartender serves the best cocktails with a great smile Super recommend 
102175,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, The size of the room for the price No cupboard space ironing facilities But cool and trendy , The location is perfect Hotel is funky and the roof top bar is a good feature 
102176,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Hole in floor outside shower wardrobe soft close door facility didn t work settee s in bar sunken it s supposed to be 5 star rating but no complimentary water on 1st night , Comfy beds enjoyable stay but the hotel needs a little re vamp Tired furnishings 
102177,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Wished there were CDs to play in the machine Will remember to bring our own next time , The 24 hour rooftop bar with a jacuzzi was fantastically decadent We were able to enjoy a party in Soho till 2am without heading off early like Cinderellas with just a short stroll rather than an epic journey ahead of us 
102178,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Room wasn t at all soundproof Heard both my neighbor and noise from the bar on my floor , This is a very sexy rock and roll hotel If you re coming for a good night s sleep maybe not so great but if you re looking for something cool and central it s great 
102179,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, For a 5 star and to pay 400 for the night I would not expect to have a big red wine stain on the carpet next to the bed to have to ask for any other extras such as a vanity set shower cap shoe shine etc I also would not expect to have to pay for mineral water I did mention this at check out and she did waive the charge for the water we drank Apart from the decor there was nothing that made me feel like I was a valued customer staying in a 5 Star establishment , The junior suite had an initial wow factor to the room and the general decor of the hotel was cool The roof top terrace was a good space a complimentary glass of champagne was a nice extra but I had to ask for that as a birthday treat The bed linen was good quality and the mattress and pillows comfy 
102180,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Room service was delivered without cutlery no salt pepper or condiments We had sausage and mash It tasted like airplane food heavily blended mash Grizzle sausages and gravy tasted like granuals reallr not worth the money The room seemed a bit battered lights not working pieces missing from glass it also smelt like someone was partying in there the night before We really wanted it to be amazing but we were quite disappointed and was very expensive so feel let down Best Violetta,No Positive
102181,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Having now stayed in two suites and having barely left the hotel over a few days I could suggest that the room housekeeping does not properly reflect the quality of the hotel , The whole package and the quirkiness of everything coupled with such excellent and friendly service 
102182,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, dirty rooms lube for sale by side of the bed rude staff breakfast was terrible restaurant closed for private party which was right below our room went on until early hours , location was good
102183,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Stickers everywhere saying about non smoking but the room stank of fags Condom selection pack on the side abit tacky House keeping let herself into our room without knocking whilst we was in there makes you wonder what happens when your not there Luckily we didn t have anything of value as it was only 1 nights stay but made me feel uneasy Hotel tried taking payment for the room twice For the price 280 we wouldn t stay again we ve stayed in nicer hotels on NYE, Location
102184,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Room service in room bar drinks very expensive and breakfast not included in price , Front of house excellent room lovely great shower 24hr bar beautiful decor and fantastic location Already recommended 
102185,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, No management at night The fire alarm went off 4 times between 4am and 6am without any action by the hotel Loud music kept me awake until 1 30 so little opportunity to sleep, Good location in the west end Room was attractive and well maintained
102186,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, The hotel is fine but the room was somewhat small and a bit claustrophobic The hotel could probably do with an update or revamp , Great location in walking distance of the West End and Central London shopping Breakfast was good 
102187,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Nobody told me I had to pay 100 when checking in for any extras we may get I don t mind paying it but would of liked to of been told this when booking I got told I would get the money back when I checked out Despite calling the hotel 3 times i still have not had the money back after 3 days Not good customer service , Loved the location 
102188,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, A rather odd invoice make up 5 different service charges for 3 rounds of drinks and 2 meals totaling nearly 20 , Noted mixed reviews on here about the restaurant but we had very good food and good service We also got a free room upgrade Lovely room that we enjoyed Even had a turn down service Great central location Would stay again our second visit 
102189,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel,No Negative, We generally use the Sanctum when we go to London and Ronnie Scott s This time we combined it with my 50th Birthday and from check in to check out the service was as superb as usual 
102190,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Hideous bathroom I wasn t even able to enter it because I felt disgusted It did not even have a proper shower or bathtub Nothing like the picture at all Bathtub was broke on and on top the staff double charged us charged us wrongly even though I double checked with them when I check out Horrible , Location 
102191,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Some parts of room bit shabby needed painting Staff bit too relaxed receptionist ok, Location was superb and cosy feel fun bar on roof Breakfast goods and cosy feel everywhere
102192,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Room and bathroom were shabby looked nothing like what is advertised Stale unpleasant odour in room Loud music noise from the street until 4am despite requesting a quiet room , Convenient location just off Regent Street in walking distance of Picadilly circus 
102193,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel,No Negative, Loads of character to the hotel Perfect location for restaurants bars theatres and shops and well priced considering Decor and Staff were very Rock and Roll but it was all good 
102194,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, The aircom made a load buzzing nonce when it was on and it would get to hot with it off Not the best nights sleep , The location and style of room was brilliant
102195,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, The street noise from the corner bar kept us awake until 4 a m on Friday and Saturday night but the hotel did not make any effort to do anything about it We were very upset about this , The staff members were very helpful and the location was ideal 
102196,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Minor things Got name wrong on TVs welcome No tea making facilities No toast with English breakfast , Decor quality of furnishings in the room Free wif Excellent location
102197,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Wet floor bathroom Very small room for two people with suitcases No tea making facilities No wardrobe , Location closetoRegentSt andtube Theaterdistrict 
102198,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, It is never a 5 star property extremely disappointed room dark and depressing facilities non existent nobody eating in restaurant and few people in bar outdated shabby furniture and no atmosphere, Location
102199,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, I m not sure it was worth 180 for just bed no breakfast nothing special, Extremely comfortable large bed and great black out blinds which needed a little figuring out as they were electric n had no instructions Hotel was a little dark
102200,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Thought it was a little overpriced pillows awful Staff reception a bit flat though helpful , Room very quiet considering central location Very clean and well maintained 
102201,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, The breakfast service the food was good but there was just 1 member of staff a pleasent lady who served cleared away and welcomed We ordered toast as an extra the never arrived , We complained about the noise in our room as it was room 407 directly below bar hot tub We were moved into a suite without question We were given discount on the cost it was all handled well 
102202,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Having said that the gentleman who served us breakfast was delightful a couple of girls who arrived after us were served before us and had actually finished their breakfast before ours arrived As we were taking a train home this was quite annoying as it made our journey stressful losing half an hour to receive our breakfast When the breakfast arrived we had specifically asked for runny eggs they were solid We heard our server ask the chef if they were runny and he was told yes so it was not his fault We would have asked for them to be changed but by this time we had no time to do so , The staff were delightful especially the gentleman who served us breakfast and the girl on reception The room was extremely comfortable but slightly too warm although it was a very hot day for London The situation is excellent tucked away from all the hustle but convenient for everything 
102203,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Cocktails were hit and miss jacuzzi wasn t working Lights in the bath room are either full whack or off no mood lighting, The location is great the breakfast was lovely the room was lovely the staff were friendly
102204,Karma Sanctum Soho Hotel, Hotel is in need of a refurb you can tell the decor was great when first done but needing a freshen up now Roof garden also needing some TLC cigarette burns on couches etc , Great location friendly staff great food and something a bit different from the norm Comfy beds cool vibe
