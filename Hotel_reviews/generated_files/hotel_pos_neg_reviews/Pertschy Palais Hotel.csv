336353,Pertschy Palais Hotel, I might have liked a better access to cold drinks in the hotel when the weather got very hot outside But it was easy to walk to a cafe or to get Gelato , I booked this place because we wanted to be able to walk to the Spanish Riding Academy and museums There is no place closer to the famous Lipizzan stallions than this one I was pleasantly surprised that we were one small block away from the stables so we could easily see the Lipizzaners walking across the street and go on a stable tour If you want to see a performance plan several months to a year in advance We enjoyed seeing the horse drawn carriages driving by the property very often Everything is clean Shops are easy to get to from Gucci and Swarovski crystal to little family shops and tourist shops Museums are an easy walk Its a good idea to start your visit to the city by going on a horse carriage ride the drivers give an excellent overview and it s at a walking pace so you can see The hotel staff was very nice and helpful with getting a car to the airport The breakfast was fantastic and the dining room was lovely The only downside was that we went during a heat wave and the only cooling in the ancient historic building rooms is from a fan so you have to just accept that if you want to be in the heart of old Vienna 
336354,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Room is super warm at night during my stay summer early July We cannot open the window because it open up to a balcony where people can pass by , Very satisfying breakfast super nice coffee good value for money Spacious room excellent location Becareful not to stop your car directly in front of the hotel we unknowingly did and got fined 
336355,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Our bathroom was very small and no tea coffee making facilities in room Room very hot as no air con only a fan Only one bin could have done with two , Staff very helpful good location Beds clean and comfortable 
336356,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The cleanliness should be improved The room was spotless but the common areas were not so clean , Excellent location right in the heart of the city You could easily move around on foot It will take you only few minutes to reach the most popular landmarks Excellent breakfast good and vary selection of cereals bread fruit cheese beverages etc Elegant hotel decoration very nice staff Courtesy coffee available in the lobby Would recommend for short business trips 
336357,Pertschy Palais Hotel, there was no air condition in the room and the weather was so hot in the room thee was just a fan bathroom was so small , Excellent location and good breakfast
336358,Pertschy Palais Hotel, It didn t have a kettle you need to go to the reception room to get some hot water or hot drinks it s kinda inconvinient , The location is perferct Hofburg and Kohlmarkt on the left and Graben on the right 5 mins walk to Stephen platz and underground station Also one reception guy noticed my birthday when I was checking in I checked in three days before my bday and wished me good luck on my birthday The hotel staff also left me a bottle of sparking wine in my room as the birthday present That was very sweet 
336359,Pertschy Palais Hotel,No Negative, The staff was great I fell sick whilst there and Mario who was on Reception at the time was extremely kind and helpful assisting us with a doctor our changed travel arrangements and retaining the same room for an extra night All the previous staff had been also pleasant and efficient and helpful 
336360,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The hotel does not provide the sleepers bath robe and some other staff , The hotel is located in the heart of Vienna and it is very old building but it brings some special atmosphere to staying there The receptionists were very cute always ready to help I can advice to stay there it is really good choice 
336361,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Nothing negative to say I ve stayed here several times when it was the Pension Pertschy With a smart new foyer and lift it is now an excellent hotel , A superbly located hotel in the centre of Vienna Lovely big rooms with every amenity excellent breakfast reliable wifi Highly recommended 
336362,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Parking was a horrific problem The staff were very unhelpful when it came to finding parking in the city When we first pulled up the staff told us that we could not park in front of the hotel as it was only for taxis We rushed like crazy to move and avoid getting a ticket but the staff did not give us clear instructions to the parking garage across town so it took us twenty minutes to find it Then we had to walk back over half a mile to the hotel We later found out we would not have gotten a ticket immediately as it is possible to use the street for loading and unloading if it s late at night or early in the morning It was a case of many hotel staff telling us different things and none of them having enough fluency in English to explain anything to us properly It was a very complicated process finding the room also The building has a courtyard in the center that opens up to the street it was not kept up well either so it was not very secure Our room was in a cluster where you needed a key to get into the cluster of four rooms and then you had to use the same key to unlock the room itself There was only one key for each room and the hotel required you to return the key to the front desk every time you left the hotel This was a very inefficient system that did not seem the most secure either The elevator could not keep up with the amount of people staying there and once you get to your floor there are of course more steps to go up to the actual room so this hotel was far from being disability friendly or even suitcase friendly In terms of the room the bathroom was filthy and could use a full remodeling The fixtures were ancient and rusty and there was dirt mold along the shower The beds were also uncomfortable which should not be the case for such an expensive room Even the coffee machine was broken in the room The only benefit was that the bedding and towels were pretty clean , The breakfast was pretty good with some quaint additions like honey combs and homemade jams The staff at breakfast were also nice The high ceilings in the room were delightful but the rest of the room could have used some work 
336363,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The classic bedroom was small and the shower room tiny The bedroom looked a little tired and required a makeover , The location was ideal right in the heart of the city beside most of the sights visitor attractions we wanted to see The continental breakfast suited us with the bonus of making our own waffles and maple syrup The staff were pleasant and helpful All our requests prior to arrival were met including a room away from the lift Free wifi and access to PC and printer were much appreciated 
336364,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Breakfast was far too expensive coffee was dreadful and when we arrived 9 30 several things had not been re supplied We went out for breakfast thereafter , Nice room sorry there were no instructions to the coffee machine in our room Very central 
336365,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Shower only ran hot When it is 30C outside would be nice to have a cool shower , Having a safe parking area for our bicycles was very useful and convenient
336366,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Needs updating A bit of paint here and there would do wonders The price of the breakfast at 19 euros Excellent breakfasts are available close by in many coffee shops for 8 9 euros Mcdonalds has something which will abort malnutrition for 4 euros if you really want to save the pennies , Excellent location close to almost everything 
336367,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The room was very brown and dull The small balcony which overlooked an overgrown courtyard was dirty and the smell of cigarette smoke from others wafted in We had requested a double bed but had two singles pushed together with separate duvets Breakfast was mediocre and average quality , The location was very central with easy walking to shops restaurants and the Spanish Riding School 
336368,Pertschy Palais Hotel, the bath was a bit high to enter especially to senior citizens , The front desk reception staff was exceptional helpfully The room was clean and quite Location is excellent in the centre of Venice
336369,Pertschy Palais Hotel, I had to use three pillows together as they were all flat the toilet was made for contorsionists as you had to play between the door and the sink to get in I guess bigger rooms are different but mine was small Staff could be more friendly not just to the point , The location is unbeatable Easy to access and in the old city center The building is beautiful and the breakfast room very cosy 
336370,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Single bed room a little small but adequate , Location familiarity with property I have stayed there before but improved also by renovation Best lighting in any hotel room I have had recently could read easily on any chair in room and on bed 
336371,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Staff is inattentive dismissive Directions given were invariably to general to be helpful E g turn left out the door then turn right street not named walk about 100 meters , Location couldn t be more central
336372,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Most mornings around 06 30 to 7 00h it was noisy with loud voices but did not know the source , Food delicious and the young man on duty friday through tuesday is the perfect member of staff so polite and attentive makes a lovely start to the day We will certainly stay there on our next visit
336373,Pertschy Palais Hotel, poor bedside lighting so could only read and relax with the main light on , perfect location off the Graben but quiet side street attractive building and good sized rooms Staff friendly and helpful hotel is a real taste of old vienna good value happy to return
336374,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The property lists public parking available which in a very loose interpretation is true It is actually a 15 to 20 minute walk from the hotel in orchestra hall It is difficult to find and the instructions given by the front desk will bring you to the incorrect location Plan for a good hour to get checked in when parking This property should remove parking from their listed hotel facilities , They stored the luggage in a secure closet so you could see some sights after checkout The breakfast was very good 
336375,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Noisy not clean it looked more like student residence than a hotel really To get the lift you have to go outdoor near a car garage It is very basic and bad value for money I will never go there again , If you want ONLY location then this has good location
336376,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Sorry but the rooms need to be remodeled The room assigned initially was terrible we spoke with the person in charge and gave us a better but nevertheless ugly bathroom the tub with a dangerous design to be in and out and the toilet so close to the sink my husband almost can not fit to sit there , The location of the hotel excellent the lobby is remodeled very well They have excellent 24 hour coffee machine service with all the utensils Very good breakfast with a great variety
336377,Pertschy Palais Hotel,No Negative, This is a perfect location for business or pleasure in the heart of Vienna within walking distance of all the main sights or places you could wish to visit public transport is within easy walking distance The staff are very friendly my room was extremely spacious elegant and clean The breakfast room is very pretty with an excellent choice WIFI is available for free and reliable
336378,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The parking was a nightmare we didn t find the one they suggested Not on site and a good 10 minute walk through the busy city centre with all our luggage The pillows were pathetic we had to put coats and blankets underneath ours , The staff were very friendly and the tea coffee in reception was appreciated Local was perfect 
336379,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Breakfast is good but pricey 19 Euros not 12 as misrepresented on hotel info posted in room no night staff to fix electrical light fixture facade in inner courtyard needs paiting , Spacious room free coffee machine in lobby location friendly and efficient staff 
336380,Pertschy Palais Hotel, A bit confusing old building with rooms accessible from a corridor balcony which can be reached through stairs directly from the street The only window was to this balcony which meant that people were passing by and the heavy curtains had to be on all the time Not really relaxing atmosphere , The room was very comfortable although rather small and the bathroom was recently renovated The breakfast was very good 
336381,Pertschy Palais Hotel, for unexpected reason i had to leave the hotel before my original checked out day i spoke to the guy at the reception and asked him to check out and refund the money and he said that he can not i just did not understand that why i could not refund my money back, i was happy with services of the two ladies at the reception
336382,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The bathroom was clean but a bit in need of a renovation , The hotel is in an excellent position in a quiet street just off the main pedestrian area of the city The room was an older style room but very spacious and comfortable The staff were excellent and accommodated our requests for storage of our luggage The breakfast was varied and plentiful 
336383,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Lukewarm welcome from reception staff on arrival , The location is unbeatable just around the corner from all the must see sights and shops Breakfast was exceptionally good Quirky layout with rooms around a courtyard and accessible only by external lift 
336384,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The wi fi was not great in the room The wi fi in lobby was good , Breakfast was great Location was great Staff was super helpful Coffee tea or hot chocolate available all the time in the lobby was a surprise bonus 
336385,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Room could be warmer when it s just 10 degree no kettle in room but free coffee and tea in reception , croissants waffles and fresh orange juice at breakfast are great others are just so so location is great easy to find 
336386,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Great location pretty room very royal style super friendly staff and located just 3 minutes walk from Hofburg There is hardly a best located hotel in Vienna , The bed was a bit too soft from what I am used to
336387,Pertschy Palais Hotel, I saw previous guests hair on the ceiling from blow drying more hair lying in the bathtub and more cleaning needs to be done behind bathroom door under sink basin There was dust on desk refrigerator was warm too , Breakfast and Staff were great My room was very cute and cozy This was a perfect central location to live on holiday The overall feeling of the Pertschy Palais was great 
336388,Pertschy Palais Hotel, No hotel restaurant It s only a B B Also the pillows in the rooms weren t very comfortable You need about 4 stacked on top of each other for substantial comfort , Amazing location and very helpful and friendly staff 
336389,Pertschy Palais Hotel,No Negative, You can t help but feel transported back in time when staying in a room here The decor is dated and won t be to everyone s liking but even so the beds were comfortable the room was warm and everything was clean 
336390,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Entrance of the room has a window without curtain didn t mind much though Can be cold at night , Spacious and quiet room with high ceiling Sophisticated breakfast Great location 
336391,Pertschy Palais Hotel,No Negative, this was our 3rd time at the Pertschy but I have stayed in other Vienna hotels too in the past The Pertschy is not posh has not the nicest toiletries and the wifi although free works depending on where in the building you are However the Pertschy is Vienna itself and simply lovely in its quirky old viennese style building with its courtyard Also the beds are incredibly comfy with proper very light down duvets as should be in winter The location is amazing and simply could not be better 
336392,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Pillows to flat and for those that don t like duvets too hot in heated rooms there was no alternative as in most European hotels , Great location in the heart of the city Breakfast was very good Very friendly and helpful staff especially in handling lost luggage 
336393,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Wifi not great in my room , Fascinating old building Very warm and cozy in the room Sweet little single room nice bathroom Tasty breakfast with plenty of choice Great coffee and croissant 
336394,Pertschy Palais Hotel, WI FI was not good from my room , Excellent location very short walking distance to the Christmas markets Cathedral and Subway Breakfast was excellent I was allowed to store my luggage free till I returned to Vienna 7 days later despite not staying at the hotel Free tea coffee hot chocolate at reception 
336395,Pertschy Palais Hotel, This was the worst hotel I ve ever encountered in all my years with Booking com Rated 4 it is more like a 2 hostel A relatively nice reception invokes a false sense of security The external lift to the rooms is a portal to what can best be described as a house of horrors in terms of design hygiene and comfort or rather the distinctive lack of all three concepts The actual corridors and rooms leave everything to be desired Filthy carpets on corridors and bedrooms chipped paint and screw holes in walls creased mismatched nylon curtains hanging from the windows like rags Dust everywhere No toiletries in bathroom Tv on table adjacent to beds didn t wait to see if it worked and even if it did one could not see it from either beds or chair Extremely noisy extractor fan in bathroom Creased cover on bedroom chair cheap uncomfortable mattress on beds and furniture table that best belongs on a skip Really awful we checked out and did not even stay for one night The entire building needs a good cleaning and total refurbishment , The only positive thing about this hotel was the location 
336396,Pertschy Palais Hotel,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and helpful and the location of the hotel is right in the centre of the city and a few minute walk away from Stephansplatz We could not have asked for a better location The hotel has really nice character to it Do not expect modern hotel rooms but the old charm was something we really liked about our room 
336397,Pertschy Palais Hotel, It may have just been our room but it could really do with an overhaul in terms of stylings The them of the hotel doesn t really flow from one room to the next and feels like a good interior designer could do with getting their hands on it I think this could really push this hotel to a higher level as this was the only thing that let it down really , The location of the hotel is perfect literally minutes from everything We walked our way to everything and nothing was more than 10 minutes away really The hotel also puts on a great breakfast with a bit of everything to chose from 
336398,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The Viennese ambiance is there but the hotel itself lobby excluded needs a little revamp moquette with faded colors tiny oldish bathroom old window frames that didn t close properly though this didn t affect sleep quality Furthermore in a 4star hotel one would expect to find some toiletry especially if you travel for business and do not want to bring your whole beauty case for one night only a kettle for quick room tea or coffee and other little amenities that would make your stay just perfect To conclude to be a real 4star hotel some adjustments are recommended to happily marry Viennese style and modern comfort , The location is excellent between Hofburg and Graben and the building itself a real nice surprise Everything is at walking distance and public transports nearby Also breakfast is varied and offers lactose free products 
336399,Pertschy Palais Hotel, We found the pillows far too soft and had to wait till the morning after we mentioned it to get a spare pillow as the spares had all been allocated for the day Was not impressed with the attitude of one female member of breakfast staff Prau when the fresh waffle I was cooking got stuck on the griddle pan she was not happy and continued to make negative comments my husband overheard comments by another member of staff that oil should have been put out on the breakfast table to prevent this I found the whole experience distressing and just stuck to cold foods as the toaster was not put out on this morning either , Well located clean comfortable and friendly hotel Good choices at breakfast and the male breakfast waiter was friendly approachable very helpful and polite The reception staff were also very friendly helpful and knowledgeable The hot drinks machine in reception was very appreciated The rooms were spacious clean and well decorated Highly recommended Apart from the one breakfast incident the staff are friendly and most helpful and should be praised for their good work and certainly hope to return one day 
336400,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Wifi in the rooms was very very hit and miss which was something of a disaster for me given I d come for work , staff very friendly and helpful location great 
336401,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Definitely didnt like that the reception and rooms are not related that means if you want cup of tea or you are going to the breakfast you have to go out and get well dressed, Location is good breakfast also but the hotel needs renovation 
336402,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Facilities are old and lack comfort and style The bed is squeaky and rather uncomfortable The hotel has one iron for around 50rooms thus if you need it but someone else has it you are just out of luck Internet was poor , Beautiful old palais in perfect location Rooms are spacious with high ceilings 
336403,Pertschy Palais Hotel, A little bit more old fashioned and wore than I supposed from the photos but it is okay All other features absolutely compensate it , The location is just excellent 2 min walk from Stephanplatz and also from Hofburg The staff is really kind and helpful The gratis hot drinks from the automat in the lobby was a nice surprise And the breakfast is far beyond expectations They provide an unbelievable wide range of food 
336404,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The Internet was very bad Unfortunately it s a fact , It s a very nice hotel We ve spent there a wonderful week Fine location good breakfast and wonderful staff special thanks to Luba 
336405,Pertschy Palais Hotel,No Negative, Room was dirk outlook an internal court and there is a corridor which is just before the windows The parking place is a public parking house one kilometer further 
336406,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Hotel does not have a parking as stated on Booking com We had to park our car by ourself at the city garage which is 15min walk from Hotel Hotel does not have butler who would drive your car to the garage Hotel Explanation was that they don t know what is written on booking com Room are in poor condition Overall this hotel is not 4 star hotel not even close ,No Positive
336407,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The rickety balcony we needed to walk along when coming and going from our room It felt as though it could collapse at any time , We loved the location and the breakfast The night time receptionist was extremely pleasant and helpful 
336408,Pertschy Palais Hotel, No complaints , You can see that it a former quite gracious hotel perfectly located in a quiet street close to the centre of Vienna Nearby are all the facilities you could possibly wish for A visit to Julius Meinl is a must The daily perfomances in St Peters church in the same street are not to be missed It is undergoing renovation I hope to restore it to its former glory Our room was spacious and comfortable Very reasonable value for money We had room 318 overlooking a street with several cafes Horse drawn carriages pass the front door of the hotel every few minutes giving it a charming effect 
336409,Pertschy Palais Hotel, It would have been nicer to have tea and coffee facilities in the room rather than in the lobby , The men on the reception desk was very helpful daytime staff and night time staff My room was really huge Very quiet Perfect location 
336410,Pertschy Palais Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is full of charm and character Comfy beds great service and handy to shops and tour pick up points The Graben is just 3 min walk where you will find great restaurants and shops You will love it 
336411,Pertschy Palais Hotel, it s not a 4 star but a 3 star hotel and doesn t worth money spent old room very tiny bathroom floor carpet furniture should be changed breakfast is poor no climate control but ventilator no sound proof, location is perfect for city exploration room is clean
336412,Pertschy Palais Hotel, no ac no ventilation most rooms face a courtyard w only window opening on a public walkway intermittent wifi had better free breakfast at a EU38 B B in Halstatt , only plus is the location
336413,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Inside courtyard badly needed painting I think they were still working on it The remainder of hotel was older but fine and the price made it an excellent value , Perfect location within an easy walk to many attractions Crystal chandler over bed fit the Vieninese decor perfectly 
336414,Pertschy Palais Hotel, 1 the value of Money 2 the Hotel condition 3 the fact that this 4 star hotel when actually i will give it to 2 stars as maximum 4 i never seen a bathroom this smaller in my life, The breakfast was good the staff was helpful 80 
336415,Pertschy Palais Hotel,No Negative, Great location right in the inner stadt close to all the sights Breakfast was ok could of had more variety Rooms were delightful reminded us of the Grand Budapest Hotel
336416,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The beds were very hard and uncomfortable and the linens were not very soft It was a very difficult hotel to go to if you had a car and the parking was not close and very expensive , They had a very nice breakfast with a good selection
336417,Pertschy Palais Hotel, There was no air conditioning and we happened to stay during a heatwave At least we had a fan which helped , The location of this older style hotel was absolutely superb we could walk to everything we wanted to see The staff were friendly and very helpful The breakfast was excellent varied and of high quality Our bedroom looked over a street if we had been facing the inner courtyard it would probably have been noisier and was very quiet 
336418,Pertschy Palais Hotel, WiFi was quite unreliable on my floor Quite a bit of noise from other guests in the halls , A helpful staff who are great with English and a unique decor Good location for a central stay 
336419,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The price was high and I thought I would have at least a fair quality for the money paid The hotel is rated 4 star and i hardly can give it 2 star well it was at same quality as london B B and maybe less The place was dirty I found traces of cockroaches wings on my room floor and it has only one elevator and there is no parking for the car It was a bad experience I don t recommend anyone to stay there, The only good thing about this hotel is the location
336420,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Minor details but there was a bag of peanuts and biscuits on the tray which appeared to be complimentary but weren t We didn t touch the minibar but were still still charged excessively for a bag of peanuts The room was at the front and was a tad noisy as we had to have the windows open as so hot July Shut was much quieter Would recommend requesting a room other than the front if visiting in the summer , Breakfast was superb with plenty of choice Location perfect Although not necessary the towels and bed linen were changed daily Secure bag storage on checking out Staff very friendly and helpful Character property with a lovely cool courtyard at the rear 
336421,Pertschy Palais Hotel,No Negative, The complimentary breakfast was excellent Access to a complimentary printer was much appreciated And we liked the complimentary pastilles The decor was also charming 
336422,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The water in the shower went cold when many used it in the morning The room was warm in July in spite of the fan , Nice old hotel in the centre of the old town of Vienna Good breakfast and very kind staff that was happy to give advice about where to go in the city Comfortable bed Good cleaning and ok WiFi 
336423,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The decor in the room was faded and the outdoor balcony access was fine in summer but would be cold in winter Wifi was slow at times, The hotel is located right in the heart of Vienna so it s in easy walk of all major sites Our room was very spacious the bed was comfortable and the room was quiet 
336424,Pertschy Palais Hotel, If you have a car finding a car park can be an issue away from the motel , Great location of motel and staff very friendly and went out of their way to assist Excellent breakfast facilities strongly recommended 
336425,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Some of the hotel needs refreshing but that process seems to be in hand We were out of hot water for a night morning Yes there are a few creaks and groans but then it s an old building , Fancy having the Lipizzaners as near neighhh bors Right at the heart of everything 
336426,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Needs a little upgrade and room 319 is certainly not spacious rather small nowhere to put suitcases and access to bed by window difficult, Location is perfect
336427,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Excellent location Excellent breakfast, Assistance of all the staff at reception one group was not feeling well and had help and it all worked out Especially Lyuba
336428,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The public areas in particular were very scruffy and worn out The rooms were just adequate although the desk looked homemade Apart from the room cleaner the staff were brusque and one member of staff pushed me out of the way 3 times during one breakfast sitting , Excellent location good sized rooms and a good breakfast ruined by undrinkable coffee Many people left the coffee or brought in coffee in paper cups 
336429,Pertschy Palais Hotel, No double bed we booked this but was not given also no fan so maybe not given the correct room type, Free coffee computer in reception really easy to get to main attraction
336430,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Wifi worked but was very slow, Really nice traditional hotel bed very comfortable breakfast was great Location was perfect couldn t be more central 
336431,Pertschy Palais Hotel,No Negative, Excellent breakfast and excellent location Staff were very helpful and I could make myself a cup of coffee or tea in the reception area The choice of teas included a fruit tea 
336432,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Only one pillow on the bed , Excellent location Turn right out of the hotel and you are on The Graben which is one of the most famous streets in Vienna s first district in the city centre Turn left and go around the corner to the Hasberg 
336433,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The room was large and spacious but a little tired in appearance although some might describe it as charming and characterful so not really a dislike , The location was ideal for our mainly walking exploration of the inner city The breakfast selection was good plenty of options although it did get a bit hectic 
336434,Pertschy Palais Hotel,No Negative, courtyard secure parking for our bicycles charming single room with very comfy bed and well appointed bathroom although no view from window except courtyard it didn t matter as Vienna is right outside the door Excellent breakfast included in price
336435,Pertschy Palais Hotel, We all got very surprised when we got there The reception was very hot the hallways of the hotel are dirty and shaky The family room was spacious but there was a chandelier on top of the sleeper sofa which didn t seem very sturdy It looked like it could fall on top of my son s head We had to move the sofa but it ended up being extremely uncomfortable My husband and 2 sons had to sleep on the king size bed while I slept on a twin bed No way that is a 4 star hotel , The location is great Very close to Graben and St Stephen s Cathedral Breakfast was fine 
336436,Pertschy Palais Hotel, none, The location was perfect Whenever i book a hotel i always consider location first and foremost Pertschy Palace Hotel turned out to be a great choice as it is centrally located It is in the Inner Ring of Vienna so all the sights are accessible by foot or by tram or by hop on off bus which we did The hotel is around 5 minutes to the Opera where you can find the hop on off bus station The hotel itself is nice with its own Viennese charm Our room was spacious and comfortable and clean The breakfast buffet was great with a wide selection of bread and pastries cheese and cold cuts yoghurt fresh fruits and some hot entrees like scrambled egg bacon and sausage Overall very satisfied 
336437,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The hotel needs renovation badly The carpets are worn out and look grubby The wallpaper in the room was peeling off at the edges The paint on the doors is chipped off in many places Seating in the breakfast room can be very tight I had problems working out how to get sufficient hot water in the shower , Very central location in the old part of town Excellent for sightseeing and shopping Fabulous breakfast with plenty of choice I loved the honeycomb honey Room rates very reasonable

336440,Pertschy Palais Hotel,No Negative, Everything about this place is perfect from the location to the charming rooms to the nice front desk staff We always stay here when we come to Vienna and have never been disappointed 
336441,Pertschy Palais Hotel, I didn t personally like the room decor however the friend I stayed with loved it , Great that there s a coffee machine in the reception area available for guests to use at all times so could get a tea and coffee to have in room before going for breakfast Brilliant location So close by to many city sights We stay at Easter time so had local Easter markets and most shop windows had Easter decorations There were multicoloured hard boiled eggs to buy everywhere 
336442,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Need thicker mattresses Rooms could do with tea coffee facilities in each room Larger bath towels Decor and carpet in need of updating but in keeping with the character of the hotel , Great location Helpful and friendly staff Good breakfast Hotel with character

336444,Pertschy Palais Hotel, Wifi signal is very weak 2nd floor room 203 As a business traveller this is a serious problem , Good breakfast rooms are spacious staff is very nice and helpful building is beautiful great location 
336445,Pertschy Palais Hotel, The Dining Room was shabby and not really big enough The cooked breakfast especially the scrambled egg was not appetising , Nice big room with elegant features Very well located for all attractions in the City Centre Good coffee machine in reception 
336446,Pertschy Palais Hotel,No Negative, The breakfast room is prettily decorated the buffet is very satisfactory and offers a variety of choices hot cold salty sweet fresh fruits The room itself is elegant Staff are helpful
