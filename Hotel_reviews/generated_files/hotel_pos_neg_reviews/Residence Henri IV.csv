205669,Residence Henri IV, The hotel was billed as 4 star it seemed to me to be a solid 3 even with the kitchenette Nothing here to dislike just temper your expectations , Great location for getting around town and seeing the sights Paris has the best Metro in the world but there s plenty to see within easy walking distance of this hotel The staff provided great recommendations for local eateries the wine bar restaurant just down the street would rate a return visit next trip Shopping was varied and interesting ranging from French children s books for our grandchildren at 1 euro each to a finely crafted hat for my wife from a local milliner 
205670,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful Although the family rooms are smallish they are tastefully and stylishly decorated The location is terrific We also liked the option of breakfast in the room Convenient to lots of good restaurants and boulangeries 
205671,Residence Henri IV, having to leave, This stylishly decorated and furnished hotel offers generous rooms for Paris including a tiny but useable kitchenette and well appointed bathrooms of generous proportions Staff are exceptionally helpful Comfort and style rule here It overlooks a small park in an impasse off the Rue Des Ecoles and is delightfully located just out of the tourist area and handy to many great bistrots the Seine and the metro 
205672,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, Very clean quiet Super friendly and helpful statff Many restaurants close by 5 minute walk from Notre Dame 2 minutes from hop on hop off bus route Just lovely 
205673,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, This was an outstanding experience in every way The room was actually larger than I anticipated decorated in quality period original or reproduction decor with a roomy bathroom very tastefully done and two small armoires The location is perfect in the heart of the Latin Quarter set back from a busy street in a charming cul de sac I enjoyed sipping my coffee on the tiny balcony each morning and the lobby is a joy to return to after wandering about Paris The staff went out of its way to be helpful and responsive I would stay here again if I had the good fortune to return to Paris at any time Beware the tiny Parision elevator of course only large enough for two people or one person plus one suitcase and three steps on each floor above 0 from the elevator to the rooms I can t comment on breakfast because I only used my very tiny but completely adequate minibar fridge overstuffed with offerings of wine etc to buy microwave stovetop and sink I was even provided with two settings of plates wine glasses flatware wine opener and a large pot The only insignificant drawbacks were that the door to my room was such a tight fit that I almost needed help opening it and the somewhat shaky outlets are all near the floor so charging devices with my own adapters for European outlets was a challenge The cleaning service was a bit uneven But I didn t really mind any of these drawbacks because the overall advantages were so wonderful 
205674,Residence Henri IV, I can t really think of anything , Everything about our stay was better than we could have hoped This was our first trip to Europe and we did not know what to expect We were delighted at every turn with the Residence Henri IV The staff every one of them went out of their way to make our stay wonderful The location was perfect on a quiet cul de sac in the Latin Quarter It was an easy walk to Notre Dame the Pantheon the Metro cafes restaurants parks etc The weather was a little warm when we were there so it was always nice to return from our walks to an air conditioned room We were on the 5th floor nice view Nice elevator too 
205675,Residence Henri IV, This American missed wash cloths but I never find them in France Next time I will remember to bring my own , The patio was amazing Sat outside morning and night just enjoying the view and the sounds Staff very friendly and helpful Kitchenette ideal for snacks and wine Location the best so close to every thing we wanted to do in two days 
205676,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, The staff were fluent in English and were very eager to help us find local attractions They made arrangements for our ride to the airport with a firstclass driver and van for an uber price The hotel was quaint traditionally decorated and clean The Air conditioning was a life saver We highly recommend Residence Henri IV
205677,Residence Henri IV, Everything was great, This hotel is a gem The location brilliant and it has a warm and friendly environment with exceptionally clean and comfortable rooms Love this hotel have stayed 3 times over 5 years it remains my number one 
205678,Residence Henri IV, WiFi connection wasn t good this time, My favorite hotel in Paris Great rooms staff view location We had a two rooms apartment with a cozy balcony
205679,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, My two daughters and I stayed here for 4 nights The staff was very helpful our room was just perfect Loved having the balcony Neighborhood was full of great shops making it easy to bring dinner home 
205680,Residence Henri IV, No menu of expense of refrigerator contents Refrigerator so packed with wines we were unable to use it without unpacking, Lovely physical surroundings Quiet Day and weekend front desk staff were WONDERFUL
205681,Residence Henri IV, We would have liked a room on a higher floor but needed single beds so that wasn t possible It was still a lovely room though , The hotel was extremely quiet even though it is so central and the desk staff were wonderful 
205682,Residence Henri IV, Fortunately we brought extra phone chargers of course a converter as the sole available outlet was near the floor in the kitchenette I m recommending that they install power strips in the rooms but best to be prepared , Gorgeous historical ambiance with excellent conveniences Perfect location in city centre but on a lovely quiet street Congenial staff very comfortable great breakfast Absolutely our first choice for the next visit 
205683,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, The beds have only down filled comforters no top sheets provided even when we asked for them As a result room was too hot and sleep fitful even when window was open to 50 degree air outside Other than that room was well designed with small sitting area and Pullman kitchen which we used for breakfast and carryout from lovely stores nearby 
205684,Residence Henri IV, Minimalist breakfast maybe on the top side for Paris Could not get the room before 2pm Sometimes had to wait 5 minutes for someone to show up at the reception happened twice The desk in he room is microscopic with lost of useless things on it Too hard to work on it , Large room quite location very good bed clean I have never slept so well in Paris The staff is welcoming In the room there is a large enough safe to store a laptop computer They provide bathrobes Weird mosaic on the wall of the bathroom Henri IV 
205685,Residence Henri IV, not coffee machine despite having a kitchenette kettle instant coffee it s eye wateringly expensive, fab location lots of character and charm while being clean and comfortable staff super helpful
205686,Residence Henri IV, We had a scent in our room that my wife struggled with a bit May have come from air freshener , Property is in a great location very close to Notre Dame and lots of fun restaurants and shops Hotel decor is great Room we stayed in was spacious and very nice 
205687,Residence Henri IV, No complaints , The location was wonderful the staff very helpful and the atmosphere was ideal if you are looking for a charming character filled experience 
205688,Residence Henri IV, Taking into account the location and overall comfort I found it a bit too expensive, Very nice small Hotel with nice classic rooms The room was very nice including a small kitchen that would be usefull for a longer stay 
205689,Residence Henri IV, The last night we had to take 2 separate rooms on different floors so we had to let one parent go with 1 kid each since there were not 2 rooms available next to each other , Personal attention was great Staff helped us book airport transfer and told us about flat fare via Paris Taxi to airport and back 
205690,Residence Henri IV, The elevator was a little tight but have to admit it is an old building with I guess the elevator that fits on it , The room was very clean and the bathroom spacious 
205691,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, The staff as ridiculously friendly and welcoming Just what we needed to start our two day stay in Paris after a week in lovely Spain The room was tight but we had the top floor and appreciated the doors opening on the balconies Fabulous location And they even emailed me when I forgot my favorite pair of jeans Am overjoyed and beyond service 
205692,Residence Henri IV, Nothing they ve turned hospitality into an art here , This hotel was perfect The place is ideally located in the heart of historic Paris yet secluded enough from the main streets to feel quiet and cosy Our room was gorgeous large by European standards with a big comfortable bed roomy bathroom two lovely balconies and a kitchenette that had everything we needed for a couple meals in the room I loved the unique touches to the decor that felt both elegant but homey The breakfast was delicious held in a cute little room and hosted by an excellent and friendly server Perhaps the best part of this wonderful hotel is the staff They are kind courteous and go the extra mile They remembered our names and room number offered terrific restaurant recommendations and helped with transportation questions When my husband unfortunately came down with a bad fever and cough we asked for assistance in finding a doctor Not only did they get us help but they made an appointment for us with an physician right down the street that got him back to normal I ve stayed in a lot of cities in Europe but this may be the best hotel I ve found yet It exceeded expectations at every level I wish we never had to leave 
205693,Residence Henri IV, Not really a negative breakfast was of good quality and perfectly tasty and filling but with limited choice compared to larger hotels Additional choice WAS available at a surcharge , The room More like a tiny flat with separate bedroom and living room kitchenette and luxurious bathroom Quiet and very comfortable Great staff Location just a short walk from Notre Dame with RER B to CDG airport and RER C running along the river for convenient stops to Eiffel Tower and Versailles 
205694,Residence Henri IV, The loo was supposed to clean and dry you but it didn t work The sink plug was faulty and difficult to operate , Location the kitchenette the friendly and extremely helpful staff Considering the location it was very quiet There was a small balcony which I couldn t use because of the weather but would be a great feature on sunny days warm evenings it overlooked a small park 
205695,Residence Henri IV, Wifi was free but not very strong Had a number of times when the devices just spun This is not a distraction though The majority of the time it was fine , Beautiful hotel well appointed with classy furniture and very modern bathroom Plenty of hot water Perfect location close to Pantheon and Notre Dame 
205696,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, Staff so friendly and kind especially when we left a bag in a taxi they went above and beyond to help us The beds incredibly comfortable The decor Location Quietness
205697,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, We loved this boutique hotel tucked in a little side street yet so close to everything The 2 rooms with a little kitchenette was the reason I picked this hotel for our 5 days stay in Paris We loved the decor and the whole feel of this place Staff was very polite and helpful Can definitely recommend 
205698,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, Great place to stay in Paris to visit all the landmarks Staff were fantastic and the bed was very comfortable The parking was recommended by the staff and worked out relatively cheap for Paris Loved the kitchenette as it gave us the freedom for to eat in out
205699,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, Beautyful carefully restored rooms in an old very atmospheric building Right in the middle of the Quartier Latin only a few minutes walk to the Notre Dame and the Seine Very friendly staff got us upgraded to a gorgeous suite Lovely breakfast downstairs 
205700,Residence Henri IV, I thought I d booked a room with a balcony but those are only in suites Book well in advance to get this luxury , Multi lingual staff were awesome Bed really comfortable and room a nice size The hotel is located near Metro lines and is quiet Breakfast is good and generous The most interesting thing was the high tech toiltet with remote control Also liked that they provided bath salts to soak after a long day of walking 
205701,Residence Henri IV, Warning the pictures can be deceiving Not all of the rooms look as fabulous as depicted on the website When we arrived we were directed to a room that was downright gross stains on the carpet and chairs run down water stains on the walls and ceiling and smelly When we complained we were directed to another room that looked like it was recently remodeled It was better than the first room and overall it was OK but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth I did not expect this type of experience for the amount of money that we paid They have a key policy that was strange to me You had to turn in your key each time you left the hotel and had to pick it up when you came back This made me feel uneasy as not every desk clerk asked me our name when i asked for our room number key This means anyone could just walk in and get a room key , The hotel is in a great location and overall it s not horrible but it s not great either The staff was friendly and once we got into our remodeled room we noticed that the fixtures in the bathroom were higher end namely the toilet with a built in bidet and dryer LOL The wifi also worked well 
205702,Residence Henri IV, Mosquitoes, The hotel is only a few minutes waking to St Michel RER direct to CDG airport The quality of the interiors is very good Wifi was reansonable and free The front counter staff help me book a table for dinner at a nearby restaurant 
205703,Residence Henri IV, Sunday morning breakfast out of eggs In France no omelet Hopefully won t happen again as we would eagerly stay there again , Wonderful hotel close to Notre Dame rooms clean very nice with private bath 
205704,Residence Henri IV, Only one negative please check your remote controls the batteries were almost flat , Friendly staff very clean hotel and good fresh food We appreciated the overall experience and we will recommend your hotel to our friends Special thanks to Xavier who impressed us with his skills 
205705,Residence Henri IV, Breakfast room was a bit hidden away downstairs We went out for breakfast as it was a lovely day , The location on the Left Bank was great Only a short walk to the Sorbonne Notre Dame lots of restaurants the Left Bank sights and metro stations The room was modest in size but very well appointed especially the recently renovated bathroom The staff were pleasant and very helpful including advice about restaurants 
205706,Residence Henri IV, The lobby is very beautiful but small It s only suitable for one couple at a time I did have tea there I wish our room had a terrace but it was so beautiful I didn t care That s why Paris is there , Location ac kitchenette skylight king size bed in Paris beautiful linens was on sale
205707,Residence Henri IV, A little bit of instruction on the way the light switches and air conditioning worked would have been helpful , We loved the charm of this hotel Plus the desk staff went out of their way to help us with directions restaurant suggestions etc we did not use the breakfast service 
205708,Residence Henri IV, Nothing we can think of , Professional and personable service Beautiful interiors but the best was the location quiet in walking distance to everything we wanted 
205709,Residence Henri IV, When we came at 14 30 that is 30 minutes after the check in start time it turned out our room was not ready yet It was resolved in 15 minutes , Good selection for the breakfast Nice hotel with a style Very friendly staff There is a small kitchen annex in the room with a small fridge very useful for a family with a small child 
205710,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, Lovely small hotel The room was beautiful 4 poster bed was so comfortable the bathroom was very clean and nicely decorated and we had a fridge microwave tea coffee area The staff were very friendly and we loved the latin quarter area beautiful 
205711,Residence Henri IV, Room was a little cozy but that is typical of Pairs Really loved it , Perfect location on a quiet little dead end but walking distance to everything Beautiful little balcony for a glass of wine and some bread and cheese at the end of a long day of walking Nice bathroom and cute decor 
205712,Residence Henri IV, ITS A PARIS HOTEL SO THE BREAKFAST AREA WAS A TAD SMALL BUT NO PROBLEM ENGLISH TEA WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT , BEDS WERE VERY COMFY ROOM WAS GOOD
205713,Residence Henri IV, Nothing , This hotel s staff are excellent They were very kind and always helped us We lost our baggage because of the trouble in the airport then we asked this hotels reception and they contact with the airport so many times Moreover one of the reception gave us delicious champagne when we finally got our baggage It was one of the best memories of the travel in Paris The rooms are also quite well it is not only clean but also kind of classic style So you can feel like living in Paris in the olden days That was so nice One more point which especially good was breakfast You can ask them to prepare your breakfast when needed It was delicious and convenient If there is opportunity that we visit Paris again we definitely want to stay in this hotel again 
205714,Residence Henri IV, No safe in the room , Beautiful room quiet position The bathroom was wonderful The person at reception was always helpful There were lots of cafes nearby the metro was close as well 
205715,Residence Henri IV, The breakfast was not our favorite because it was downstairs with no windows The breakfast offerings were simple but very good coffee , The hotel was lovely and well located Tucked away with a small reception and tiny elevator and we loved it 
205716,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, The location and staff were excellent I liked that the bathroom was updated The bed was comfy too I loved opening the french doors to our little French balcony in the morning before walking down the street to get a coffee 
205717,Residence Henri IV, breakfast room and lower floor hallway has an unpleasant odor mold perhaps We had no issue in our room with this however , Terrific location and spacious for our family with 2 rooms kitchenette Two small balconies Modern bright clean bathroom with window 
205718,Residence Henri IV, There is nothing we did not like We have already recommended this hotel to a friend , We loved the classic French hotel a great location front desk staff the cleanliness and overall feel of the place 
205719,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, Great location Quiet street yet walking distance to Notre Dame Louvre lots of bistros around the corner metro closeby and in the heart of old Paris Staff was great Hotel room was full of character very functional and very comfortable bed Nice to have a frig coffee maker Would definitely stay again 
205720,Residence Henri IV, everythimg was perfect , The location of this hotel is fantastic with easy access to bus and metro services which take you to the main attractions Louve Eiffel Tower The reception staff cleaners and chefs were all welcoming friendly and extremely helpful They went out of their way to ensure our stay was pleasant Breakfast was fresh and there were good options to choose from We loved our stay and will go back and use this hotel It s clean comfortable and the service was excellent 
205721,Residence Henri IV, Bed was comfy but mattress a bit too soft for me A bit more tea coffee a wee cafeti re would ve really made the room amazing Bread with breakfast wasn t that fresh coffee wasn t that good but loads of nice cafes nearby for brekky It s a small boutique hotel so no bar or other facilities you might get in a bigger hotel but so close to cafes bars restaurants parks gardens that we really didn t need want anything else, Fabulous location I m not the sort of person who says fabulous in everyday life Attractive property Friendly staff Price seemed reasonable in comparison to others we saw online especially given the location Clean Our room had a small kitchenette 
205722,Residence Henri IV, It was most unfortunate that the first member of staff we met wasn t very welcoming though everyone else proved very friendly and helpful The small kitchenette was useful but poorly equipped by way of plates and cutlery It would have been nice to have been given the choice of a room with full balcony, Wonderful area so close to Notre Dame yet away from the tourist throng in a working and residential Paris community The mini bar was stocked with regional wine at very reasonable prices The comfortable bed was complimented by the period decor Great shower and bags of hot water always available 
205723,Residence Henri IV, It would be great if they had some type of outdoor terrace or patio for guests , This is the third time I have stayed here and I love the place The staff is excellent and the rooms are very comfortable luxurious and clean 
205724,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, The location was perfect A short walk to the metro and the neighborhood was lovely The room was small but luxurious The staff was helpful and friendly as well as spoke English We will return 
205725,Residence Henri IV, No in house bar restaurant but there are local places A proper coffee maker rather than instant would have been good , Nice comfortable small hotel 
205726,Residence Henri IV, There was an elevator but still a couple steps to maneuver It wasn t an issue for us but it may be for some travelers , The location is wonderful We walked to almost everything Access to transportation is also close The property is on a street with dead end so it seemed a little quieter as well and we had the windows open There were two rooms plus a kitchenette and large bathroom so we had plenty of room for family of four 
205727,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, My second stay at this comfortable and hospitable residence Felt like coming back home Very professional and welcoming staff Will be definitely back 
205728,Residence Henri IV, The breakfast room is in the basement Would not recommend it But does not matter being in the middle of Paris there is breakfast everywhere , The rooms are amazing We enjoyed that we had two very big connected bedrooms Perfect for couples with one or two toddlers Nice balcony 
205729,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, The bed was super comfy our little balcony was beautiful the location was perfect for us A perfect hotel for a romantic weekend away for my partners 30th birthday 
205730,Residence Henri IV, There was no good reading lights to read in bed The basement breakfast room was not that appealing so I went to a fabulous bakery for my petit dejeuner , My room was lively and comfortable If the weather was nicer I would have spent more time on my balcony The staff was very helpful Location was fabulous Close to Metro and Buses and great little restaurants 
205731,Residence Henri IV, One night the attendant didn t know how to order pizza lol a little more room service would have been great for nights we were too tired to eat out , Everything such a cozy and welcoming place 
205732,Residence Henri IV, Nothing , I have stayed here twice and I have one more booking in the middle of April 2016 My favorite hotel in Paris for that price at the moment in the heart of Sorbonne few steps from Boulevard Saint Germaine very friendly and helpful staff very clean and comfortable Really good value for money 
205733,Residence Henri IV, Nothing really , Lovely boutique hotel in a quite area only 10 minutes from Notre Dame We had two rooms one with a sofa bed and a small kitchenette The rooms are decorated in a traditional style The bathroom was clean and modern Everything was extremely comfortable and there was plenty of room for 2 adults and 2 children We had breakfast in the hotel one morning and it was good value at 8 per person pastries and bread fresh fruit cereals fresh juice and coffee Lovely restaurants and cafes close by We couldn t have wished for anything else 
205734,Residence Henri IV, Perfect for us , Loved the room our bed our balcony All so beautifully old style French We didn t have breakfast as we eat out late and do not like to be up early We tend to start our day with brunch 
205735,Residence Henri IV, all was GREAT but just needed coffee whitener in the room , The shower the beds the location the staff It is a very cosy hotel with a PERFECT location Thanks to Qiasar Xavier and Riyadh for their smiling faces thet are very kind and sincere It is really a very clean hotel The decoration is charming The size of the room is good enough But the shower It is really like a therapy after a long day of walk in Paris Thanks to Residence Henri 4 for their hospitality Do not search any other hotel 
205736,Residence Henri IV, As I was with a person with reduced mobility The negative points concern accessibility the bathtube is very high difficult for a disabled person to enter and leave by itself the breakfast was in the basement not accessible with the elevator the 3 steps just outside the elevators that give access to the rooms required some care the room is a little bit dark Wifi unstable access is hard few buses far from metro stations , Small charming cozy hotel Super friendly staff The tips for the restaurants they gave us were perfect The small kitchen in the room with everything necessary for a quick meal Cleaning the bathroom shined Location close to Pantheon St Germain St Michel 
205737,Residence Henri IV, The location was sketchy at night and I didn t feel safe walking alone Woke up every morning with severe back pain due to the mattress , The staff was very helpful and willing to upgrade us for part of the stay There was a grocery and bakery real close making it super easy to grab quick breakfast and late night snack 
205738,Residence Henri IV, I couldn t find fault with my experience , The location within walking distance to Notre Dame a block from several Metro stations and right in the Latin Quarter was an excellent base for seeing Paris The hotel was well appointed clean and very comfortable There was even a small lift for getting bags up the stairs thank goodness I ll definitely stay here again 
205739,Residence Henri IV, Nothing special towels could be softer and TV screen bigger in my room it was 20 22 monitor , Fantastic location in the heart of my favorit area of Paris Sorbonne very friendly and helpful staff the hotel and room is small but it is typical for Paris it was clean and quiet with all necessary equipments hair dryer safe box bath accessories etc really good value for money 
205740,Residence Henri IV, Very few electrical outlets Somewhat bizzare light switch arrangement system Slightly cramped space around bed , Lovely staff Quiet location yet easy walk to places of interest Bed linens sleeping experience was first rate Plumbing was new and all worked great 
205741,Residence Henri IV, May be a trifle small for a family but it suited us just fine , Lovely boutique hotel with lots of charm yet clean quiet and comfortable with helpful staff and just a stroll to Notre Dame 
205742,Residence Henri IV, We travel a lot and we understand that marketing means to post proffesional pictures from the best room with flowers and so on but what you get is sky high different If you expect a luxury hotel as it is advertised you will be very disappointed For example the fabulous breakfast area has 4 tiny tables in a 7 8 square meters , It has a good central location but definitely it is not a fabulous superb or excellent hotel It is not such bad but we get an attic room with no fireplace no painted ceiling no canopy bed as it is advertised Just a regular very small room 
205743,Residence Henri IV, the room was a bit too cold for my taste especially in bathroom you could feel the cold floor, breakfast was very good and was delivered to room room very spacious comparing with Paris hotels location excellent close to metro stations very helpful staff quiet location good for business trips when good sleep is very important factor
205744,Residence Henri IV, The room was significantly smaller than we thought it was based on photos, Staff were very helpful great location room was clean and bed was comfortsble

205749,Residence Henri IV, it is expensive Fruit at breakfast not great but rest good , location was great Breakfast was very good fresh pastries etc 3 adults stayed in the apartment good size apt Room clean Hotel staff recommended a fab rest near by thanks 
205750,Residence Henri IV,No Negative, Location location location Notre Dame nearby with stops for open air step on step off buses Overnight parking garage within 5 minute walk to hotel and very reasonable Our favorite restaurant in Paris Petit Pontoise right down the street 
205751,Residence Henri IV, The housekeeping staff could have done a better job They did not replace the coffee supplies daily and some light bulbs were not working that they should have replaced , The location could not have been better The front desk staff was extremely helpful in making dinner reservations and recommendations 
205752,Residence Henri IV, Rather small room completely dominated by 4 poster bed shower screen not quite big enough, Historic hotel good location clean nice bathroom friendly staff
205753,Residence Henri IV, It s small It s very pricey given the amount of space , A well furnished and meticulously decorated luxury apartment at a very good location Being in a cul de sac it is also very quiet in contrast to the busy surrounding streets

205755,Residence Henri IV, There weren t any drawers in our room so we couldn t unpack completely , Staff was very friendly and helpful and the location was just what we wanted It was quiet and yet within walking distance of so many attractions restaurants and the metro 
205756,Residence Henri IV, I ve stayed here a previous time and loved the room I had before on a higher floor On this stay the bathroom was smaller and a little awkwardly designed compared to the previous stay But I really like this hotel and would stay again , Charming small hotel in a very good location It is close to many sites places to eat yet it is also quiet and tucked away from other tourists and crowds The rooms are comfortable clean and spacious for a small boutique hotel Staff is always helpful and friendly
