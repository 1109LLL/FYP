495052,Starhotels Tourist, We can t really think of anything we didn t like , Loved the room Very clean with a very comfortable bed Also the staff was very nice and eager to help There is a metro station right in front of the hotel so it s quite easy to get around although it is a bit further from the city centre than we would have liked 30 min by metro but we knew that before we made the reservation All in all it was the perfect choice for our weekend in Milano

495057,Starhotels Tourist, Roomkeys were given to me without a proper check even got once the key to 3xx instead of 2xx when I was locked out Hotel is on main road but mostly quiet except those pesky ambulances every now and then at night ,No Positive
495058,Starhotels Tourist, Staff could be a little friendlier Eye contact and a smile never hurt anyone Localisation is a little bit far from any sites of interest but that also spares you the traffic jams in and out of Milan , Very clean calm well furnished and has comfy beds a gym is also available 
495059,Starhotels Tourist, All was perfect Maybe just missing fresh vegetables for breakfast tomato cucumber , It is the best choice for Milano Nice service good breakfasts lovely clean rooms We stayed there the second time and got the same very nice room with espresso machine kettle tea Very comfortable bed efficient air conditioning Large very clean bathroom All was really super We can only recommend hope that will be only for us next time a free room maybe this our room greetings Thank You for all 
495060,Starhotels Tourist, Fridge wasnt enough cold drinks were always hot Hotel more far from the centre than mentioned 20 minutes by car , Big and clean room Modern and confortable
495061,Starhotels Tourist, The breakfast is not bad but could a bit better with more choices for this good hotel Around the hotel in the evening there are travesty , The room was very good we were in twin rooms with my friends and the beds was very comfortable and big There is also a coach in the room just in front of the big TV screen There is also private parking included in the hotel price 
495062,Starhotels Tourist, Breakfast to identify with tags especially meat The location of items to be more convenient Tea bags were away from hot water dispenser , Easy access and convenience Service and flexibility from Staff
495063,Starhotels Tourist, not in a walking distance to the city centre but the metro is just in front of the hotel, clean big rooms very quiet comfy bed good breakfast a lot of options friendly and helpful staff
495064,Starhotels Tourist, Nothing all was good although the room numbering was unusual , The staff were really excellent The location was literally at the metro stop The breakfast was fine and the rooms were excellent value especially for such a big city For anyone doing the Milan parkrun this is the hotel that you want to stay in being opposite Parco Nord 
495065,Starhotels Tourist, The Air Condition does not work at night Only the fan will work I complained at the front desk and I was informed that night time they turn off A C , Great Mattress Great Staff Service at the restaurant by the employee is excellent 
495066,Starhotels Tourist, Staff was not very helpful The room was the worst room in the hotel Even i am a booking genius staff didn t meet my expectations , Room was well furnished and modern The hotel was clean 
495067,Starhotels Tourist, No electric kettle to have a coffee in the room No stores around to take a walk, Leaving rhe car at the hotel and taking the subway downtown in front of the hotel The room was big and comfortable
495068,Starhotels Tourist, Virtually nothing to dislike about the hotel itself If I m being super picky then I will say that the room is a wee bit on the cool side even with the quite noisy A C off and there is very little in the area around the hotel not a shop restaurant or bar in sight so be prepared with snacks and refreshments if you don t wish to pay extortionate mini bar prices eg 5 for a tiny bottle of Coke , Everything The junior suite is spacious clean and comfortable staff are professional friendly and well presented the buffet breakfast is delicious with lots of choice the proximity of the hotel to Bignami metro station literally across the road is excellent just 10 minutes ride from the city centre and 30 minutes from the iconic Giuseppe Meazza San Siro Stadium which is perfect if like I did you re Milan bound to watch a football match shame Inter lost at home to Napoli oh and satellite TV includes Sky Sports with seemingly round the clock calcio to watch before heading out to the game My girlfriend and I loved our couple of nights here and will almost certainly return next season for another visit to see Internazionale Grazie mille per tutto e speriamo di vederti presto 
495069,Starhotels Tourist, Air conditioning very bad in the rooms almost no air flowing in the rooms Bed Pillow not comfortable, Metro station directly infront of the hotel Spacious rooms
495070,Starhotels Tourist, We originally booked a queen bed but in our room was two double beds However we didn t complain about it since we were really tired and just wanted to get into bed and anyway had a nice sleep , We stopped at the hotel for one night only on our way home from Asia and we could not choose better place for resting on our long way Room and bathroom were really clean location is good for those who are seeking a rest from crowds Breakfast was amazing especially for Italy With a very nice choice of fresh fruits eggs and pastries 
495071,Starhotels Tourist, The hotel is a bit far from the center Shutters of the neighbors making noise in the morning , Comfortable hotel Double windows ensuring efficient noise protection from the street Close to metro station Efficient room service 
495072,Starhotels Tourist, Free wifi at less than 1 mb s so had to upgrade to the 6 euro day paying one No power plug near the bed to charge phone Quite a lot of noise from neigbouring rooms , Very friendly staff and good food in the restaurant Excellent beds Right at subway entrance 
495073,Starhotels Tourist, Breakfast was just ok cheap industrially produced cakes croissants and fruit cocktail The television wasn t enabled to change the language settings to English , Comfortable clean great shower Metro station is directly in front of the hotel and the highway is 7 10 minutes away 
495074,Starhotels Tourist, Even though it s close to metro station this hotel is too far from the center Staff are not welcoming and helpful, The rooms are clean and comfortable
495075,Starhotels Tourist, Furniture is worn out In the first room the security box was not working They moved us in another room but it was a smoker room really In 2017 Smell was horrible all night long Furthermore one of the pillows had several long hair on the back side I brought it to the reception but this i not what I would expect from a 4 star, Close to the metro station
495076,Starhotels Tourist, The area around the hotel was a little gloomy , The extra comfortable room and super comfy bed The copious breakfast buffet The close proximity to a metro stop to downtown Milano 
495077,Starhotels Tourist, The location was not that good I wouldn t advice you to walk there during the night It is deserted and the hotel is a bit far 15 mins walking from the night bus stop in case one wants to come back with the night buses on Friday and Saturday Many lady boys were working close during the night , The room was really clean and cleaned every day The beds were very comfortable The breakfast was fresh and tasty with variety of food croissants omelette sausages with bacon fruits marmalade cakes and much more The metro station was in front of the hotel The TV had many channels some of them in English too BBC CNBC etc The WiFi was free and with excellent signal quality They also provided a better speed for heavy usage if needed but I think it wasn t for free It was a great value for money for us since we booked it with 70 discount 
495078,Starhotels Tourist, Breakfast could be better it was only in itallian style , Stefano was wonderfull owner very helpfull and kind man he reccomanded us nice places to see arround lake Como Accomodation was on super place near the lake and center Room was big a and nice We were very satisfied 
495079,Starhotels Tourist, Unfortunately the breakfast was not great at all Last year when I was there it was ok but its really gone down I ate a hand full of items the whole time I was there Next time I will book a room without breakfast and just eat at a bar since that turned out better , The location is fantastic in my point of view and for the purpose of my stay The rooms are big for their price and they are clean 
495080,Starhotels Tourist, The pillows are terrible very uncomfortable and old The shower hose was broken but glued kind of hard to use it properly For breakfast kind of slow in restocking the food at the buffet and too much oil is used at cooking The gym is poor equipped only 2 weight training machines and 1 was broken But thank God for the dumbbells , Easy access to the city center even though is located a bit far from the center 15 20mins the metro station is right in front of the hotel The hotel is modern the room is a bit small but clean and cozy with large TV staff is really nice and helpful Breakfast was ok not so much variety but the coffee is really good Good price quality highly recommend it 
495081,Starhotels Tourist, No lift from the underground parking no tea coffee maker in a room no availability of baby bad only very small crib for new borns , Hotel is located next to the metro station from which you can get to the city center good WiFi signal nice breakfast private parking free late check out available upon request 
495082,Starhotels Tourist, Furniture is a bit outdated but nice nevertheless , Amazing breakfast one of the best that we ever had in Italy Very comfortable beds and quiet rooms Exactly opposite is the Metro station which takes you in 20 minutes to the city center Duomo Secure car park 
495083,Starhotels Tourist, The breakfast is not worth it Just book without breakfast and get it in a bar or cafe nearby I think I ate 3 croissants and 3 coffees while there for 4 days It was just sad and incomplete and the fruit looked and tasted old Seemed like they kept the food of the day before and kept putting it out after adding a few fresh items It was way better last year when I was there , It was clean good location for me and the security is good in the hotel with a gate and staff at reception all day and night 
495084,Starhotels Tourist, Limited parking places breakfast does not offer great choice rooms were a bit cold fast wifi for extra fee, Metro station 20 meters from hotel entrance comfortable bed free wifi slow room cleaning every day friendly and helpful hotel staff
495085,Starhotels Tourist, We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and when we started packing to check out on the last day I noticed that money were missing from a closed not see through bag left on the table My first reaction was that this is not possible moreover since for someone to take the money he she must have went through our stuff in the bags This was for me unbelievable My overall impression went so down at that moment even though we were impressed by the hotel room at arrival Of course we complained at the reception and of course we knew that we would not see this money again but we were so frustrated I could not believe that these kind of things still happen At the reception they told us that they were also surprised as this kind of things have never happened before However I noticed an older review for the same hotel on TripAdvisor when also money were taken from the table In our case the money were not even displayed but they went through our stuff to find it which is the worst intrusion of privacy If these kind of things often happen I advise to everyone TO BE AWARE OF THIS HOTEL , Nothing after what happened the last day 
495086,Starhotels Tourist, No big deal but rooms are a little bit small for 2 , Location Metro station is right in front of the building Everything was very good in the rooms as well Beds are very comfortable stuff is very helpful Very very clean tidy and a compact hotel for a milano visit 
495087,Starhotels Tourist, Room was at the basement shower place was very small really difucult to use area t isnt close to center 20minutes with metro wifi was not working in the room Reservation of my room was flexible and has last day cancelation but day charge some amount before 3 days from arriving which was make me unsafe They have to write exact deposit rules to booking , Room was new equips of room were new Breakfast was very good Staff was helpful Mr Luigi was very helpful from reception Car parkin was free of charge 
495088,Starhotels Tourist, One of the rooms was a bit cool because it was on the corner and the heatting wasn t working properly because of the date as i understood from the staff but they provided us with extra blankets Probably the would have changed the room if they had anything available , The staff was nice helpful and very receptive to our needs Food was great Place was very clean It wasn t noisy Subway station just outside the hotel I would totally stay here again even though it is far form the center 
495089,Starhotels Tourist,No Negative, Close proximity to the metro line ensured easy and hassle free access in the city centre The hotel itself is a well maintained and excellent facility with generous bedrooms and well serviced bathrooms and room facilities The staff were courteous friendly and helpful 
495090,Starhotels Tourist, Prostitutes around the hotel, Staff kind and available Good breakfast Croissants were Italian style tasty but light Room was very confortable big Silent Parking included
495091,Starhotels Tourist, Envinronment is not attractive but the hotel cannot change it Another and againg not hotel related issue is a city tax 15 Euro per room Milan minicipality is killing , the staff is very freindly we arrived at 3 am and nothing was open in the hotel or arround but the desk clerk was very kind and organied for us tea coffee set in the room Check in out is very fast and easy Internet is of strong signal and fast enough Room facilities are clean and well mainained 
495092,Starhotels Tourist, The Wi Fi signal was weak in our room, Very clean hotel The staff are friendly and helpful Thank you All there is underground station directly in front of the hotel gate within 15 min we reach the downtown 
495093,Starhotels Tourist,No Negative, First They give us a room with broken bed but when we told them they changed it to a better room nice clean hotel with great choices of breakfast connected with tram and metro the metro station feels like it s part of the hotel which is amazing 
495094,Starhotels Tourist, Reception staff service never put on a smiley face Not very responsive and helpful for providing travel tips, Excellent location one minute walk to metro Excellent breakfast with lots of food choices
495095,Starhotels Tourist, It s located in the middle of nowhere and you have to take at least 2 trains to get somewhere The wifi was kind of weak and also there are prostitutes wandering around the hotel after 8 pm which I found kind of hilarious but also worrisome Breakfast costs 12 euros which is ridiculous for what is offered , Superb hotel with amazing rooms an amazing bathroom and a really professional and welcoming staff 
495096,Starhotels Tourist, The pictures didn t show the same room interior But yet the room was clean and nice The hotel is abit far from the city center , The hotel was good The restaurant had a good variety of food for breakfast The staff was friendly enough 
495097,Starhotels Tourist, Old hotel ugly colors not cozy Room very dark The view was toward a closed yard you were feeling like at prison Very far away from the city center Parking free just if you find a free spot Breakfast not good The eggs were green the ham was smelling bad we could only eat a croissant Price way too high according to the conditions Would not stay there again , The bathroom was refurbished Spacious room AC good working 
495098,Starhotels Tourist, None , The hotel is very clean and nice The metro station is just right in front of it Walking distance from a mall if you d prefer to eat our rather than dining at the hotel Staff were very accommodating and nice They gave us a map and showed us the best places to visit in Milan We got a deluxe upgrade for only EUR20 per night and the room was really fab With a walk in closet and bath Free parking for genius bookers 
495099,Starhotels Tourist, Nothing , Location right beside a quiet metro station Milan Centrale railway station in 15 minutes Excellent accomodation modern clean friendly helpful staff 
495100,Starhotels Tourist, the surroundings of the hotel, good breakfast with plenty to choose from nice garden and eating area comfortable bed the metro station is right in front of the hotel 35 40min to the dome station free parking for genius booking members 
495101,Starhotels Tourist, The only small minus was the distance from the city centre but that was well compensated for by the excellent metro line immediately across the street from the hotel entrance by the private parking hall and affordability of the rooms in comparison with the city centre hotels Besides since Milan is a big city you probably need to use the metro line anyway to go about at some point However the appr 30 min travel time to the city centre was rather long so we didnt feel like visiting the hotel during the day before dinner , Nice standard in all areas cleanliness pleasant professional and helpful staff breakfast quiet at night free wifi free garage for genius members vicinity to metro line
495102,Starhotels Tourist, a bit out of the way the subway stops right accross the road in six subway stops one can be at the duomo the breakfast could be more competitive like in spain for what one gets , very happy with the experience 
495103,Starhotels Tourist, It was a little noisy in the room Probably the sound was coming from the central airconditioning system that could not be regulated from the room I told the reception about it and they was going to send the technician to look at it but have not heard more from them while issue was still there Apart of that it was a great stay , Nice clean and comfortable room good breakfast friendly staff Good location just next to the metro easy to reach from train station and easy to come to city center 
495104,Starhotels Tourist, The street on which the hotel is located gets populated with hookers at night so it feels a bit dodgy, Very nice clean hotel friendly and professional staff good breakfast
495105,Starhotels Tourist, This is much further than I thought You have to change one metro line and almost 10 stops just to get to the center of city The internet of star hotels are the worst of all my hotel experiences including star hotel splendid in Venice and this one And I don t know why house keeper went in my room anyway even if I put the Do Not Disturb sign outside , There was a metro station right in front of the hotel Facility was relatively new 
495106,Starhotels Tourist, Breakfast very basic Only hot food sausage scrambled egg which wasn t very nice Rude front of house staff outside that let you in the gate After sending us underground to park the car he hadn t told reception to unlock the gate so we had to walk back up tell him he didn t go in to tell them he sent us in to do it , Interconnecting room Clean tidy
495107,Starhotels Tourist, Normally four star hotels offer body lotions here there was none , The hotel is fantastically connected to the city centre with the metro station right in front of its entrance 
495108,Starhotels Tourist,No Negative, Modern comfortable rooms Black out shutters allow for long peaceful sleep I left my kindle in the room after checking out The staff found it I ll pick it up on my next trip Fantastic Thank you 
495109,Starhotels Tourist,No Negative, At first we saw it from outside and were disappointed but once inside very impressed Across from the last underground station it s an easy ride to all the action 
495110,Starhotels Tourist, Not a lot of choice and lack of diversity during breakfast Staff was not so welcomed The offer through booking was exaggerated Better book through their own website as it is probably the same price or less expensive , Bed and fitness was OK Location next to a metro station but it takes around 15 min to reach de city with a change 
495111,Starhotels Tourist, Filtered my search for hotels with shuttle service to the airport and selected this property purely on that At check in I was informed that the hotel didn t offer this service and that a taxi would have costed me 50 euros Staff was unhelpful and I checked out a couple of hours later payed the full amount anyway ,No Positive
495112,Starhotels Tourist, Wi fi was a bit slugghish at times other than that everything was fine worth it , Breakfest was good Location right across the street of the bignami metro station 20 minutes to reach city centre by metro Spacious room
495113,Starhotels Tourist,No Negative, The room was very clean and big We had a Deluxe room and we were able to really rest for the room is soundproofed Metro is located in front of the hotel You will reach the center in roughly 20mins with 1 change The receptionist Ms Manuela R was really very nice and accomodating We had a wonderful stay 
495114,Starhotels Tourist, Location is bit far from central even it s just next to metro station but with metro you still need 15 mins at least it s at end station of M5 to be arrived in the most popular area and shower room is just terrible Mold on the wall in bathroom and water floating all over after 30 seconds shower I personally won t recommend this hotel to you And I have to say I don t give bad review often because I respect the package they deliver but this hotel isn t worth for staying even with bargain price , Sevice
495115,Starhotels Tourist, The room is dry and too warm Window is not easy to open for air The payment of tourist tax was not clear arranged Eventually they reserved double the amount on our credit card After emailing it was solved , Location is just outside the city But its very easy to get to everywhere with metro since its just next to the hotel 20min with metro to central station Nice bathroom and the bed is comfortable Nice buffet breakfast 
495116,Starhotels Tourist, There are a large amount of prostitutes that hang around the hotel There was a theft at the hotel where one of my group had there wallet stolen The CCTV apparently did not pick this up We know that a member of the reception staff stole this Muhammad who works in the restaurant in the evening is possibly the rudest person I have ever met shouting at guests is not a great way of making an positive impact I will NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN it is the WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED IN , The barman was knowledgeable and very helpful This is the hotels one saving grace I would recommend making him the hotel manager as he is the only member of staff that seemed to care about myself and my group The location is good for the local tube station but other than that you are in the middle of no ware 
495117,Starhotels Tourist, Crowded parking space inside the hotel s courtyard , Nice personnel and fast check in out The room is decent size and has a nice Tv with a lot of channels to choose from The room was good insulated and no outside noises disturbed us Safe parking and easy to find hotel Good breakfast nice outside terrace 
495118,Starhotels Tourist, staff at the reception were not particularly friendly i ordered a greek salad at the restaurant and the dish was ONLY feta cheese olives and salad Very poor for this type of hotel definitely overrated , staff at the restaurant are very friendly comfortable bed
495119,Starhotels Tourist, The neighbourhood isnt exactly nice especially at night with lots of potential crime around, Good breakfast clean and nice rooms airconditioning working ferm nice bed good soundproofing parking 
495120,Starhotels Tourist, No signs for door Do not disturb Clean Some people who came to hotel in early morning of Sunday were very loud for about an hour and it was hard to sleep Super boring tv chennels even no music to have there could be at least a list of what channels and radio channels you have in order to find some music small room, Very nice breakfast Easy to find Clean Quite and nice place inside By the way the metro works till midnight there i have seen somewhere here wrong information
495121,Starhotels Tourist,No Negative, The staff were very nice and helpful I enjoyed the opportunity of a cooked breakfast unlike so many hotels in Milan Bed substantial comfortable quality linens the room was well furnished 
495122,Starhotels Tourist, The biggest minus you can hear everything from the next room and bathroom lucky for us we had quiet neighbours Breakfast could be more varied A little far from city center but metro very close 20 min to central station 30 to city center, Very nice staff close to metro comfortable bed good croissants and coffee breakfast at 6 30 
495123,Starhotels Tourist,No Negative, Great hotel in a very good location opposite Bignami metro station 20 minutes away from duomo Very close to the city mall with cinemas and restaurants The bed was very comfortable always clean 
495124,Starhotels Tourist, We should have been notified of taxes in advance, Fixtures and fittings in the rooms were excellent Easy to park and Metro was adjacent and very convenient 
495125,Starhotels Tourist, The thermostats was not working so it was very hot but it was an unlucky thing the hotel is still very good, Right in front of the train stop comfortable room very nice breakfast
495126,Starhotels Tourist, Location was far away from centre Hard to get to airport in early morning Price was a bit high for the location but maybe that is how Milano is , The rooms were nice and quite big Staff was friendly and organized what needed Close to metro stop 
495127,Starhotels Tourist, We could hear the draining of the shower in the room above us, The small gym was excellent and the front desk attendant recommended a good local Italian restaurant for one of the nights with transport to and from the venue The breakfast was adequate and the room was functional and clean
495128,Starhotels Tourist, The only slight negative to staying at this location is the distance to the downtown sights We spent about 25 minutes each way on the metro which is just out the front door of the hotel Not a huge inconvenience but a touch time consuming , This hotel was perfect We had a great experience as a family of 4 staying in a family room which is two rooms with an adjoining door Breakfast was great with cooked eggs bacon and sausage along with the usual offerings The staff was courteous and professional everything you would expect from a 4 star hotel I would stay here again anytime 
495129,Starhotels Tourist,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and helpful upon arrival Good variety of bread fruit eggs and meat for breakfast Location was great right across from metro station 
495130,Starhotels Tourist, The shower head was somehow blocked so the water didn t come out properly We couldn t adjust the air conditioner Although we set the temperature to 15 C but it seems to be that the temperature is set and locked at around 23 C which is too warm for us to sleep Breakfast was okay , Quiet room with sound proofed window comfortable bed good internet signal staff are helpful and speak good English Very convenient location right in front of metro station Bignami free indoor parking 
495131,Starhotels Tourist,No Negative, Fantastic staff they are friendly and very helpfull if you need directions extra blankets free luggage storage after check out The room is clean comfortable and quiet Very good breakfast and excellent restaurant 
495132,Starhotels Tourist, a little far from city center if you are coming back to the hotel outside of metro hours if during metro hours only one metro change and around 7 9 stops and you reach the Dom breakfast kind of basic but good , staff was very friendly coffee was good shopping mall with supermarket near metro station right in front of the hotel just had to cross the street the street where the hotel is situated not in front of the hotel is full with hookers at night which is really pleasant for the eye during the taxi drive back to your room 
495133,Starhotels Tourist, Check out was a bit slow as there was only one person to take care of customers so had to wait a bit but not too long No bathtub in the room as advertised , Proximity to metro station Room was very clean and quiet 
495134,Starhotels Tourist, Breakfast was good however you would expect more for a 4 star hotel Absolutely ridiculous to limit the wifi connectuon for only 2 devices for a 4 star hotel On the first day we issues with hot water for shower that was probably solved for the next days Key frequently got unmagnetised even if we avoided putting near credit cards , Staff always very friendly except for one receptionist who was rude upon answering questions about the wifi that wasn t working properly The hotel is modern very clean and located in front of a metro station although far away from the city centre On rainy days umbrellas we made availble for guests Heating system worked correctly
495135,Starhotels Tourist, No bars near the hotel so you have to use the bar at the hotel were drinks are expensive ok I know it s a 4 star hotel a normal bottle of beer cost 6 50, Cosy room clean bathroom good breakfast staff very helpfull
495136,Starhotels Tourist, the restaurant was not working only few alternatives within walking distance, very clean hotel free parking looks secured close to tube station if needed as the hotel located far from city center
495137,Starhotels Tourist, Break fast is just Italian that s means a croissant and or a couple of different cake and then the coffee is not as good as you expect They are far away from serving a decent continental breakfast, Location is good if you have to be around Bicocca Brera Area and then the Metro to city center is just outside the hotel and
495138,Starhotels Tourist,No Negative, Staff were very helpful every time we stay in milano we stay in this hotel Comfy beds big car park in front of metro station Nearby big shopping centre centro sarca and hospital 
495139,Starhotels Tourist, Too far from the city center Only one supermarket 15 min walk away The interior looks a bit old Be careful with the money on your card first hotel tried to pre authorize city tax that was already paid in cash on my card second upon check out they said they confirmed pre authorizations made after every day of our stay in a final payment a sum of all blocked sums I was told that no more payment will be made they just confirmed the previous ones But checking my card a bit later I discovered that sum for our 3 nights stay was taken twice Hotel insisted that they took money only once but my bank confirmed there was double payment request from the hotel and after my complaint bank cancelled one of the operations Taking into account we stayed in the hotel in the beginning of our journey it wasn t really nice experience with money , Good breakfast comfortable bed quiet room staff was nice and helpful 
495140,Starhotels Tourist, The Wifi connection was poor , Rooms were spacious and very clean The Metro is right in front of the hotel so we could conveniently move around the city There is a shopping mall within 10 to 15 walk Most of the staff were friendly especially Mohamed restaurant 
495141,Starhotels Tourist, Location there isnt much around but there is a Metro stop across the street 10 15 min direct to centre , Large room size Modern style everything in room seemed new Nice restaurant for lunch dinner good breakfast too hot cold good fresh fruit pastries selection Very good value
495142,Starhotels Tourist, The hotel is like made of paper you can hear everyone form nearby rooms so is very difficult to rest The air conditioning or heating can give you health problems because is very dry , Close to the metro Nice stuff Clean
495143,Starhotels Tourist,No Negative, Great location Very easy to get to any place the metro staion Bignami is just infront of the hotel Great staff and hotel rooms We stayed a total 8 days 7 nights breakfast included Worth every penny You realy don t need an expensive hotel in the center of Milan when you got Starhotel We where on christmas and new year so know that 80 of the restaurants in Milan are closed especially pizzerias but everything eles works about the same My advice is to call a restaurant via youre hotel to make sure they are realy open tripadviser is missleading 
495144,Starhotels Tourist, Break fast is not good they don t have that much to eat for breakfast Breakfast is 000000 sorry for that but i never expected like this If you want to eat omelette for breakfast you the hotel chage extra 10 Euro for one omelette This is very expensive, Location is good and clean
495145,Starhotels Tourist, The price was a little high for the hotel and when we checked out it was quite a confusion as we didn t realize there was a daily tax which is very high in Milan Otherwise it was good , The hotel was nice and clean The location was good for us and while it s not in the city center if u do need to go downtown a cab or the metro will get u there quite fast The other really nice thing was the restaurant which was very well priced and they made us special dishes to our liking 
495146,Starhotels Tourist, Stayed as a couple had 2 single beds awaiting us on arrival 2nd night they were just shoved together under 1 sheet after we complained Also requested to stay a third night and we were informed the price would triple for that night, Staff pleasant not fully accomodating
495147,Starhotels Tourist, Standard room is a bit small , Directly in front of the metro stop Modern facilities Excellent breakfast buffet eggs bacon fresh fruit deserts cappuccino etc 
495148,Starhotels Tourist, 1 about 50 meters away working girls were lined up on the street at night 2 the hotel two lifts one was not working Even if worked it was slow any way , 1 The station was just out side the hotel That made it easy to the city center 2 However the station closes at 12 00am so if you want to enjoy your night at the cafes at the Domo You have to get a taxi 3 The room size was good
