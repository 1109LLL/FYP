3813,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, The hotel is situated in the worst area of Paris as the black cab driver i used from outside the station informed me as he charged me five times the going rate for dropping me there The Kube hotel is situated up a dirty side round with timber boarding across the front in the day and 3 4 doorman in the evening The ice bar in the hotel looks nothing like the advert on their website ,No Positive
3814,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, Location not far from Gard de Nord otherwise somewhat out of the way until we found our way around the Metro which was good Breakfast not impressive little choice coffee not hot Bar had limited opening times closed early so no customers no atmosphere D cor seating was good so if the management put some effort into it would do a lot better Ice Bar was a great novelty but at 18C we didn t fancy it perhaps next time we will brave it Also a kettle in the room would be helpful , Room was very modern spacious Bed extremely comfortable Shower brilliant Staff very helpful
3815,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, The showers in the rooms are awful not enclosed with just a tap extension on the wall which is too low and the water sprays everywhere, The ice bar was an excellent feature
3816,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, The location wasn t the best but it was real close to the metro which got you anywhere you wanted in minutes So it wasn t so bad , The hotel is amazingly designed The walls and curtains are fluffy What more could you want The staff were all really helpful and friendly We woke up without hot water and they immediately upgraded us to a bigger room However they noticed the hot water issue was covering the full hotel which unfortunately they couldn t get fixed immediately on a Saturday They offered all customers 30 of their booking back which was great 
3817,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, Limited food available from the reception bar , Staff very friendly and helpful location perfect for getting anywhere we needed to go in Paris and decor of the hotel was cool 
3818,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, Booking com advertised my room as having a bath however it didn t The TV didn t work meaning the wifi didn t work Advised staff of both issues and received no offer of resolution Acted as though because it was a last minute booking due to Eurostar cancellation that it was my problem and I should just make do Very sub standard, Cool room decorations were very gaudy
3819,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, Worst hotel ever Awful location bar and restaurant closed all 3 days we were there Non existent receptionists and TV reception was variable Had junior suite but no robes no proper shower either , Room was clean
3820,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, No proper light over bathroom mirror Bathroom open to room Nightclub feel to corridors Floor in foyer worn and didn t appear clean breakfast was set up there and with the black decor was not very inviting we took our breakfast out into the courtyard The breakfast buffet was okay but the cheese was in a container which had previously been used for a fish buffet a whiff of old seafood at breakfast The corridors walls were covered with a black fake fur , The bed was very comfortable 
3821,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, I didn t feel very comfortable around the area and the fact you could hear people outside the room most of the night as well was not the best , The hotel overall was very nice 
3822,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, Very bad experience as I lost more than 700 euros It was stolen from my bag I just knew when I arrived back , The hotel is good expect staff at counter and the room service Very bad experience as I lost more than 700 Euros from my bag that I kept inside room It was although my mistake that I should not left money in my bag as I know room cleaning people will come and might take the money 
3823,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, Toilet not clean on arrival no shower curtain shower fixture loose bad smell in room , Room was spacious bed very comfortable interesting building 
3824,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, very bad area in the station neighborhood staff couldn t speak English so it was extremely difficult to communicate lack of communication among staff which forced me to repeat things to each member of staff it took me 1 hr to check out , only the room decor
3825,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, We didn t have a bad experience but the location seems a little unsafe at night WLking in the day is fine but I would be more inclined to take a taxi at night There were a lot of youths and homeless out drinking This is unfortunately out of the hands of the hotel , The hotel is a great boutique hotel The rooms are great and the hotel staff where helpful and friendly 
3826,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, Fitness club was out of order which was the only reason I booked this particular hotel for the price The staff were vague about the situation and it never got fixed during our 5 day stay And there are no parks nearby for running There were some strangely quirky aspects to the room layour that didn t make sense like a shower with no door or curtain which left an inch of water on the bathroom carpet There was no drain in the floor and all of this meant we could only take baths all week , The staff were nice and it s a very funky hotel with a night club decor but sort of well done The Ice Bar is a must 
3827,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, the noise and the neighbourhood,No Positive
3828,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, First day cold water and no breakfast Localization very bad on a dangerous zone ,No Positive
3829,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, Gym, Fantastic staff very professional management
3830,Kube Hotel Ice Bar, very bad location very shabby area staff did not speak good English so very difficult to communicate, nice room design
3831,Kube Hotel Ice Bar,No Negative, it s such a terrible experience
