271542,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, the only thing was that the hotel was slightly hidden which makes it a little harder to find and for more options on the breakfast room service but thats really being picky, the bed so ever so comfy room service was superb shower facilities where above and beyond and an excellent surprise that the room had a safe and english channels would definately recommend this hotel to anyone
271543,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, no closet in room hotel under construction no comfortable chair in room do seal on shower door water all over floor all glass bathroom no privacy long walk to public transportation , the canal view

271546,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, We enjoyed our stay and the hotel suited our needs so nothing not to like, Excellent area for visiting the museum quarter 9 streets area and alll of the main must see sites Staff were very friendly and helpful Close to tram stop into city 
271547,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Staff could be more friendly They seemed to be overly professional Also they charge for the shuttle service to the airport 7 euros considering a number of costs that it goes for the daily price I think it was unnecessary , Overrall good experience I would stay there again 
271548,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel was being renovated and too much construction noise and disruption This wax not mentioned in the details when booking Also we were refused service in the restaurant as the were down one staff Will never stay there again ,No Positive
271549,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The room was spacious with a great view and has all the facilities you need AC big TV Safe box Iron Machine Desk Etc i was in the 6th floor and was looking at the beautiful canal the location is good the neighborhood is beautiful i enjoyed walking to the nearest tram station which is around 10 minutes walk so it takes around 25 minutes to reach the center there is a gas station next to the hotel which has a supermarket that has everything 
271550,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, We were not made aware that there were extensive renovations taking place rendering most public spaces inaccessible In addition there was no lift to our downstairs room so we had to carry our heavy luggage ourselves up and down extensive staircases We were not asked if we would mind and no one offered to help with the luggage , A beautiful room well appointed and comfortable Helpful and well informed staff at the front desk and friendly service 
271551,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Didn t see the full hotel restaurant etc because it was being refurbed I was made aware of this before my stay therefore planned to eat out a lot of the time so this didn t really effect my stay, Great hotel even though it was being refurbed during the time i was staying this didn t effect my stay Room service every day and the reception staff were really friendly 
271552,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Very expensive to eat or drink room was small and dark two lights not working and no maintenance cover on weekend Towels and condiments not replaced every day , The Harbour Bar
271553,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel is under renovation which means noise during daytime The breakfast is expensive and bad dry bread and sliced cheese that bends the ends upward Best advice is to find delicious breakfast in town for half price, Hotel is located within walking distance to downtown Nice big rooms and friendly service Fitness room is very nice but small so there is queue
271554,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, ongoing construction work INSIDE the hotel i e loud power drilling all morning long right next to my room not conveniently located for public transport food overpriced for mediocre quality , staff were friendly room was nice 
271555,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Referbishment process on the ground floor in summer period when hotel is overbooked , Staff on reception is very friendly and ready to help provided me a nice chennel view without additional fee 
271556,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Noise of maintenance Refurbish and I wanted to have room service menu not only for the breakfast but during the night I don t know if they have it or not, Receptionist lady was amazing She was so helpful and full of hospitality with very nice smile Even though part of facilities are under maintenance refurbish but still I was very satisfied 
271557,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Rooms v small and dark Poor lighting no access to mirror near socket to dry hair Drinks expensive , Location on canals Easy walk to shops and park Wonderful dining room
271558,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The room seemt busy when we arrived there were clothes on the beds We were changed room and in the new room the toilets were dirty The person at the reception was not friendly At the restaurant the service was long we had to wait a long time before being served for dinner and for breakfast there was nobody taking care of us we just had to help ourselves to get the cutlery They are currently working to rebuilt and renew the hotel The new decoration is very gloomy and black and looks like it is here since a very long time what a pity, The breakfast the nice restaurant on the water it was quiet
271559,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The room was brilliant Everything was nicely decorated and the room felt spacious We had an amazing view of the canal too The hotel was in an ideal location for us about a 25 minute walk from the hub of the city there is a bus stop right next to the hotel which takes you to Zuid station or Amstel station in a few minutes Loved the tv the fridge was handy and the free hotel shuttle to the airport was great Overall it was fab 
271560,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Would recommend that the property get Smart TV s with Netflix app Also the day before we checked out we did not receive cleaning service but could be that we left too late that day , The staff were professional helpful and accommodating Our room had a beautiful room of the harbor and was very clean It was also very spacious 
271561,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Not much I suppose it is far from the city center but the neighborhood had some great restaurants and it was pleasant to walk around It is a bit older of a building but still very nice , The hotel grounds were very pretty with a small forest area in front Our room looked into the canal and had a nook which you could sit in and look at the canal The design of the room was nice and clean and comfortable There were bikes to rent in for 16 euros a day 
271562,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The pillows were awful The maid kept leaving the shower turned to as hot as it would go, The balcony with the view of the Amstel was an unexpected but greatly appreciated surprise Staff were great very helpful
271563,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, bar was a bit load with a disco but cant complain it was a Saturday night and fancied a quite drink in the bar, Beds were comfortable rooms nice and clean
271564,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, It is not functioning as a 4 star hotel because all shared space and most of territory is a construction sight , Room with harbor view after expensive upgrade
271565,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Unfortunately the Apollo was going thru renovations so the place looked like a bomb had gone off We didn t get a nice relaxed vibe and felt under tension during out stay One afternoon after walking around Amsterdam for 6 hours or so we returned to our room and it hadn t been cleaned As we had to have a shower with dirty towels and as we were on a timeline for the next function we were disappointed , Beds were comfy The room was clean upon arrival but not cleaned in time the following day Shower was good but the design resulted in a lot of water spray over the floor which resulted in really wet towels
271566,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, I ve stayed here before because of the location but I feel really let down Major refurbishment works going on dust everywhere drilling banging for gods sake close the hotel down and do the work so guests don t have to suffer the hassle of stepping through a building site Still charging full price for the rooms Breakfast is 22 50 and is self serve Can t eat food in the bar even when there are no tables left in the restaurant non Dutch guests treated really poorly by the staff, Nothing
271567,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel is undergoing some refurbishment so entrance hall was not very welcoming and had to negotiate workmen to get to restaurant during working hours Very difficult to get a table in the restaurant we were told they were fully booked on 2 nights even though we could see empty tables as we walked to alternative restaurants nearby Limited computer access at business centre perhaps due to improvements There is apparently a shuttle from the airport but no instructions about where to find it , Quiet attractive location Easy to get to the city centre on tram Comfortable room and beds Range of good eating places within 5 10 minutes walk Good food in the restaurant when you can get a table which has a beautiful setting overlooking the canal 
271568,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, There was refurbishment going on which we were not aware of when we booked Would love to go back and see the improvements once completed, Location on the side of the canal was lovely
271569,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, There were builders onsite the restaurant couldn t take our booking because it was full both nights We were asked to leave the bar at 10 pm because they had a private party and we were not welcome The shuttle transport was not as accessible as it might have been , Able to leave luggage early morning The reception staff were helpful and considerate We didn t bother with the restaurant and took our business along the road to the seven restaurant where we had a great breakfast for 10 euros 
271570,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, I was not aware it was being refurbished and parts were a building site Very loud at night from doors banging and people drinking on a boat on the water I was 4 floors up and with all my windows closed and could still hear music and talking shouting Not sure if I was unlucky or this is a regular thing Generally the hotel was fine but I expected more for the money ,No Positive
271571,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Location service in restaurant Charge for luggage I stayed in Ibis in Centre night before as was visiting for a conference through work left my luggage all day for no charge even though I had checked out , Bit further out of town than we anticipated bit of a walk to get tram Renovations going on at the moment probably impacted on the overall experience Room was lovely newly decorated but still some finishing touches to address some loose wires in bathroom and light fittings at door of our room Extremely comfortable bed very clean only stayed 2 nights and had fresh towels and bedding after one night Breakfast a bit expensive so didn t bother but seems to be standard for Amsterdam Couldn t leave our luggage for just a couple of hours could only leave for 16 a day for each piece so too expensive for 2 hours Harbour Restaurant adjoining hotel was lovely but service was so so slow Had to ask for sugar and milk for our coffee On last day we waited half an hour for 2 sandwiches were lovely but we had to rush as we were getting shuttle to airport They re not busy but really need to up their game a bit just too relaxed Overall lovely hotel just a bit too far out though admittedly easy to reach everywhere within half an hour 
271572,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Staff were super welcoming and friendly nothing was too much trouble We were fitted in at last min when let down by somewhere else and we re so glad because the Apollo was excellent 
271573,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The noice from the renovation hotel is undergoing an overdue renovation the non renovated parts look like they are from the 80ies The double rooms are small there are hotels with larger rooms for the same price in the area The rooms are quite noisy you can actually hear your neighbours The harbour club restaurant in the hotel premises is a catastrophe bad service over priced and full of gold diggers , The view over the harbour Proximity to the city and congress center RAI
271574,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Amazing hotel booked for mums surprise birthday she was welcomed with a plate of goodies and a card and had a great stay Thank you for looking after her Apollo
271575,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, 1 I visited an exhibition in Amsterdam Rai and I preferred this hotel because of its location I wanted to stay in a canal view room but it was a complete dissapointment They gave us room 152 which is one of the worst rooms for canal view There are 2 trees in front of window and room located in the corner of the building which has more road view than a canal view 2 Heating system was not working you can t heat the room if central heating system s radiator is not working A C system is only a fan blowing air into the room Outside tempreature was 11 14 C which was cold for a Mediterranean person 3 Despite we informed the heating problem nothing happened during our 3 day stay 4 2nd day we returned to room at 21 30 7th June There was a minibar in the room which should have 2 bottles of water refreshment everyday but they were not there I called the room service to buy but room service didn t answer the phone Then I called the front desk and nobody answered as well Also same day towels and bathroom amentities were not refreshed either 5 In addition to above hotel building is an old building and requires a serious rennovation in front desk and elevators 6 There was a construction work in the ground floor they were building a new restaurant everywhere was full of workers dust and construction materials which should be informed prior booking , Restaurant staff was great Food and service quality of the restaurant is better than many restaurants in surrounding 
271576,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Construction throughout hotel during our stay Woken at 7 30am to builders drilling outside Would not have stayed here had we known construction going on Room was very small Poor value for money ,No Positive
271577,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The rooms were spacious and the bed was really comfortable The staff could not have been more helpful and were able to assist with tours as well The location was great we could walk everywhere and felt extremely safe 
271578,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, A large part of the common areas are under renovation Although they try to minimize the inconvenience it is impossible to avoid the unpleasant feeling of being on a working site Parking space is easily available but at 35 euro day it is probably the most expensive in Amsterdam , Good location on a beautiful canal and not far from the museums area Nice restaurant overlooking the canals 
271579,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, At present the hotel is undergoing reservations It didn t overly trouble us or guests It will be incredible I completion , The hotel was incredible The staff were lovely and knowledgeable Our room was lovely and the bed was so unbelievably comfortable We will definitely stay there again 
271580,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Staying at Apollo is always good in each detail from the room and services to tasty food It s not our first visit of this hotel and I hope not last one The only thing made a little bit of discomfort reconstruction of hotel But I know it s temporary and soon it ll be excellent as always 
271581,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, I was there during King s Day this year They are really convenient to the fashion district and a quick walk to the trams downtown The staff was great and the breakfast buffet offered with the room was really good too 
271582,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Unfortunately during my stay major reconstruction works were on going That was not mentioned on site prior my booking nor the price was reduced due to fact that half of the hotel was out of use for this works 25Eur for breakfast is quite high price , Hotel Apollo is great located venue with great potential I would specifically point to beautiful restaurant where breakfast can be truly enjoyed 
271583,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel is under construction BOOKING COM did not tell us this Our first day was marked with major construction right over our heads The lobby is almost non existent and the restaurant is accessed through temporary doors and walls Smoking is non stop right outside the hotel main doors and I suspect even in some rooms judging by our across the hall neighbors , very little 
271584,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, We were allocated a basement room with no view unless you climbed up a vertical ladder to the window seat and then there was a whopping great boat straight in front of the window This didn t set a good start especially at the price The full breakfast is very pricey too 22 euros pp and though we opted for a smaller breakfast 9euros and no one told us that this was only available as room service 10 euros per order we had it in the dining room and they added the room service to our bill which fortunately I picked up and got deleted This place is good but pricey , The staff especially Anand were really helpful Initially we had been allocated a poor room in the basement quite claustrophobic Anand pulled out all the stops to get another room cleaned and ready for use in 45 minutes Thank you He and other staff were very helpful in giving local information on public transport and places to go Thank you It s around 5 7 minutes walk of the number 5 tram which takes you into town 
271585,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel is in the process of renovation it seems so the grounds just look messy and unpleasant There s barely a reception area We got a room on the ground floor overlooking a construction garbage dump Room was alright but definitely not worth the price , Location was good close to restaurants and shops A biit difficult to reach with public transport though 
271586,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Renovation of the hotel was right behind our window and started early in the morning However a 20 compensation was suggested at check out Overall everything should be fine when the renovation is over , Staff was friendly The room was freshly renovated 
271587,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Repairs works, Personal is good Adminastrator helped me with my questions and manager gives me good room however most rooms with canal view were in repearing process 
271588,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel resteraunt food and Drink was very exspensive Staff could have been friendlier too would go back but wouldnt use resteraunt and bar as often, Good location 15min walk to museum quarter rooms modern and clean Although some work going on didnt have a big impact on our break 
271589,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel was unfortunately being renovated during our stay To it s defense it will become really nice once completed This was our 5th stay at this hotel The breakfast area was moved to the restaurant where they played way to high music Felt like I was sitting in a hard rock hotel This was mentioned to the staff with no results I like my breakfast in calm surroundings,No Positive
271590,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, I was disappointed by the construction renovation along the gangway that led to the Harbour Club Kitchen the breakfast place Even though I had reserved a room months in advance the hotel management neither mentioned nor apologized for this inconvenience drilling and hammering from really close Of course there was no effort to offer any compensation for this nuisance either even though I stayed for 4 nights , The hotel s location was good within 20 minutes walk to the museums The city center is farther I chose the location as a compromise because I wanted to walk both to the convention center RAI and around town 
271591,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, took an hour to check in hotel overbooked paid for an executive room with harbour view with twin beds we were allocated a room in the basement with a double bed you had to stand on a chair to look out of the window room below the level of the canal my wife wanted a room with bath we got a shower, not a lot
271592,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The renovations where unexpected and quite disruptive Surely there has to be a note somewhere when booking that advises if construction is happening , dinner was great breakfast average 
271593,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast staff seemed under pressure and grumpy with the exception of Fritz i think it was Fritz white haired man who was a lovely man , Comfortable well located good bar and restaurant Front of house staff were excellent particularly Dennis he needs a wage rise I think He helped us find a lovely place to eat was kind and courteous and above all he had a wonderful sense of humour 
271594,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Some of the staff do not know what they are doing There is a construction site right in front of the building which is very loud The parking place is very expensive and you are blocked in by the cars belonging to the workers And this for 35 eur day The hotel is very loud especially the doors , Location close to the public transport close to the center
271595,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel is under renovation currently and we weren t told of this by booking com This had a negative impact on our stay The air conditioning in the bedrooms couldn t be turned off or adjusted it was noisy and inefficient leading to a very warm dry atmosphere in the room and this kept us awake When we asked for it to be switched off we were told by staff it is an old system due to be updated when the rooms are renovated The area from reception to the restaurant is like walking through a building site most unpleasant , The harbour kitchen is a great restaurant buzzy atmosphere and great food The staff are very helpful 
271596,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, I remember having stayed at this hotel years back and it looks as if they are still carrying out the same refurbishing work that was then in progress I rate the restaurant as very average and expensive , The location was convenient The room was comfortable and clean The view from the room decent we were on a higher floor 
271597,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The building site several areas of the hotel were boarded up particularly the reception area which felt cramped and dark The price as breakfast was not included and half the hotel was shut up the room rate felt rather steep , Lovely view over the canal basin nice location in walking distance of the RAI 
271598,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, A separate shower would have been preferable to the high sided bath for seniors at least Everything else was fine , I liked the location with lovely local canal walks possible Convenient to tram stop to museum and central city Not a lot of local restaurants but maybe that was because of Easter holiday Staff helpful and charming Wifi was easy and reliable 
271599,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel looks reasonably close to the centre of Amsterdam on a map however it is around over an hours walk from the station to the hotel The number 5 tram gets you from the city centre to nearby the hotel ,No Positive
271600,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Expensive scaffolding no working wifi cannot turn on bath without shower leaking no minibar odd area of town only good for exhibition centre , Close to the rai exhibition centre Quiet rooms Bath tub Window in room opens Lovely front desk staff 
271601,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Its a conference hotel so lots of room and signage not as clear as it could be and a few stairs to go up and down without lifts porter assistance Limited wardrobe space but that s a common problem Catering OK but they had some staff shortages no real complaint but the selection service they provided I feel ought to have impressed me more than it did TV seemed a little small, Lots of pillows big bed a functional executive room Quiet area reasonably convenient for art galleries not so much for the centre of town and station but that suited me Convenient reasonably priced shuttle to the airport about 25 minutes Friendly staff Wifi throughout the hotel
271602,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Basicaly i can t say that i did not like something because in total i stay maybe 5 hours in the hotel So it was really good I will deffinetly come back , That small lake near the hotel Staff were really good in customer service always smile I love the bar The furniture it was really really nice I was staying for few beers at the bar and i had time to analyse it That massive wood You all do great jobs Thank you
271603,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel offers bicycles but fee is quite high They also offer transfers to from the airport BUT they operate only till 17 00 Location about 45 50 min walk from the central train station or 25 30 min by tram, Very nice hotel large rooms In the room I had a small refrigerator bathrobe slippers iron bed for ironing all was very useful Absolutely great and rich breakfast with wonderful view large windows to the channels Nice area very quiet supermarkets are in about 10 min walking distance 
271604,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Our room was at the ground floor near the elevator it was so noisy in the midnight when the guests back to hotel after their night out and the hotel staffs worked early in the morning made the noises to wake me up every day , The room was clean and tidy 
271605,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, When we booked a harbour view room we did not expect the road gas station a small bit of harbour view , The location of the property close to main attractions and public transport in cosy and quiet neighbourhood 
271606,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, I arrived by car yet the parking at the hotel itself was quite expensive around 35 euro per day Quality of the beds was not great I ve had better experiences for less money in the past Room has a nice view on the waterfront but the interior design is quite dated with some very crude retouches in some places e g doorhandle fixed with some very obvious yellow Patex glue , Very nice and helpful reception staff who even gave us some great tips of little known less touristic places You can rent bikes at the hotel which saves you the trouble of looking for a rental place The hotel is very close to the city centre and thus just a very short bikeride away from all the touristic locations 
271607,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Very nice room with a view of the canal and a nice en suite bathroom The bed in the room was very comfortable Very good choice of breakfast and both the hot and cold options were delicious The hotel is within walking distance of the museum quarter about 15 mins but a bit further from the city centre than we would have liked although public transport takes you there quite quickly 
271608,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, We were unable to sit in the restaurabt one morning after we missed breakfast but just wanted to perhaps get a drink or something light while we planned the day rather than being in our room to do this , A beautifully designed hotel Good location between business area and city centre If you don t mind travelling to and from dam square via tram The staff were amazingly friendly very helpful 
271609,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, No negatives , The location was great Bus stop outside property gate bikes available to rent and within walking distance of many restaurants and shops 
271610,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, This hotel is in a residential section pretty far from Amsterdam city center The nearest pub we found open was a 15 minute walk away Then old city center was a 25 minute tram ride away from there I would not stay here again , Nice hotel that was under renovation when we were there so a lot of construction going on 
271611,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, My key cards de magnetised 5 times in 48 hours and I had to trek all the way back to reception each time to be quizzed as to who I was and why was I trying to get into my room No I don t keep the key cards next to my phone No I m not mildly radioactive maybe it s just that your key cards are not fully fit for purpose , Airport shuttle is fantastic Cheaper and less hassle than the train from airport to Centraal station and way better than the 50 taxi ride in rush hour traffic that followed Didn t find out about this until I had arrived Gutted 
271612,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Tea and coffee were available in the room but no small snacks such as biscuits Very difficult to get TV to work in room 139 and couldn t find how to turn on radiator Instructions for both would be helpful Breakfast was so expensive we only had one , Great staff who went out of their way to be helpful when I left my wallet in a taxi Spacious room large comfortable bed plenty of storage room Good to have shuttle vehicle to airport Nice quiet location 
271613,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Extensive renovation going on Building noise during the day Canal side bar and balcony and restaurant was closed The one bar open had a DJ playing non stop Ibiza night club music when their were just the two pensioners of us there Due to the renovations there is only one extremely expensive restaurant open forcing us to go out to eat We booked this stay last November having been several times before However we were not informed at that time about the change of ownership and the new owner s plans to refit the whole place My complaint to the management fell on deaf ears , Location Close half mile to shopping cafes and a mile or so to the museum quarter 
271614,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The food at the restaurant wasnt particularly good and I felt I paid too much for our meal , The staff were excellent As it was my birthday the 2nd day we were there one of the staff members brought up a birthday card and a plate of mini cakes and chocolate I felt so greatful towards them it made my stay even more special 
271615,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, I wish there was a Spa or a Sauna , The hotel staff were amazing Nothing was a problem The rooms were very nice and modern and were extremely comfortable 
271616,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, I requested a large bed when I booked but we got twin beds pushed together Not my idea of what a large bed should be , We were surprised how quiet the location of the Apollo Hotel was We had two very restful night s sleep The canal view from our room was also very pleasant 
271617,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, have to say that so disappointed with the housekeeping we put the dirty towel on the bathroom ground after that the housekeeper organized the dirty towel back on the handle instead of putting the clean towel it is really disgraced for a four star hotel , The reception providing the warmest welcoming and give us two wine glass when we asking for a corkscrew 
271618,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Unaware of Building works Car parking prices are well hidden in your micro print and excessive There was a constant noise form the Air Con which didn t go away even when turned off in room 54 , Nice room Ace staff 
271619,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Inside building a lot of areas were under construction I could not imagine what was the original view of the hotel , A bit away from center but hotel parking is available inside room is not new but well tidy up From room I could enjoy the view of canal Restaurant was OK all staffs were enough kind and quick Sushi was also acceptable level 
271620,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The beds are too soft it was hard to get a good nights sleep the staff can be a bit rude and I think our aircon was broken as the bedroom was very hot at night , The hotel itself is beautiful rooms are spacious and the canal view from the restaurant is lovely 
271621,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Really nice hotel with great location Just returned from a 3 night stay really enjoyed the Apollo Hotel The rooms are spacious with complimentary water in mini bar bathrobes provided The beds are comfortable both bedroom bathroom are well equipped From this hotel it is only a short walk to museum quarter the number 5 tram just up the street from hotel brings you straight to Dam Square Highly recommend and if I return to Amsterdam I will stay here again Helpful friendly staff 
271622,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast and dry cleaning services too expensive 6 per item for laundry , Staff were friendly and extremely helpful in terms of directions Cleanliness superb 
271623,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The staff didn t care much about anything I called for info and got the run around quite a bit When I told them about it at checkout they didn t seem to care much then either , Nice location nice rooms 
271624,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Not keen on the pillows as we prefer flatter ones but that is just personal preference , The room was comfortable and clean The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful The breakfast was substantial with plenty of variety 
271625,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel currently undergoes some renovations which makes it appear slight messy though temporary Some renewals could be made e g lift or carpets , Convenient location friendly and very efficient staff sizeable and fully functional rooms nice restaurant with high quality dishes Very nice and well priced airport shuttle bus with friendly driver 
271626,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Night manager and night staff very rude Door was knocked on at 2 17am and the night manager and night security demanded to enter our room after reportedly smelling weed outside the room Came in and myself and wife were more or less naked Not happy at all and will be complaining to the hotel head office , Room was comfortable Good service in bar Good food in restaurant Manager dealt with complaint
271627,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, On arrival our reservation could not be found we are not sure which party is to blame here which meant we had to make a new one Luckily the hotel was not fully booked otherwise there would have been a problem The hotel was also in the process of a major renovation project which meant the main bar and reception area were not in use If we had known about this we probably wouldn t have booked a room here The room had a leaking shower and the hairdryer was faulty Although a replacement hairdryer was supplied it s cord was so short it couldn t be used in front of a mirror The shower was still faulty when we checked out , The reception staff were friendly and helpful with good intentions 
271628,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Did not have my room ready at check in time and they wanted to give another room Its unprofessional to say well we can give you another room and weve been waiting to check in from 1 till 3 and they still did not have it ready nor offer early to give us a room, Room was clean
271629,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Location bit far from old quarter tram is five minute walk Good news tram runs really frequently , We were greeted by friendly staff who were extremely helpful Provided map of the area telling us where to find places of interest Gave us unexpected upgrade to room 
271630,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The vending machine within the hotel was very expensive and also the cost for room service was as well , We ordered a takeaway and reception sent them up to our room so we didn t even have to move 
271631,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Had to pay a deposit which isn t a problem but wasn t stated anywhere on my booking confirmation I liked to know these things before I arrive , This was a lovely hotel staff were welcoming friendly and very willing to help The Hitel itself is lovely and In a great location just outside the centre 
271632,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, While set in a quiet location in the south of the city it was just a short tram ride or 15 minute walk away from the Museum district Lovely very helpful staff We ll be back and would recommend this hotel if you re looking for a relaxing weekend break 
271633,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Was very impressed by the size of the rooms as well as hotel overall Facilities were clean and comfortable Location was great quick walk to transit but nice to not be in the hectic city center Also great views of the city from our room 
271634,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff were great especially Leanne she was friendly extremely helpful with regards to the map navigating and even left a card and cakes in the room on my birthday Above and beyond Thank you 
271635,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The location is best for business rather than for journeying into the central city Be prepared to walk or take a taxi into town or the train station The shuttle for the airport is also infrequent so we had to take a taxi Be careful of their connecting restaurant The Harbour Kitchen it s connected to the hotel but is its own thing and a terrible value , Super great breakfast that was also a great value The hotel had a nice gym and the whole hotel was nicely furnished and maintained The room itself was a good size and it was really nice to enjoy a bath after a long day out Great value for the price and the staff was always willing to help out 
271636,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Think there may have been a miscommunication between staff and booking com about payment method , Great hotel with friendly staff and clean and comfortable rooms Ideal location in the museum district
271637,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Something is missing in the shower For older people like me it s dangerious because their is not inside the douche how to hold your self something has to be changed with the shuttle service The time table has to take in consideration of the trafic in order to be on time at the airport , the welcome smile of the staff Very efficient and professional The restaurant envirenment is very romantic and nice The menu the presentation and the taste are excellent The price per night was fair 
271638,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The location is close to everything if you have a car but if you are relying on public transport then it generally takes at least 5 10 minutes walk, Spacios room with a canal view Professional and helpful staff and conceirge Booked a standard room but was upgraded to higher tier 
271639,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Transfer shuttle from the airport to hotel only goes at certain hours so we had to make our own way to and from the airport, The location was good the staff were friendly and the rooms were nice we had a good view of the canal 
271640,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff were really helpful with how to get around finding best trams to use good information about all tourist attraction etc there was a little restaurant down stairs good food beverages and lovely outlook over looking the canals lovely warm fire 
271641,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, We asked before arrival for a room with a bath tub as it shows you in the pictures of the room on their website we received a room with no bath tub The room was cold the heater in the room blew out cold air only even when turned up to the max setting of 30 The radiator in the room was located in front of the full length window and the curtains closed in front of the radiator meaning we had no heat at all in the room with the curtains closed I understand it was cold outside but it was uncomfortably cold in the room at any point of the day or night The walls were paper thin it felt like we came to this hotel for a relaxing break away as my partner was 25 weeks pregnant when we arrived for our stay We were awoken throughout the night by a screaming baby on two nights of our stay in another room woken from people running down the hallway during the night and on our last morning the hotel had a cherry picker parked outside our window with its engine running from 8 25 a m making it impossible to get back to sleep after an already disturbed nights sleep no different to our three previous nights stay for a four star hotel i feel it lacked a level of class and professionalism people usually go on holiday to relax from their already busy and stressful lives we were unfortunately unable to do this whilst staying at the Wyndham Apollo Hotel Amsterdam I have stayed in 6 hotels in Amsterdam since 2010 and this was my worst experience here yet i would never stay here again The staff were polite and approachable but to call this a 4 star hotel seems a little insulting to the other 4 star hotels i have stayed in in Amsterdam I hope to hear back from someone at Apollo regarding my issues with my stay ,No Positive

271643,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The only complaint I could think of if I really think hard about it is the shower area where it s impossible to keep the bathroom dry A proper shower screen would have been good Breakfast was also rather pricey Formerly one could order just a croissant and a coffee but it was not possible during this stay , The room is rather spacious and super comfortable The rooms facing the water front has an excellent view The trams are also a stone throw away
271644,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The room itself was quite out dated but liveable But the bathroom was disgusting to say the least There was BLACK mold growing in between the tiles and dust in all corners even on the tissue dispenser The hairdryer which I believe was purchased in the 80 s did not work nor did the light in the small mirror , the staff were really nice and helpful 
271645,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, 1 It is not a 5 minute walk Really Have your staff do it with a suitcase or two Be more realistic and understand the distance Three different staff gave different routes to the hotel Consider standardizing your guest directions protocol and also consider the following stop on the tram 5 It is more of a straight line I suspect I am not the only guest that got lost Also the big white building Apollo House though large is dark at night 2 There are some little things that your staff needs to work on Attention to detail Concierge needs to explain things carefully and slowly and write legibly If the concierge is working on something and a guest walks up they should demonstrate their communication skills and acknowledge the guest especially after 30 seconds have elapsed 3 The shower needs a manual It is difficult for to know how to operate if the guest is not familiar with this type of not so universal type of shower 4 TV Also perhaps needs a manual or maybe the one in my room After turning on the tv the TV button needs to be pressed then something else 5 Telephones on the different floors need to have the number in which to contact the front desk labeled clearly 6 This is just my personal preference and opinion Don t have a staff meeting at the front desk Use a conference room It makes your check in process very intimidating for guest and raises questions If it seems like I am being nit picky then I apologize But I guarantee you this not paying attention to the small details is what causes hotels to fail because the guests do not return and in most cases they do not offer feedback, Easy check in check out Generally staff responsive to needs of guests Comfortable bed strong water pressure for shower when I finally got it to work very comfortable stay and room temperature easy to regulate Donna and other staff were polite Lots of channels on the TV in many languages

271672,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, My only beef was that the website says that the shuttle is available 24 hours a day When we got to the airport and looked for the shuttle we were told that it did not operate from 10 a m to 5 p m when most flights arrive which is a little frustrating If you are on an early flight or a late flight however be aware there is a free shuttle to the hotel from the airport They charge 7 euros good deal to take you back from the hotel to the airport , We spent Thanksgiving week 2016 here It is conveniently located about 3 4 mile from the Rijksmuseum There is a nice shopping area Beethovenstraadt with a few restaurants nearby The desk clerk upgraded us to a junior suite when we checked in I would suggest getting the quick breakfast in the bar 9 5 euros as opposed to the breakfast buffet unless you need a huge amount of food for breakfast expensive at 22 euros Nice place and we got a pretty good rate of around 100 night

271734,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The information about the free shuttle needs to be made clear I only knew about it after reading some reviews so when we landed at the airport we rushed over to the bus stand only to find out that the shuttle had stopped running an hr previous We had even contacted the hotel to let them know what time we were landing but there was no mention of the shuttle not running at that time, The views overlooking the canal s were excellent Also the bloke who checked us in was very friendly and informative They upgraded our room to a canal view for our 10th anniversary which was nice And they gave us a free shuttle back to the airport because of the issues with the shuttle from the airport
271735,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The breakfast for 10 could have included some juice tea or coffee , The hotel is situated at the meeting point of two canals and the cafe at the canal side is absolutely lovely The hotel is 1 5 km from Museumplein They also rent out cycles which is the best way to explore the city The rooms were spacious and comfortable and the staff extremely helpful 
271736,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, When we arrived at 20 00 on our first night to check in we were informed that significant damage had been caused to the first and second floors due to flooding and we would not be able to stay in the hotel for our first and possibly subsequent nights We were disappointed that this had not been communicated to us before we arrived The reception staff said they would arrange for us to stay at their partner hotel the Ramada and whilst we of course appreciated that we had a bed for the night this hotel was in a completely different part of the city a 20 euro taxi ride away On our first morning we had no idea if the Wyndham would be ready for our second night in the city and therefore had to pack up our things and leave our luggage in the left luggage facility at the Ramada to prevent us being called back from exploring the city later that day in the case that our room was ready and we had to check out the Ramada As it happened our room was ready later that day and we stayed in the Wyndham for three rather than four nights Rather bizarrely when we arrived at the Wyndham to check in none of the three staff on reception were aware of the significant damage that the flooding had caused to two floors leading my friend and I to wonder whether we had been victims of the hotel overbooking it was a busy weekend given that EuroPride was taking place By way of apology we were offered free breakfast I would rather have had a refund for the first night given that websites including Booking com advertised a night at the Ramada as cheaper than the Wyndham however we were told it was free breakfast or nothing so we did go on one morning I still feel let down that the hotel did not refund the night we lost especially given the time exploring the city we lost out on because of having to move between the hotels and the fact we paid for four nights but only stayed three , Comfy bed quiet location breakfasts were okay pleasant views of the canal 
271737,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Rooms didn t have canal view Elevator very old and slow No bellboy to help us with the luggage Shuttle bus to the airport on weekend starts at 10 45 which is very inconvenient Although we placed do not disturb sign on the door housekeeping still entered the room and cleaned it , They offered complimentary water Restaurant has a beautiful view 
271738,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Concierge not available we had to take the luggage ourselves and we had child with us , Love the location quiet and peaceful Great hotel Amazing views Very clean and awesome
271739,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Beautiful view overlooking river close walking distdise to restaurants concierge got tickets to attractions with ease Bikes available to rent from hotel Shuttle and taxi services also provided 
271740,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, All was good No complaints from me , Lovely position right on a canal Amazing buffet breakfast Really comfortable room Not far from tram stop to get into the heart of the city Very helpful friendly staff 
271741,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing It might be a bit far out of town for some people but a 10 minute walk took us to a tram stop with frequent trams to the centre journey took 15 minutes , This is an outstanding hotel is a great setting with a canal passing by the bar and restaurant at the back 
271742,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, My husband had called ahead to try upgrade us to a room with a view or on the water or something special as I was travelling with my sister from Canada first time to Amsterdam for her and her 50th birthday so this was a birthday gift My husband s request was relayed to the hotel but not evidently not listened to by hotel management or reception , Room was good view of the car park not the best Hotel facilities were excellent Location is perfect 
271743,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Although the beds were really comfy every morning we were woken up by deliveries or what sounded like building work It really was so so loud We were on the top floor too so that tells you how bad it was It meant we didn t get much sleep at all The wifi also didn t work at all the whole time we were there so I had to pay for extra data the whole time Really annoying The website also says there s a tramp stop on the doorstep of the hotel we decided this was false advertising as the tram stop is a good 10 minute walk away and not easy to find the first time, The staff in reception were amazing he gave us a map and told us all the places he recommended going on out first night which was so helpful 
271744,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Rooms quite a bit out of date Internet was slow as well Breakfast was really expensive Better walk about 5 min to get organic breakfast at Le Pain Quotidien and twice is cheaper waiter who was serving the breakfast was a bit rude as well Lady at the bar who service lunch needs to smile more and be a bit more welcome , Location on the canal View at night was beautiful 
271745,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel restaurant is very expensive Slow service But nice patio at the restaurant , Enjoyed the room with a balcony Clean rooms Well maintained Great location on the convergence of the canals Close to restaurants and public transit Quiet 
271746,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, As I stayed for several days 6 nights by the time I checkout I would have like laundry facilities that I could have used myself the laundry service provided is very expensive Perhaps an alternative could be to offer wash and dry service ironed or not ironed that is priced by bundle and not individual item charges , Brilliant staff helpful cheerful polite
271747,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, I didn t like First room on ground floor air conditioning not working lights in bathroom not working No clear communication of opening closing hours for food drink Different prices for food drink depending upon which restaurant or bar you were in Being sent to another bar to get a drink because one bar didn t have a bottle in at the time Being told that I couldn t walk through the restaurant with my briefcase and I had to go in through the hotel entrance Being told that I shouldn t take my coffee in a china cup out of breakfast and I should use the paper one and so on Basically whilst the staff were pleasant the hotel seemed to be run for it s own convenience rather than guests ,No Positive
271748,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The location is about 15 mins walking from museumkliene and about a tram ride away from dam square Not exactly in the heart of the city , It s a great property very clean and good facilities Location is by the canal so you could have a meal at one of their fantastic restaurants The staff is extremely warm friendly and helpful
271749,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing , All the staff were very friendly Rooms were modern and spacious we got a room with a view of the canal Good location within walking distance of the Museum Quarter We did walk to the centre on several ocassion but it s a bit of a trek not a problem on a sunny day as it s a scenic walk along the canal Otherwise taxis are between 9 16 euro depending on area time of day We got the free airport shuttle to the hotel which was great but a taxi back due to flight time Taxi was 45 Would definitely recommend and would stay again 
271750,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, I didn t like the price of the laundry service We spent almost 200 on 4 days of clothes for 2 people 8 pants 8 shirts and underwear , The room was lovely It overlooked a canal and was new and clean The breakfast was EXCELLENT Totally worth the price 
271751,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Shuttle bus on last day was late Had to take a taxi in the end to Schipol Taxi driver knew that the bus was always late Would have been good to tell the customers as I would have booked a taxi earlier Taxi was 50 euros,No Positive
271752,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Someone s shaved hair on bed clothes which meant a visit by housekeeping at 11pm A broken phone in my room so call to reception were not possible I had to use the other room I booked grrr Breakfast at 22 per person Everything you buy in the hotel is not good value for money 88 for breakfast is not good but it gave us the opportunity to head out and explore some great bakeries , Location is great as we liked to walk to main attractions Generally about 15 20mins walk 
271753,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, My husband and I loved the Wyndham Apollo The staff were wonderful Our room was extremely comfortable The position of the hotel on the canals was fabulous The breakfast was great We will definitely stay here again 
271754,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Everything was perfect except the extra fee city tax that you find out about at the hotel there was not mention of that when we booked the room 
271755,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Rust stains on carpet and room service never changed the sheets comforter and we stayed for a week , Fabulous location to museums and restaurants Renting a bike was easy and convenient which made getting around Amsterdam a breeze Staff was attentive and answered all of our questions 
271756,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, There were a number of small defects in the room The bottom of the toilet bowl was discolored The light in the face mirror didn t work There was no telephone instrument in the room There was a loose floor tile in the bathroom There was smoking on the terrace and smoke drifted into the lobby through a constantly open door The walk to the tram was almost 15 min , The hotel was relatively luxurious especially for the price and proximity to downtown Amsterdam The room was fairly spacious with modern fixtures and a small fridge 
271757,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, We had some minor wifi problems wifi in our bedroom was not working accept when we were standing next to the entrance door but as soon as we have mentioned it it might has been a problem with our devices we are not sure we received a room upgrade free of charge Staff changed this slightly negative thing into a hugely positive thing with fast wifi , Everything nice new very clean beautiful Staff was excellent Location is not in the city centre but it is in a beautiful quiet neighbourhood Renting a bike from the hotel was a great idea because in no time you are in the city centre Vondelspark or wherever you want 
271758,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Though it was presented as having a view on a canal our view was actually on a gym that looked like a factory The sink was blocked and the bathtub didn t have a plug repaired after complaint Way too expensive for what they deliver , Good location outside the busy center but not too far away and near the museum district Easy to get there by Tram 5 Friendly staff 
271759,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Access to some rooms on the ground level is via staircase only if you have trouble walking be sure not to book those , Great rooms with patio Mice location Friendly staff very clean
271760,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, We did try to get an evening meal but a big group of people arrived so we couldn t get in We had to have a snack in the bar , The room was very clean and the beds were very comfortable Sitting in the lounge the views were beautiful 
271761,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Some of the furniture in the room and also the windows looked old or a bit worn out There was a problem with the shower A puddle of water was forming on the bathroom s floor every time the shower was used The mini bar contained only two small bottles of water , A nice view over the canal from the terrace restaurant and the room we booked Helpful staff Very good breakfast with many options to choose from The hotel looks very nice in general 
271762,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, 1 WiFi in room was inconsistent 2 TUB WAS VERY SLIPPERY The grab bar for showering should be higher 3 Hotel did not reply my message for shuttle from the airport , Didn t have breakfast there 
271763,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The safe was not working BUT fixed after 2 days The bathroom had mold in the corners but otherwise clean The air conditioning did not appear to work very well The maid did not renew the coffee and water each day, THEHOTEL LOCATION AND VIEW FROM OUR ROOM WAS SUPBERB The staff were very polite and helpful
271764,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, We are pretty happy with everything and was really happy during our stay For people who wants hard bed might want check again , It is a very nice hotel and not so far from all the sites Will stay again 
271765,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The room was comfortable The restaurants fabulous Ridiculous charge for an across town phone call No need to charge for every small thing It should be beneath you 
271766,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Thought breakfast was overpriced but don t let that put you off , Great hotel with friendly staff to meet us Great view of canal from hotels bar terrace Ultra modern and clean Only a 5min walk to catch the tram into the heart of Amsterdam Would definitely stay again
271767,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, We thought the restaurant and bars were very overpriced and the staff a little arrogant we were given incorrect information relating to tickets purchased also the climate control system was quite noisy in our room we stayed 3 nights which was possibly too long , We enjoyed the location being both quiet and canal side the rooms were nice and well maintained
271768,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Staff gave me a key to an occupied room Then they misspelled my name and then they gave me a key that didn t work Breakfast is super expensive and not worthy at all , Location and View
271769,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Pre ordered a cot for our baby boy which wasn t in the room upon checkout Took forever for one to arrive Check in staff particularly slow and uninterested in customers , Rooms modern and clean
271770,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, I ordered twin beds well in advance 3 weeks before arrival instead of that got one double bed At the reception I was told that it was impossible to change anything at that moment Good for us they could arrange an additional bed for free, Location is good although not right in the city center
271771,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Staff not particularly attentive Strikingly less professional than what I would expect from a four star hotel Breakfast quality not great Room a bit dated, Suite with canal view has wonderful connectivity with the water and small harbor through big sliding window 
271772,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, price for the parking lot I would like to see a much more reduced tariff given that I spend money to stay in the hotel in the first place , Nice restaurant and terrace
271773,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel quite a walk to nearest trams to the centre and some attractions Very few nice bars restaurants in the immediate vicinity , Very clean hotel with good facilities A good selection of food for breakfast Staff really friendly and helpful Regular shuttle service between airport and hotel 
271774,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, It s time for the rooms to be refurbished Quite far from the centre , Extremely helpful and nice staff Amazing view from the hotel bar Great breakfast 
271775,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Sound proofing wasn t up to modern standards and the air conditioning was so loud I had to turn it off again, View over the canal was lovely the bar ideally situated to maximise this
271776,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Not much choice for guest on gluten Free diet Room not very sound proofed as we were awaken several times by late guests , Good choice of breakfast for people on normal diet Spacious bedroom and very comfortable bed very clean room bathroom 
271777,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing really to complain about maybe just that unfortunately the parking is not part of the room offer and it is a bit expensive , The room was elegant and well furnished with a wonderful view on the channels The bed was comfortable and the bathroom modern The staff was professional and nice Do not miss to take a drink on the terrace 
271778,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The reason the hotel was chosen was the convenience and availability of the shuttle bus but one either had to leave no later than 9 30am or late in the afternoon to take the shuttle which did not suit us Staff explained how to take a bus and or tram to Amsterdam South railway station then a train to airport which worked out well The formal Kitchen Restaurant was a disappointment as we could not see a menu before entering and when seated found the choices to be mostly expensive seafood oysters and sushi and a very limited choice of other dishes Loud mindless music was also being played so we left and ate in the more casual area A warning the slate tiles near the kitchen of the Restaurant are very slippery I almost slipped twice and some maintenance is required , We had just completed a cruise and arrived at reception 10 00am thinking we would have to wait for a room but we were given a room straight away which was a bonus Reception staff were very helpful and friendly Tessa who had only been working at the hotel 1 week Room overlooked one of the canals and was quiet roomy and comfortable Loved the speedy free wi fi nice bathroom and comfortable bed Late book out at 12 noon was also appreciated although we checked out 10 45am to reach the airport in time Buffet breakfast was fantastic and reasonable value Taking the public transport tram to the city was easy to use and convenient although the weekend we were staying there was tram maintenance on the lines and the No 5 tram took a detour but this gave us a further look at Amsterdam The hotel is situated in a very nice area of Amsterdam and although further from the CBD than many other places this was not a problem 
271779,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Room was cleaned but could be paid more attention e g body lotion was already used Thin wall Need to walk a bit to the nearest tram station , cozy bar and terrace free drink voucher
271780,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, 1 Hotel blocked money for accommodation on my creditcard and still has not returned While I settled on time Almost a month has past from my check out 2 Far from the city center, Nice view from the room Good restaurant
271781,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Room too hot unable to cool so had bad sleep Also access to room required negotiating several steep steps very difficult with suitcase Main resturant not open for dinner on night we stayed so not able to sample , Location great with excellent view of waterways Good buffet breakfast but at an additional cost of 22 50 per person 
271782,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast was too expensive and the bar prices were high, clean comfortable hotel with helpful staff A great place to say that is relatively central and well priced 
271783,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing it was lovely , I booked the Executive Room and at check in the staff upgraded me to a room with a canal view which was lovely Hotel lobby was very inviting room was very clean staff are very pleasant breakfast is great a little pricy though fantastic location with very easy access to the centre It a 40 45 min walk to Dam Square which takes you through the museum square or 30 min tram journey on Route 5 including the 5 mins walk to the tram stop closest to the hotel 
271784,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Noisewise should be little bit better You can hear everthying in corridor and especialy flushing the toilet from your neighbors Amazingly noise , Very nice hotel Located little outskirt from center however nearby good restaurants and coffee shops 
271785,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, We were travelling with my sister who has had 2 strokes and walked with a cane but were offered no help in getting to our room The room was extremely hot and we and adjusted the controls but it did not cool off and the second day someone came up from the front desk and couldn t control it but gave us a fan pretty poor for what we were charged We went for Dinner on our second nite and sat there for 20 mins and no one came to our table so we left and went to the Lounge where we served our drinks so I eventually went to the bar and ordered our Dinner The fellow was working alone and we were terribly disappointed in our meal I had Lobster Bisque which was left over dishwater with 4 small bits of lobster good way to loose weight I was very unimpressed They didn t charge us for the trip to the Airport but think about it This was a trip that we were looking forward to but this ruined it 
271786,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The room position The hotel is situated on the junction of 5 canals with balcony rooms ours had no balcony and overlooked the car park and we couldn t be moved On that basis we felt the price was expensive ,No Positive
271787,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Pillows are too small they are more like cushions , The hotel is very well situated over looking a number of canals Beautiful view from the restaurant and bedroom 
271788,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Staff were exceptional upgraded to a large room Food for breakfast excellent and dining options at restaurant in evening fantastic Highly recommend this property and would definitely return P s loved the location seeing the snow capped mountains from the property So so beautiful 
271789,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Servicing of rooms poor for the quality of the hotel One day of our two day stay only one bath towel was replaced and on the other no toileteries were replaced and tea bags not replaced Room for improvement in room servicing but front counter staff were excellent , Great location we had a canal view room Good reasonable priced restaurants close by Shuttle service to airport at reasonable price is handy and efficient Good quality accomodation huge king size bed and good size rooms 
271790,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, I think the parking fee is a bit too expensive , The staffs are friendly and helpful The room is quite comfortable and clean The internet is fast To the city center it s about 25 mins walk which is not so far 
271791,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The bar closed too early at 11pm but the barman would not serve us at 10 45pm We had to buy drinks from the disco bar instead which was very noisy and disrupted our quiet drink and chat with our family The barman was offhand and rude even though we were polite and pleasant to him Customer service skills here and with one of the reception staff needed improvement , The room was very clean tidy and had a large chair with foot rest a desk and chair television and great wet room We were upgraded and our room had patio doors which led to our own outside seating area with table and chairs There was an outside seating area from the main bar which overlooked the canal 
271792,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Honestly I would be knit picking but perhaps the air con needs an upgrade , Staff were probably the friendliest I ve ever encountered Always made to feel welcome 
271793,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Downside is that the restaurants are not in the immediate neighborhood However the staff were great about recommending an area with lots of very varied little restaurants on Scheldeplein ten minutes walk away so all was well , We got upgraded to a great suite with a glass wall overlooking the canals Was fantastic Great location for what we needed walking distance to RAI convention center and to the big museums
271794,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The only complaint would be the walking distance to the city centre and lack of attractions in close proximity , Room was comfortable front desk staff were very helpful Quiet location on a beautiful canal 
271795,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The selection in the restaurant wasn t great There wasn t much on offer for vegetarians , Great view if you can get a canal facing room The rooms are bigger than most in Amsterdam
271796,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Cleaning was not actually good black hairs in shower i am blond table from coffee was not cleaned for 3 days poor menu in restaurant nothing close to a hotel only Shell , Nice room good bed nice view from the window 
271797,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The breakfast was varied and good but rather expensive My friend had one poor vegetarian bar meal but it was when there was a large tour group being catered for , The room was warm spacious and comfortable We liked the position of the hotel next to canals The shuttle service to the airport was excellent with a friendly driver 
271798,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, My parents came to visit me in Amsterdam for a couple of days and stayed in this excellent hotel In a few words clean and fresh reliable and very nice staff rich breakfast for good value price Highly recommend this hotel 
271799,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, , The superb service and friendliness of all the staff Upon arrival our room was not available which was not an issue however I did explain that it was a special weekend our first holiday We were upgraded to a suite overlooking the canals and each day a number of complimentary treats were delivered to our room That s going the extra mile Leisurely breakfasts overlooking the canal were to die for and we were blessed with sunshine Dinner in the restaurant on Saturday night was delicious and it was good to see the Chefs at work creating their many dishes especially the sea food platters A special thanks also to the Concierge who organised a taxi to Eindhoven in order that we could get our early morning return flight at a bargain price A great weekend and I finally visited the land of Tulips 
271800,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The breakfast is overpriced I understand that 4 5 star hotels usually have a pricier buffet however there weren t many options available Also you can notice the hotel has received a facelift the decor is not fantastic , The restaurant bar decor is quite nice the room is comfortable and we got a nice view to the canal 
271801,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Bar was expensive and breakfast was very expensive Location was a little bit far out from the centre but once the trams were figured out it was actually easy to get around Make sure you know how to get there on your arrival , Hotel was clean modern and comfortable 
271802,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Was given complimentary drink on arrival and it was flat sparkling Bar very expensive , Liked the location away from frenetic city but eay to access all Room comfortable lovely view over canal Breakfast good
271803,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The locality was good and I ate at a nearby local beer cafe restaurant so didn t try the hotel food except for breakfast which not special was good BUT expensive , It had a good feel about it nicely situated on the junction of four canals with a boat club opposite The staff were fantastic It must be good as aircrew stay there 
271804,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The price of room service and the limitation on it was not great Phone was broken in the room so could not ring reception anyway The TV could not get any of the movie channels I booked a double room and got two single beds Need to make sure that you see that the city tax is payable on top of the price on booking com, Location for the conference centre was good and the wet room bathroom was excellent The bed was comfortable The flavoured water in reception was a nice touch 
271805,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast staff a little abrupt when we arrived ten minutes before opening time, Great room with excellent restaurant and bar facilities Views from bar and restaurant over water were very relaxing
271806,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The pillows were small and too firm , The staff was excellent Our room had an amazing canal view It was recently updated and very clean There are many restaurants within a ten minute walk but we found the best food on our 1 week stay in Amsterdam was at the Kitchen restaurant within the Wyndham hotel facility Their food was outstanding 
271807,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Our bathroom especially the shower wasn t clean right from when we arrived There was mould in the shower which was more then off putting , The staff were great and very friendly and extremely helpful 
271808,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing I can think of , The staff were so friendly and helpful We d planned on eating out the first night but the bar menu looked so good we decided to eat in and we weren t disappointed Even the prices of the gifts were reasonable And I spent much more on our stay in Amsterdam not because it was expensive but because everything seemed so reasonable We d very happily go back again and would definitely consider the Wyndham Apollo for our next trip Might seem a little out of the city centre but it s only about a 10 minute walk to catch a tram which are excellent and excellent value and only about 20 minutes by tram to get right into the city 
271809,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The room was utterly hot and the air was amazingly dry We tried to tweak the airco system but it didn t improve anything We then even called reception to send someone up to help us amend the climate of the room The guy who showed up to help mentioned that we shouldn t turn the AC high because since it was still on winter setting it would only make the room hotter which sounded weird to us but ok we tried After turning it off the temperature didn t seem to move eitiher We could slightly open the window but that didn t help either So in the end we woke up soaking wet of sweat and with a headache that didn t leave us till the end of the day For a hotel that is far from cheap one would expect more comfort on something relatively easy as regulating the climate Big miss , Located in a nice part of town also decent and clean facilities
271810,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Room keyreader broke up and that make us little unhappy Still we got nice room to Place it but in these cases usuallu customer is been taken care beter , Staff was nice Nice atmosphere 
271811,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, I couldn t believe they charged us EUR70 for two days parking EUR35 day where there was ample space around the hotel for their guests It reeks of profiteering via corporate customers with expense budgets and as tourists from abroad we felt a little taken advantage of and had wished we d simply parked next door or around the block etc We were also upgraded away from a double queen sized bed to two twins pushed together with duvets that could have been a little more generously sized , Relaxed dining area great food and a polite waiter Generally friendly and accommodating staff Easy to reach location from the main motorway Pleasant canal locale and a reasonable distance for walking into the inner city area 
271812,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Would have liked a bath the shower water made a lot of mess would have liked milk carton in room for my tea brought my own teabags as only lemon in room Overall would definitely stay here again , Very pleasant but would have liked a room higher we were in basement Restaurant was lovely great to see the chefs at work 
271813,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel was a little out of town but it was a quick taxi ride to everywhere we wanted to go to Buffet breakfast was very good but would have preferred to be served tea coffee rather than help yourself from a machine , The staff on reception including the concierge were exceptionally helpful nothing was too much trouble The rooms were comfortable and clean and of a good size Great walk in shower and toiletries were of a good standard 
271814,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, I have no negative comments , The hotel had a relaxed but efficient feel to it The reception staff were very helpful and informative eg what tours to go on travel tips and booking selected tours The variety of food on offer in the breakfast buffet was just right fruit hot cold food choices and a good selection of breads and pastries The room and bathroom were exceptionally clean modern comfortable and fully equipped The location of the hotel was far enough away from the busy centre but within easy access by tram or walking 
271815,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The only thing that works against is the price I suppose it could be cheaper , Ultra pleasant place to stay A quiet place modern and convinient rooms beautiful view on the chanels and professional stuff Only 30 minutes walk from the RLD and most of the museums Will defenetely recomend it to my friends and relatives 
271816,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, That I had to leave , Greeted by a manager who was incredibly welcoming and helpful Room was so clean it could ve been brand new Facilities we re brilliant Great location got around the whole of Amsterdam and back to the airport with ease Amazing value for money 10 10 would reccomend 
271817,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, the staff were extremely helpful and very friendly they helped us with locating places of interest on the city map told us the best ways to travel around the city and told us where we could by travel tickets etc i was allowed early check in and late check out to no extra cost we had a lovely room over looking the canals overall extremely happy with our stay we would recommend this hotel to anyone and we will be going back 
271818,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, One of the best locations in Amsterdam right on the junction of five canals Lovely views from the terraces and the better rooms Fantastic staff all of whom earn this hotel its star rating All stars in themselves Food was great and again the service was brilliant Shuttle bus to the airport is an extra bonus 
271819,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Water from outside the terrace flooded the carpet and this remained wet In all fairness we were offered another room which we refrained from taking due to the short remaining period , Staff were friendly
271820,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Parking prices are far to expensive 35 per day Regular breakfast price 22 50 relativly high for the offer, I got a free upgrade to a suite Discount offer on breakfast 15 x 3 Nice and valuable look and feel of hotel and room suite 
271821,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Finding your room in the building is something else The numbering of the rooms is really unnecessary complex My room on the ground floor was fine view of a blank wall was not something i expected but as i was there for work it didnt matter too much The breakfast offering is very disappointing for a hotel of this standing A very limited menu with everything based on a self service concept To be fair the cost does reflect this but it is not what i expected of a 4 star international hotel , Hotel as been nicely renovated by Wyndham Great location in relation to the RAI but even walking into town is really no problem Staff very friendly and efficient The Harbour Club are doing a great job in the bar and restaurant 
271822,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The staff are not friendly The bathroom flood was full of water Very expensive breakfast and taste bad A bottle of water cost you 4 Very far from the tram station Far from the city centre If you can t catch the last tram you need spend 50euro by taxi back to the hotel , nothing
271823,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The bar and restaurant was over priced for example for a Vodka Cranberry and a Gin Tonic it cost 26 Euros , The room was absolutely beautiful and very clean The staff were especially friends and helpful Tara was absolutely great and gave us everything we needed to know The views were unreal and looking over the canal was perfect The shuttle bus from Hotel Airport was also efficient and reliable 
271824,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The location was a bit too far from the nearest tram The walk of about 15mins was quite torturous especially in the cold, Bed was comfy but pillows were a little too soft View was super awesome as we got a free upgrade to an executive room Like the cleanliness of the room and the lovely room layout 
271825,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Only according my standards Little bit weak water stream The mattress are a bit soft, Highly recommended Beautiful view the hotel located on the canal and have a private quay The rooms are specious and fully equipped Close to tramp station 5 24 and bus station 65 and have shuttle to from air port Have nice park nearby
271826,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, I was check in first by myself and i didn t inform the staff that my another friend would be arriving later When my friend enter the room with a key i was quite surprise that I didn t receive any phone calls from the reception for verification reconfirm They just gave the room key to my friend I found it insecure that without clarifying or checking anything they just gave the key out , Price is good for a 4 property
271827,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Could need some refurbishment Feels a bit dated , A calm spot nearly like a resort hotel yet close to the city I was fortunate to receive an upgraded room with a view to the water but suspect regular rooms may not give the same feeling

271831,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast was a little dear but we got a rate on offer for valentines There isnt any thing else I didn t like , The staff were amazing From reception through to bar staff Views were fabulous if you are on the canal side Breakfast always a treat Great choices from smoked salmon and cheeses to good breads cereals fruits pastries and smoothies Loved the neighbourhood too it was safe and there were good shops and restaurants within walking distance Decor through the hotel was beautiful Just 10 minutes walk to main trams 
271832,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, I would ve liked if the hotel was closer to the center also the room we got seemed a bit out dated Like the 70 s or 80 s style , The bed was very comfortable after a long day of walking in the city Also the heating worked perfectly 
271833,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Poor service at the restaurant 10 m waiting for before someone stops and talks us gave us a table moving each time someone was walking nearbye High price breakfast 23 and diner 25 for just a burger 6 extra if you say yes to bread on the table Tiny gym room, Room are big comfortable and in good shape

271842,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Modern hotel with good bars and restaurants clean and well appointed room lovely corner aspect view of the canal basin outside Was initially a bit concerned about distance to town centre a good 3 4km but once we mastered the trams 5mins walk to the stop we realized access was easy and cheap and the museum district was only one stop away Minibus shuttle to the airport was great too 
271843,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Broken fosset sprayed water in all directions asked for fix and we were told someone would look at it but still wet bathroom rest of stay Our room was next to reception and f b so 10 room service charge seemed excessive and unclear if it is for staff or if it s for the hotel , Cozy rooms and deeply comfortable Bed and we received free upgrade for our honeymoon Great view in classic suite friendly reception manager resourceful concierge Breakfast buffet and hotel restaurant were both great room service also tasty Lovely little garden with pond in entrance and waterfront in other side is amazing

271846,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Only thing we weren t impressed with was the staff at the bar breakfast area On our departure day we went to get our complimentary drink but were quickly shoo s away because apparently the area was too busy there were 6 people on one table It was the way we felt we were just sort of pushed away so we didn t stay and just left The lady at the desk tried to sort it but we didn t really feel like staying afterwards Other then that we can t complain at all , The staff at the desk were really friendly and very helpful The rooms were lovely and clean and the beds extremely comfortable We very much enjoyed our stay and found it was very easy to get to by tram

271861,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast They already start to warn you way before 10h30 that the buffet will be closed at 10h30 In our opinion you should be able to walk in for breakfast until 10h30 and then still be able to enjoy your breakfast leisurely after all it is a very good breakfast , We regularly stay at the Wyndham Apollo it is a very nice hotel good location good comfortable rooms friendly staff 
271862,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, , Everything was just perfect Great location near center but still in a quite place Nice canal view Rooms are new comfortable Friendly staff

271873,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, I have worked in the hospitality industry for almost 15yrs and I have stayed in numerous Luxury chain of hotel alike such as the Ritz Jumeirah Marriot and I would say this hotel is at par and has a great value for money perfect view of the canals and best location We stayed there for 3 nights celebrating my daugther s 7th Birthday and they are kind enough to arrange a birthday card and some goodies for the kids I would sincerely send my appreciation to Ms Donna Front Office Manager who ensured our stay is comfy and well and Ms Em and Tatiana who checked us in Mr Fritz who is very lively and took care of breakfast every morning Mr Hasim the concierge and advised us the best places in Amsterdam that is well worth it to visit overall definitely we will come back to Amsterdam in spring and no doubt we will stay again in the Wyndham Apollo hotel this is like our home away from home hats off to the entire team

271876,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Very difficult to find the entrance of the hotel in the town when you don t know very well the area and when you join it alone on foot with public transportation by night discounts and or rebate were considered because I checked my bill and highligheted the point, wonderful room in the old building with view on the canal very nice very nice location and restaurant room with the view on the canal nice menu in the Bar to have dinner even a little late 21 00 and with reasonable prices 
271877,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The fact that when asking for a bucket of ice they tell me to come and fetch it Eventually they did send me ice in a paper cup , Breakfast was very nice with a good view However they could add fried eggs to their menu 
271878,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The gym was small and cramped with the equipment it had in it , The location was great Easy to get to on public transport plus within walking distance to a lot of the sights The breakfast was very good They had a special on for the week we were there so it was a reasonable price The dining room is comfortable and has a wonderful view of the canals The female cleaner who did our room was friendly and did a super job 
271879,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing, Lovely hotel clean good location staff are friendly and easy to park if you are driving They Listened to our request for a view and left a lovely note in the bedroom wishing us a nice anniversary Would highly recommend 5 mins to the tram but personally you can walk around Amsterdam quite comfortably

271881,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The instructions from the website sent us a 20 minute walk in the wrong direction This was a bit frustrating but the staff were so welcoming and helpful when we arrived that it was quickly forgotten ,No Positive
271882,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, A little way from the tourist sights , Great breakfast buffet and setting for the breakfast room over looking the canals My default choice when staying in Amsterdam 
271883,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, I had no bad experiences but wish I had been closer to the places I had to go and avoid some of the walking , The lobby bar and fireplace were cozy and the outside tables overlooking the canal are delightful 
271884,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, After a somewhat difficult travel day getting to Amsterdam the front desk staff was especially welcoming and helpful for our late arrival Also enjoyed walking the neighborhood the following morning 
271885,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The room heating was not working first room the offered was just looking to the aircondition cooling tower and room was too noisy the receptionist did not want to change the room and only accepted to change after my insist They were not helpfull also parking inside of hotel was expensive compare with the hotels location i dont recomend the standart rooms the locatoin of the rooms are not good, The restaurant breakfast and view from the lobby terrace
271886,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, I especially like the value for money this hotel offers Amsterdam is a quite expensive hotel city in Europe This hotel offers quality you can compare with many 5 star hotels in Amsterdam for a substantial lower price 
271887,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, no room service and to improve the rate of this hotel they have to provide the need of customers , the view was very nice but the window is not opening and they gave me room in the corner so it was hard to see all the view
271888,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The cleaners didn t replenish the tea milk or flannels and toiletries throughout our three night stay The breakfast was extortionate and not included as an offer with the stay , The location near the canal
271889,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Elevators were really slow Breakfast overpriced Service very uneven A late call from the front desk asking whether I had a hamburger and a beer at the bar I did not but had just fallen asleep , Some of the personnel is really great Bicycle rental 
271890,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, What can be improved The outside of the hotel is rundown so is the whole plastering of the parking area The outside appearance sharply contrasts with the inside , The location is relatively quiet For Amsterdam this hotel has good parking facilities and is easily accessible by car I had a room with a marvelous view on the canal crossing The public inside areas of the Hotel are clean and friendly with lots of space to sit 
271891,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The view of the canals from our room was spectacular Although some distance from the main centre of Amsterdam it was a pleasure staying in a hotel in such a pretty leafy suburb away from the tourist crowds 
271892,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Room location was below canal level although I originally requested an upper storey room Plumbing could be heard from room above every time toilet flush was used 10 mins walk to tram stop , Breakfast room location overlooking canals loved the terrace Good variety of breakfast food Shower 
271893,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing close to the hotel Supermarket and tram station are a 10 minute walk from the hotel , The rooms were extremely spacious We were upgraded to a canal view room by the friendly reception staff Every morning we woke up to see people rowing small boats and going past the canal which was indeed very beautiful Must stay at this hotel when I return to Amsterdam Free airport shuttle was very helpful 
271894,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, I asked for a room on a high floor a good view queen or double bed and room with no interconnecting door Guess what I got nothing that I asked for Room on level 1 overlooking front entrance and two twin beds pushed together , Quiet location with tram access to city centre Walk to tram is about 800m 
271895,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Booked an upstairs room online but given a downstairs room when we refused two single beds pushed together from the humourless receptionist Given a voucher for a free drink beware this only covered the tonic in a G and T we had to pay for the pricey gin A charge of 15 euros per 24 hours is made for TV channels internet and films so be careful before you log on The staff were functional and efficient if not friendly and we were not given any information about the hotel so unaware of bike hire or presence of a gym , Pleasant location out of town very good for the museums and being on the canals made for a pleasant ambience Shops and restaurants nearby Breakfast at a discounted rate 12 50 good and the ability to eat outside a welcome benefit Room on ground floor small but quiet and clean but still appeared to have two single mattresses 
271896,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Service staff at the front desk is poorly informed and under skilled Had issue with my payment and they have blocked the wrong value from my credit card as security deposit Upon check out the front office staff cannot provide correct information and have given me an incorrect information on the refundable security deposit I had to write to the duty managers and sent another email reminder to chase for explanation WiFi is not functioning and after a few complaints it was rectified but the issue continued I have inconsistent WiFi connection throughout my 4 days stay at this hotel The only good thing is I was given an upgrade on the room , Good value for money due to the promotional pricing on booking com
271897,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The only thing Id say is that the meals were very expensive 16 Euros for a burger and 6 for chips They were both delicious and of the best quality but for a family of 4 not to be repeated too often We were lucky that the breakfast was reduced for us from 22 Euros to 12 50 so we had that each morning and it was excellent with all you can imagine to eat which we did We have a small query re City Tax and VAT and the gym is too small but nothing too bad , A great hotel great staff and wonderful English spoken The Hotel sat on the 5 canals of Amsterdam and it was lovely seeing the boats barges and birds Rooms great and air con useful The team at the Apollo were wonderful generous and kind We were up graded to a bigger room a concierge gave us a travel pass for 2 days and we took the shuttle to the Air port for a small fee right to the departure doors Dutch people are uber cool how do they do it 
271898,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The staff who were there were very good but they definitely could have done with more staff serving at the bar bar food in evenings but that said the hotel was very busy because of the Sail Amsterdam festival and perhaps they weren t anticipating it would be quite as busy , Location was beautiful at the junction of the canals south of the main part of the old town but easy access and away from noise Breakfast on the terrace overlooking the water was a lovely way to start the day 
271899,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, n a, Nice location with a few Albert Heijn nice restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance The staff are very friendly and gave a lot of tips View from our room to the canal was fabulous 
271900,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The waiter was so slow I approached him to get service He told me that he was too busy and 10 minutes later threw one menu onto the table for my wife and me We were so annoyed we left without food and reported it to reception who apologised and were as helpful in finding an alternative restaurant as possible The external hotel was tired with weeds growing through the driveway Not up to your usual standards , Reception staff were friendly and helpful The room was clean and modern We hired bicycles which were useful 
271901,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Service was poor We were spending our wedding night and 2 more nights here We were told we had to check out our room everyday as the room was not available for the duration of our stay We checked in our wedding atire no one said congratulations My new husband requested flowers in the room but we didn t receive this When he mentioned something they send us a cheap bottle of champagne the next day We parked our car there and we had to pay 35 euro Wifi was terrible , Cleanliness
271902,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Broken power sockets rooms in need of refurbishment workmen outside of first floor window at 6 30 AM overcharged at checkout no room in parking lot , Nice breakfast area 
271903,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, It s pretty expensive for what you get They did give us a discount on the breakfast and we thought wow a 23 each breakfast for 12 50 aaand It was lovely truly was but with the price of the room it should have been included Room was nice enough but kinda small for 120 per night that far out of central area Food service was a bit slack, Staff Very lovely Was our first time and after a much longer than expected journey from Centraal Station we went to the wrong station durr we were greeted with a refreshingly friendly staff Dinner on the water was a treat 
271904,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, Shower floods because there is no proper curtain Location is not good for tourists It s a long tram ride plus a walk from the tram Most guests seem to be tour groups travelling by coach , Complimentary drinks very nice Friendly staff Nice room Quiet location 
271905,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, A bit noisy at night especially from the passing boats that set music out loud Quite far to nearest attractions such as Van Gogh museum Rijk Museum Heineken Museum etc , Cleanliness of the hotel many restaurant nearby Fantastic view toward canals 
271906,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, My friend and I requested 2 single beds which were overall comfortable since we re two relatively thin people However note that if you lean to much to either of its ends you might sink and fall off , Everything was great A very polite staff who are always willing to help out A good and clean room with fresh linen and facilities bath utilities tawels tea coffee which they ve renewed upon use etc 
271907,Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, The Bar was closed when we came back to the hotel around midnight would have been nice to be able to have a drink in the early hours of the morning , Location was perfect not too close to the city center and not too far We rented bikes from the hotel and they were very easy going with us bringing them back late Staff very friendly and helpful was upgraded to an executive room Really enjoyable stay
