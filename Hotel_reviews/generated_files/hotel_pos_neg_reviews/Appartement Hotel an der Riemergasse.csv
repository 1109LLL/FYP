430033,Appartement Hotel an der Riemergasse, I booked expecting an apartment hotel but it is really just a series of unrelated rooms apartments in a building It has none of the usual facilities such as a foyer bar cafe etc and each time we needed to contact reception it was a different very young person each of whom was very pleasant and obliging but there was no possibility of consistency or follow up On our second day we reported that the shower was not draining properly and we ended each shower with water up to our ankles which then took about fifteen minutes to drain away but nothing was done The internet service was interrupted without notice apparently for maintenance and the unit didn t have a DVD player as advertised when we first moved in Also the range of cooking utensils was fairly limited We had to be quite creative to get some meals cooked These aren t major problems and overall we did enjoy our stay , Location was excellent Second bathroom was very useful

430039,Appartement Hotel an der Riemergasse,No Negative, The staff at this hotel was the highlight of our stay We booked this last minute and it was double booked They were able to offer us a solution and they were incredibly apologetic about the whole situation for 2 days The place is nice and clean as well as tastefully decorated I would definitely stay there again It was a great location It was close to the center of action but far away enough to be on a quiet street 
430040,Appartement Hotel an der Riemergasse,No Negative, The apartment was in a terrific location in close proximity to St Stephans cathedral yet off of the main road so it was very quiet at night The apartment was very clean and it was so nice having it serviced everyday we appreciated that the apartment was cleaned daily and chocolates were left on our pillows We enjoyed our stay very much
