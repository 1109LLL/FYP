495020,Antares Hotel Accademia, Some of the staff are very poor I went down for Dinner on Wednesday night about 35 minutes before the advertised closing time I was told by a very rude bar maid black hair no name badge that she has other things to do and that if I wanted food then I should have came down earlier She also had the cheek to tell me that in Italy it is custom to offer to buy your host her a drink The receptionist appoligised for her saying that she has to leave early however from what I heard from other guests it was common for people to be told by her that she was too busy to serve them how has management not picked up on this Perhaps that explains why the restaurant always seemed to be empty The room was below what I would expect for a 4 star hotel the safe wasn t secured just lying in the wardrobe there were a few holes in the curtains and some dead insects flies and ants in the room The cleaner was friendly but seemed rushed off her feat You can get a better quality 3 star hotel closer to the city centre for slightly cheaper which is what I would recommend , The bed was very comfortable and a pleasure to sleep in Some of the staff were helpful and kind the young man at breakfast location is alright but not great for the city centre easiest way is to get the number 14 tram east side which seemed quicker than navigating through trains and subway The free Wi Fi is pretty fast and stable which was an advantage Breakfast while basic was good quality

495022,Antares Hotel Accademia, The shower was about as slippery as water on ice but we asked for a shower mat which the hotel provided the squishy rubberized type There were no grab bars either but I had inquired about handicapped accessibility before we booked so we were ready for this by traveling with a portable clamp on hand grip There was about an 8 inch step from the shower to the floor so we were doubly glad to have that Being almost 70 and my husband having Parkinson s Disease falling is a definite worry These conditions weren t peculiar to this hotel as we encountered the same at the 3 bed and breakfasts that we stayed at , The room was nice the bed comfortable and we appreciated that there was counter space next to the sink My husband lost his reading glasses somewhere so I told the front desk and they said they would watch out for them When we returned 3 days later the first thing they said without me even asking was that they didn t find them Good breakfast also

495030,Antares Hotel Accademia, There is no restaurant only take away items which is fine but there was no table or desk in the room and only one chair The room was not conducive for two people to relax in let alone eat The description of the hotel makes it sound a lot better than it is It wants to be a hip hotel but it just felt awkward and uncomfortable I was disappointed but at least it was inexpensive , The location was convenient since we had an early morning flight
