448686,Hotel Domizil, The rooms lack sound isolation so we were able to hear the people in the adjacent room all the time , Everything was perfect The hotel is centrally located and a walking distance from the city center The staff are simply amazing and extremely helpful The room was spacious very clean and comfortable 
448687,Hotel Domizil, Room very basic Needed to ask for things like iron and then had to pick up from reception , Accommadation was basic but location and breakfast was excellent Some staff were very helpful 
448688,Hotel Domizil, The toilet is separate to the bathroom without a sink so the thought of touching the door handles was a bit unappetizing , Friendly staff good breakfast Excellent location 
448689,Hotel Domizil, Construction go on on the street , Nice spacious room good breakfast great location near Stephane Dom parking costs 33euros per day unless you find parking on the streets nearby for 4euros I will definitely go back next time I m in Viena Good price 
448690,Hotel Domizil, The shower in our room was in an odd place , The breakfast was lovely with plenty of variety The bathroom was excellent with lovely toiletries Exceptional cleanliness 
448691,Hotel Domizil, The shower was an over the bath one which wouldn t be easy for an older person to get in and out of , Hotel Domizil is a classic but clean comfortable hotel right in the centre of Vienna old town It is in a narrow quiet street just off St Stephen Square and the metro station Places to visit and the main shopping streets are within short walking distance Staff are friendly cheerful and happy to help The air conditioning was very welcome as while there temperatures hit 33 degrees Breakfast room is clean and spacious Great variety of food including lovely fresh rolls pastries fruit yogurts cooked breakfast cold meat cheese and fruit juice Best hotel breakfast in a long time I would definitely recommend this hotel 
448692,Hotel Domizil, The rooms are pretty small and simple The breakfast was ok although the coffee could have been better Additionally if you live early before 7 you can only count on packed croissant seven days type and black filter coffee , A small hotel in a vary good location next to the u bahn in the middle of old town The stuff was vary nice and helpful 
448693,Hotel Domizil,No Negative, Perfect location in the centre of the city and in a quiet corner at the same time It s easily reachable by foot from the Wien mitte station when you arrive from the airport and is next to many interesting sights and restaurants The staff is very polite and welcoming i would like to thank especially Clara for being so nice and helpful to us in everything that we asked for always with a big smile The room was spacious with comfortable bed and pillows and the breakfast was great Overall an excellent choice and can t wait to visit you again 
448694,Hotel Domizil, Everything was great , The hotel is located very close to Cathedral Wonderful breakfast and helpful staff indeed as I had read in fact For the first time I am pretty sure that I will be back soon Thank you 
448695,Hotel Domizil, Unfortunately the surrounding road of the hotel was under maintaining thanks for changing our room to a quieter one I wish when I come to here next time the road are finished , Nothing to complain The room is clean and the staff are kind and polite 
448696,Hotel Domizil, Road works are just under your windows which start about 7am on working days but it is not Domizil hotel fault at all and they say about it in the hotel description All you need to do is to close windows and turn on air conditioning so it to become bearable Rooms are poorly decorated I would like a painting or something on its empty walls But again it has nothing to do with comfort , The hotel is situated wonderfully St Stephan s Cathedral is just around the corner but there is no crowds Metro station and railway station is just 5 10 minutes walk away The personnel is really friendly and helpful Breakfast is nice though I would like to have more vegetable or salad leaves 
448697,Hotel Domizil, Internet doesn t work It doesn t look as a 4 stars hotel The Coffee was realy awful and it is very expensive for the facilities it has it looks really old Our room was in another building and to get there we had to get an old elevador open a door go up one floor by stairs open another door and then enter to the room , Only the location 
448698,Hotel Domizil, Very noisy room but due to woad works which should be over with in June 2017 Using the hotel for business and work requires that the hight of the chair matches the table and it did not Therefore not easy to work at the desk ,No Positive
448699,Hotel Domizil, The ventilation in the toilet and the bathroom was very noisy It would be more comfortable if the ventilation can be turned on and off independently from the lighting , It was a corner room and had many big windows The bed was comfortable The breakfast was good 
448700,Hotel Domizil, The bedrooms need a bit of renovation It was hard to open the door with the heavy brass key you turn right three times to open it The lift would not respond immediately The wifi was not fast I found this difficult whenever I needed to contact my family back in the PH , The FEMALE receptionist was lovely Coming from a train from Salzburg she I forgot her name greeted us with a cheerful attitude The closet in our room had a lot of useful compartments This hotel is near Stephanplatz When you turn left on the street the hotel is located you will be shocked to immediately see Stephan s Church you can climb the narrow tower but it will be quite a journey more than 300 steps 4 euros for an adult The Spanish Riding School is less than 10 minutes by foot from there you can walk straight to the Museum Quarter less than 10 minutes also You will see designer stores in this area Bring a water bottle with you because there are several TRINKWASSER booths were you can refill them You can take the bus or the tram something I personally did not do because I find bus routes to be very confusing I HIGHLY suggest the HOP ON HOP OFF bus Take a 24 hour ticket for all the lines 25 euros per adult and it will BE WORTH IT The easiest one to find is in the Museum Quarter The yellow line takes you to Schonbrunn Palace Belvedere where DUR KUSS or THE KISS is located This is difficult to go to by yourself so take the HOP ON HOP OFF Book a tour with ROYAL TOURS 119 euros per adult TOTALLY WORTH IT It s a small bus it can fit about 8 people with one man as the driver and guide IT IS GREAT I suggest Prague over Budapest We did not take the Salzburg a beautiful place so take the tour if you were not ale to stay the night because we just came from there 
448701,Hotel Domizil, room could be bigger but this is natural given that hotel is located historical building in old vienna , a great hotel wonderful location in the heart of Vienna very friendly staff nice breakfast clean and tidy 
448702,Hotel Domizil, I was automatically looking for the WiFi code written in the room it would have been easier for me to have it written , I definitely liked the furniture really stylish and bequem 
448703,Hotel Domizil, Being in the middle of Vienna parking is not easy and can be expensive For that it can easily be reached by public transports U Bahn metro railway , Domizil lies right behind the Stephansdom It is a friendly homely place which delivers excellent value for money and is great both for business as for leisure purposes Also suitable for families with children 
448704,Hotel Domizil, THE ONLY THING I WOULD RECOMMEND IS A HANDLE TO HOLD ONTO WHEN YOU ARE ENTERING THE SHOWER IT ALSO COMES HANDY WHEN YOU USE THE SOAP AND THE BOTTOM OF THE SHOWER STALL GETS VERY SLEEPERY THERE IS NOTHING TO GRAB TO BE SURE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO FALL , The croissants were extra flaky outstanding the staff especially FRAU DAGMAR NIEL FANTASTIC EXTREMLY FRIENDLY AND HELPFULL BRAVO FRAU DAGMAR NIEL HOTEL ROOM WAS VERY NICE AND COMFORTABLE 
448705,Hotel Domizil,No Negative, perfect location of hotel you can see all city by foot very polite helpfull and nice staff double room on the 4 th floore with big bathroom breakfast with varius food on the table 
448706,Hotel Domizil, Though it s clean in general but there used to be dust on the side tables that wasn t cleaned And because I have allergy it annoyed me a bit I told the reception about it but they forgot to inform the housekeeping Also in one night I smelled smoking and informed the reception What I didn t like though the response of the receptionist that if it s from one of the guests she can t do anything about it despite that s there s a policy that prohibits smoking inside the property I think what should be done in such cases is to fine the person who broke the rule The smell turned out to be from outside the hotel , My stay at Domizil was so comfortable Arrived in the morning and my room was ready I loved when the receptionist expressed how they considered my request regarding the room The minute I walked into the room I felt relaxed It was cozy has authentic decor and spacious I loved the amenities they provide in the room You have everything you need The kettle to make tea coffee was great addition too Breakfast was very good and always refilled Eggs were always cold though However the restaurant staff were so kind and made hot fresh ones every time I requested that The service at this place is great Everyone is so kind and helpful Even in the night when I had some concerns in my room the receptionist responded fast to make sure it s going well for me Last but not least this hotel has excellent location in the center and it was safe around I am not sure if other alternatives were easy to use but I had to use the taxi for arrival and departure and it cost me 40 for each ride All in all I loved my stay at Domizil 
448707,Hotel Domizil, Nothing not to like No evening restaurant but you are only yards away from Vienna s finest and the hotel breakfasts very good , Really friendly and helpful staff Great breakfast Superb location in the centre of Vienna Large bedroom with lounge area fridge safe Surprisingly quiet area only 150 mtrs from Stephanplatz 
448708,Hotel Domizil, Nothing, Friendly Efficient and welcoming Austrian atmosphere Plenty choice for hot cold breakfast Location was 2 mins from Cathedral Great choice for my milestone birthday Will be staying again and have recommended to friends 
448709,Hotel Domizil, Interior hallway and room ambiance really basic compared to nice antique lobby Even tough non smoking room was obviously smoked in one could smell smoke coming from other rooms as well ,No Positive
448710,Hotel Domizil, Room common parts decor rather dated , On a very quiet street but just behind St Stephens in the centre of the old town so ideal location Comfortable bed Generous breakfast Wifi worked fine Only 12 mins walk to the Wien Mitte stop for the fast train to the airport 
448711,Hotel Domizil, Nothing , Staff extremely helpful and friendly Nothing was too much trouble Everything spotless and towels etc changed everyday Excellent breakfast food choices We bad a marvellous and very enjoyable stay Thoroughly recommended 
448712,Hotel Domizil, No proper bar to unwind with a drink after a long days sightseeing Hotel a little bit more dated than I expected but would I stay here again yes , Location is brilliant Staff nice and friendly 
448713,Hotel Domizil, We wished we had booked for longer , The location 3 minutes away from Stephanplatz the Dom the U bahn and the shops was incredible The staff were very helpful and friendly The hotel was excellent value as the facilities were also excellent and modern with such a central location 
448714,Hotel Domizil, Everything was great thank you, Great location fantastic value really helpful staff very good breakfast included in the price Not worth staying anywhere else 
448715,Hotel Domizil,No Negative, Such a lovely place to stay The room was large and comfortable as was the bed The staff were very friendly and polite As for the Breakfast it was very nice and a lovely way to start the day Perfectly situated for visiting downtown Vienna Heading back to Vienna in May and plan on staying again 
448716,Hotel Domizil, Nothing about the experience to dislike , The Hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful All aspects of the experience were above what I expected for the budget cost Location I am not sure you could get better 30 meters from St Stephan s Plaza with all tourist attractions within easy walking distance or via the simple clean and efficient tram and Underground train network 
448717,Hotel Domizil,No Negative, everything was nice a perfect place in the very center of Vienna and at the same time very quiet and cosy a really nice breakfast spacious room comfortable bed friendly staff
448718,Hotel Domizil, very bad decoration of corridors elevator and reception was terrified going to the room but then positively surprised problem with parking spaces, situated in heart of Viena and great rooms
448719,Hotel Domizil, Coffee served in individual metal containers which do not retain the heat Unless you consume immediately it tends to cool too fast for my tastes , I appreciated the variety of breakfast items available The front desk staff were kind courteous and professional I felt more like I was being welcomed into someone s home than into a hotel Would definitely stay here again 
448720,Hotel Domizil,No Negative, We stayed in apartment rooms which is quite big Perfect breakfast Very comfortable bed Very close to nice local restaurants 3 blocks behind Try P rstner and Wiebels rest In the heart of center Close to performance centers concert halls 
448721,Hotel Domizil, Nothing, Perfect hotel for so many reasons great location and breakfast clean and the best part was the kind staff Definitely I will recommend to travelers that will be visiting Vienna 
448722,Hotel Domizil,No Negative, We had a lovely stay at the hotel Domizil The staff was amazing really good breakfast bed was comfortable and the room was clean We will definitely choose this hotel again 
448723,Hotel Domizil, We stayed on the second floor The breakfast preparation smell were a little bit disturbing in the morning Maybe they need stronger vantilation , The location was excellent Reached Stephanplatz in minutes Almost everything in the old town was in walking distance The breakfast was very tasty The staff was extremely helpful The value for money was perfect We loved our stay 
448724,Hotel Domizil, We left a day early and I informed the hotel that we wanted to cancel the last day but we still got charged I think a partial fee should be taken and not all but it s not a deal breaker We got one night for 99 euros and that s a steal in that location of town Also parking was a problem but next time we ll find a better solution for the car since you don t need it , The location as every year is the main reason we choose this hotel The breakfast and coffee are great Amazing restaurants near by the Christmas market next door and just the overall ambiance during Xmas season is something DEFINITELY not to be missed 
448725,Hotel Domizil, It was a little bit cold most likely because of the panoramic window instead of the front wall so we had to close the curtains tight Ventilation system in the bathroom was very dusty and needs to be cleaned out Tv remote control was also rather dirty , The staff is extremely helpful and nice The breakfast is rather diverse and good The room and bathroom are spacious Nice view from the window on the calm street White sheets and extra blankets Amazing location Will definitely stay here again Value for money could not be better 
448726,Hotel Domizil, Our room was at front so some traffic noise, Super comfy beds and excellent breakfast Location of hotel is excellent and easy reach from subway stations 
448727,Hotel Domizil, One of towels was unclean bad lights in room and bath very thin walls Expensive parking , Very central location room on quiet street good breakfast friendly staff
448728,Hotel Domizil, Not really new interior but depends on your expectations Apart from that everything is very very good , Excellent location really in the very center easy to get from airport express station as well Very good breakfast Friendly helpful staff 
448729,Hotel Domizil, Nothing, The situation all major sites are with in walking distance Staff vers Nice ans helpful Large clean rooms Great beds Quiet place Great breakfast
448730,Hotel Domizil, Slightly larger single beds , Felt safe and welcoming We felt cared for No need to take toiletries apart from personal items Anything forgotten would have been provided Very good buffet breakfast served from 7 10 am Perfect location In the heart of the city centre but quiet 
448731,Hotel Domizil, The woman at the reception did not go out of her way to help I asked her questions about the airport She just said she doesn t know She could have called I asked her sthg else as well n replied that she doesn t know She could make extra efforts She wasn t very helpful But the man at the reception was really nice n helpful Sorry i forgot the names Tx,No Positive
448732,Hotel Domizil, Bed a little hard and shower isolator didn t work so bath difficult to run, Location superb Room spacious and generally well appointed breakfast excellent
448733,Hotel Domizil, I didn t see before 4 star hotel like Domizil hotel I don t know who gave 4 star to this hotel Lift and everything in this hotel is too old Was I seen very old hotels but with updated facilities In the room adding very simple kettle with one tea bag In the bathroom only one very small towel for shower and one small towel for hand wash Not any self sanitary The WiFi didn t work on my two days stay The neighbor hotel WiFi reach to my room better work and higher speed At all this hotel is 2 star hotel and not 4 star hotel , Location and friendly staffs
448734,Hotel Domizil, Water glasses could have been bigger at breakfast Other than that breakfast was great , Clara our concierge and check in staff was super helpful and knowledgeable Also loved our room 304 
448735,Hotel Domizil,No Negative, Great central location very friendly staff and excellent German style buffet breakfast The hotel was very accommodating of some special requests that we had 
448736,Hotel Domizil,No Negative, Wonderful breakfast The staff were extremely friendly and helped in any way they could The room was spacious and clean and very comfortable despite being on the ground floor The location is just two blocks from the cathedral but is quiet and more like a residential neighborhood Great wifi access The building itself is beautiful 
448737,Hotel Domizil, This is not 4 star hotel 2 3 is more accurate There s no bar or lounge facilities or any other facilities I would expect for 4 stars Double bed was 2 singles put together Needs redecorating as very tired The teas and coffees available in the room was poor we had to buy our own , Great location friendly staff and room was clean
448738,Hotel Domizil, Nothing, Location was great in the middle of the downtown just minutes walk to metro station The room was wide we have a first floor room Breakfast was fine Overall it is a very nice hotel 
448739,Hotel Domizil, The hotel was offered as a luxury deal However the hotel is past its glory days Everything looked a bit old and scruffy This did not look like a luxury deal to us We specifically asked for a quiet room but each morning we could hear the cleaners who seemed to park their trolley with tools just outside our room , The location was very good Staff was friendly The beds were excellent and shower was good 
448740,Hotel Domizil,No Negative, The location is right in the center part of the tourist area Easy walking area brings you to most of the spots you may want to visit Near the metro U trains Very near the canal and the Danube River Many good restaurants within an easy walk of one to 10 minutes Very close to St Stephens Cathedral Good attentive staff Very nice breakfast buffet 
448741,Hotel Domizil, I didn t like the bed It was hard and unconfortable but I got used to it, Location is great right in the city center 2min away from st stephan cathedral and from the metro station Breakfast was very nice too and tasty
448742,Hotel Domizil, Very basic room decor Small shower Thin walls let the noise in , Centrally located behind the St Stephen s cathedral Friendly staff Nice breakfast included Clean but relatively basic bathrooms 
448743,Hotel Domizil, nothing, Everything was perfect The room was really clean and cozy Everyone in the hotel was kind and helpful Stronly recommend this hotel If i visit Vienna again i will stay here again

448745,Hotel Domizil, Nothing Everything suited our needs perfectly, The location of hotel was amazing walking distance to all the tourist sites Great value for money very happy with my stay 
448746,Hotel Domizil, Nothing comes to mind, Excellent location charming hotel that was in keeping with the ambiance of old Vienna but with the modern facilities Staff were helpful friendly and professional I came back to the UK and suggested to my wife we return for our next anniversary
448747,Hotel Domizil,No Negative, The staff are very helpful and friendly we enjoyed our stay we have a comfortable room and the food were good Thank you so much Hoping to stay again when we visit Vienna 
448748,Hotel Domizil,No Negative, The location could hardly be better only a minute walk from St Stephens cathedral The room and hotel in genera is a bit worn and basic but quite comfortable and the staff were nice and helpful Breakfast was really good If you want a central hotel then this is a pretty reasonable choice 
448749,Hotel Domizil, same as all the elevators in old building small slow, perfect location just nearby the church Stephansdom almost all famous places of interesting can be reached on foot it s easy to take metro as well kind and helpful staffs good breakfast as an european 4 stars hotel in center of city there s no more can be claimed 
448750,Hotel Domizil,No Negative, Great Breakfast Included Staff from the reception to the kitchen are amazing and will help out with any request Rooms are simple and have everything you need 
448751,Hotel Domizil,No Negative, Very helpful reception staff who all spoke excellent English Good variety of breakfast options which really set us up for the day Couldn t wish for a more central location 
448752,Hotel Domizil, for some reason the stairwell and hallway outside of our room on 2nd floor smelled of cigarette smoke but the room was fine but incredibly minor , Location is amazing less then 5 minutes walk from main cathedral about 10 to the palace you can t get more central Metro stop is also outside cathedral Breakfast was excellent down to presentation of eggs as scrambled or cooked for 6 vs 12 min 
448753,Hotel Domizil, There were strange and noisy sounds in the early morning from the streat I suppose they were coming from the garbage men which for sure was not appropriate at all , It is situated on a perfect place It is right behind the Stephan s Cathedral and close to the old city The breakfast was fabulous It was my second visit to this hotel and it would definitely happen again 
448754,Hotel Domizil, Some of the hot food items were not replenished during breakfast but we were late each morning , The hotel is excellent I requested blankets instead of a douvet and I got the blankets I also payed my bill on checkout and not on check in as is becoming an annoying norm Good selection for breakfast 
448755,Hotel Domizil, Nothing very happy with stay Staff friendly quick to help Closeness to square and shopping restaurants very close easy quick walk , Great breakfast spread staff very helpful and friendly 
448756,Hotel Domizil, Breakfast is good could have been better Breakfast room rather small Rooms on second floor have no easy access to staircase This could be hazardous in case of fire , Location excellent Room simple but spacious Bed comfortable 
448757,Hotel Domizil, The room is a little bit too small and a little table is not convenient for work , Excellent location Good breakfast Nice interior decoration with Schille s reproductions Very pleasant atmosphere 
448758,Hotel Domizil, Noise from the street might be quite strong since the windows are rather old and don t isolate that much , The rooms are very comfortable the choice at the breakfast is good the staff is very nice and helpful I would recommend this hotel 
448759,Hotel Domizil, There is no safe in the rooms The key is normal not magnetic and in 2016 must be delivered to the reception while going out of the hotel , The Old design of the building and its great location
448760,Hotel Domizil, We do not get the room from the photos on booking com it was a room which looked like a hostel room very clean but still not what we saw at the photos when booking the room, We loved the location and the staff was really nice
448761,Hotel Domizil, Typical old building meaning that windows are very thin and noise can be heard from the street, Room are spacious and the bathroom big and really modern Location right in the heart of Vienna with plenty of restaurants around WiFi is excellent Breakfast is good
448762,Hotel Domizil, Only a small point same CD including Amazing Grace every morning during breakfast Never my favourite track , Central location possible to walk to all main tourist spots Helpful staff quiet room 
448763,Hotel Domizil, The parking situation sucks but it s not the hotel s fault just wish there was a more economical option for parking the car in a garage near by for the day , Loved the location staff and breakfast The room and bed was super comfortable With two small kids room 303 was perfect for space and facilities Really an awesome location and place to stay for a weekend city trip 
448764,Hotel Domizil, Be careful with rooms to rear Street is cobbled and bins dragged up and down from early morning 5 30am This is s budget hotel and not a business hotel In fact sign at entrance says Pension Domizil , Great location so close to Cathedral square and within walking distance of all the Vienna sights Excellent breakfast wifi and very clean 
448765,Hotel Domizil,No Negative, We had an apartment at the top of the hotel with a vast amount of space Central position was excellent for sightseeing and local to good restaurants 
448766,Hotel Domizil, not really , We had to come back to stay here since we could not travel to Budapest The staff was friendly and made our stay comfortable The breakfast spread was very good The location is fantastic In the city centre and close to most tourist locations 
448767,Hotel Domizil,No Negative, This hotel is located on a quiet street two blocks from the center of the city It is impeccably clean with a very good breakfast and an endlessly helpful staff Great value for money 
448768,Hotel Domizil, The exterior and the entrance are quite drab and give bad first impression Luckily the breakfast room and the room corridors look recently renovated No air conditioning in the Apartment we were given only a fan , Very central position close to Stephan s Dom We were give a room in a dependance Old high middle class building nice but creaky parquet however spatious and cosy A taste of old Vienna Bathroom quite news 
448769,Hotel Domizil, The hotel is on street and the soundproof is relatively poor maybe because this is an old hotle I can hear the person living next to me coughing and plugging his phone cable But anyway it is a value deal and the street is relatively quiet in the night Good choice if you don t have sensitive nerves against noisies , Great location in the center of city center St Stephen Church is just in the corner and it is 5 minutes by metro to the museums Hoffberg and the Opera House Staff are nice and friendly 
448770,Hotel Domizil, Shower needs upgrading Bathtub slippery shower screen too small and bathroom floor became covered with water and was slippery also , Breakfast was good room was spacious and comfortable and staff were pleasant and helpful 
448771,Hotel Domizil, l have no complaints , Great location staff were very helpful l arrived at 8am and they were able to check me in at that stage which was great after a long haul flight There was great variety for breakfast 
448772,Hotel Domizil, No heating in the room very poor breakfast unhelpfull staff poor wifi hotel needs renovation small tv, comfortable bad water boiler in the room very central location
448773,Hotel Domizil,No Negative, We were in this hotel almost in the end of August and people in the reception were really friendly and nice Breakfast was good our room was comfortable 
448774,Hotel Domizil, Slight problem due to lack of air conditioning I am assuming this would not usually be a too much of a concern but when we were there it was extremely hot at 38c , Very clean room and also light and bright Good location of the hotel 
448775,Hotel Domizil, The only problem was that the wifi signal would sometimes disappear But we did not have this problem during our previous stay so it might depend on the room s location , It was nice coming back to Hotel Domizil Everything was very nice and the staff was very friendly as well The location is ideal just a couple of steps away from Stephansplatz and the subway from where you can get to many places in town and to the Central Railway Station The room was very spacious and clean and the beds were comfortable The bathroom was very clean too Everything at the breakfast was fresh and the staff was very helpful I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Vienna because I think it s the best hotel in the city centre 
448776,Hotel Domizil, Very disappointed with standards of accommodation at the hotel although a friendly staff This is a very tired run down hotel With a beautiful misleading fa ade exterior and a disappointing decaying interior made of cheap old fashioned dated and poor quality furniture and fixtures The rooms look like they have not been decorated in years Shabby furniture impersonal decorations without the slightest taste No class at all Somehow this hotel still has a 4 rating which was probably justified some 50 years ago Now in my opinion a 2 rate would be even too high Prices of course are those of a 4 class which make this hotel a very bad value for your money Then we stayed here at the beginning of August The daily outside temperature was about 35 37 C degrees and the best we could have in the room during the night was around 25 We discovered that rooms had no air conditioning so we had to sleep with the windows wide open Air conditioning is an exclusive of the lobby floor With only a poor fan in the room we are gasping The is a safe in the room which is good The only problem is that it doesn t work with a code like 99 of nowadays hotel safes No it needs a key Ehm THE key Because yes there is only ONE key for each room and guests have to contact the reception each time the want to open the safe Old good keys are really loved here Like safes rooms still open with a key attached to an extremely heavy key holder which you necessarily have to deposit at the reception when going out Here we are still in another era far before the time when magnetic cards will make their appearance Breakfast is also quite poor The offer is definitely basic in both quantity and selection and no healthy products are proposed Moreover guests have to bear the same tiring and depressing CD of old pop song s instrumental versions In order to escape from it people eat as quickly as possible , The central location is the only plus but that is not enough to make me stay again
