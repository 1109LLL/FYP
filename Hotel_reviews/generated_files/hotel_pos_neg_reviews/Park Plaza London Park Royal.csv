226715,Park Plaza London Park Royal, The location is a bit far from the centre of London , The room was very comfortable Even though it s close to a highway there was no noise in the room we had 
226716,Park Plaza London Park Royal, There are not enough car parking spaces to the number of rooms which will cause problems to guests that arrive later in the evening No matter how careful you are you will flood water in to the bathroom via the sliding shower door Do not undertand why both full English and Continental breakfasts are the same price , Location and access to Central London Room and space
226717,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Could not get any sleep the whole night too much noise It was devastating i would like some sort of compensation from this hotel Spoke to the reception team no one contacted me , The location 
226718,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Only minor issue regarding the housekeeping They need to check their services Sometimes they forget to do everything they should do during room services Delay in cleaning the room Forgot to replace towels It happened only one time but the hotel manager in duty reacted quickly and apologized, Staff are so polite and professional especially people wirking in the reception
226719,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Location inconvenient very far from the city of london The station next to the hotel Royal Park is NOT connected with the Central Line Instead you need to go to Hunger Lane Station which is a good 15 minutes walking from the hotel Don t believe that you can go to the City of London in 35 minutes You need 15 minutes walking to Hunger Lane and then another 40 minutes on the Central Line ,No Positive
226720,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Nothing to do with the staff but felt uncomfortable with a drunk and aggressive customer and not confident the staff could have dealt with it if the behaviour got worse not that they should have to of course , Very contemporary style with all the mod cons including remote control lights Delightful stay and would book again if in area 
226721,Park Plaza London Park Royal, No outlet for dryers in bathroom, Could order eggs any way you like Great location for access to London Still easy to drive out and get to rest of Britain 
226722,Park Plaza London Park Royal, The staff at the reception seemed not very familiar with their jobs There was often long queue at the reception Although the team indeed delivered their service with friendly attitude they could not handle the regular check in check out proceeding in an efficient and organised way Overall I felt that the hotel was understaffed and did not provide sufficient training to the employees therefore the service quality was seriously damaged , The staff at the dining area were generally friendly 
226723,Park Plaza London Park Royal, No outer door on the bathroom and the shared sliding door between the shower and the loo Easy chair in bedroom was uncomfortably hard on the bottom , Super King Size bed was great and comfortable TV was good size Liked the idea of having an ironing board and iron for personal use 
226724,Park Plaza London Park Royal, No door to separate the bathroom from the rest of the room Breakfast was ok but not great , Decent size room Convenient location very close to Park Royal tube stop 
226725,Park Plaza London Park Royal, The shower leaked onto the floor of the bathroom unfortunately slight design flaw but nothing serious Breakfast was a bit cold but probably because we were late , Great breakfast selection
226726,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Breakfast buffet was badly managed Constantly running out of food and no one keeping and eye on situation , Good location clean throughout and polite and friendly staff
226727,Park Plaza London Park Royal, The process for using the the TV totally sucks They need a better process , The access to public transportation was great We took the underground everywhere we had to go 
226728,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Food was good but a bit exspensive, The Hotel Was clean and the beds comfy it is well situated for buses and railway station and plenty of food outlets a short walk away The staff were very pleasant and nothing was to much trouble for them
226729,Park Plaza London Park Royal, The hotel is right next to a busy dualcarage way so can be noisy , Excellent hotel staff friendly and helful also very close to the underground so easy to get around 
226730,Park Plaza London Park Royal, There Wasn t any thing at the hotel that I did not like , Like the fact that was very friendly and clean was bit of confusion with the breakfast which should have been part of the price pack was not at the desk it was not but the website on my booking state it was part of the package But over all it was lovely and clean I will be going back there again
226731,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Nothing to say here , Very nice chatty staff at reception Very comfortable large bed Lovely bathroom with Elemis products Great air con one of the hottest days in London 
226732,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Very little to complain about But on certain peak dates some nights are over charged for what you get in return , Simple pleasant comfortable Outstandingly helpful and decent staff 
226733,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Car park too packed I struggled to leave the hotel car park as cars were not parked sensibly resulting in ticket expiring then holding up the traffic to get out of the car park while I waited for help , Full blown Sky TV 
226734,Park Plaza London Park Royal, I didn t like that king superior bed was two single beds put together The only thing I didn t like about my experience , The room was great and the staff were very polite and helpful 
226735,Park Plaza London Park Royal, I would like a door to the bathroom proper , Nice modern hotel well situated opposite a tube station Reception staff were very polite and efficient Room was comfortable bed a bit firm for me but you can t please everyone and the touch pad for the room controls was good very intuitive Breakfast was tasty and plentiful and they allowed us to leave our car in their carpark for a few hours after we checked out so that we could do some sight seeing 
226736,Park Plaza London Park Royal, only stayed as I could not cancel the booking As booking com changed the terms wont be coming back its not worth an advance payment nice but not a 5 star to be charging in advance I know more up market hotels EG Syon park who do not advance charge will be going there next time The receptionist promised me an upgrade for my inconvenience but it was just the floor above same rate room no perks here they just want your money ,No Positive
226737,Park Plaza London Park Royal, When hotel personal entered room whilst sleeping , The tv was great mini bar was fantastic shower clean and powerful bed comfy and excellent ice dispenser 
226738,Park Plaza London Park Royal, The only thing I didn t like was when the breakfast came in the morning The toast was cold , I loved everything about this hotel excellent customer service excellent room service The room and hotel was absolutely amazing There were two smoking areas one with tables and chairs also which was awesome Also I liked the fact you can pay as you go I paid for my room service breakfast by card with the card reader they provided 
226739,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Couldn t really find fault with it , Ideal location if going to Wembley stadium Hotel is very new and room size is perfect for short stay Beds are super comfortable and room had blackout curtains 
226740,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Staff were not particularly competant spoke poor English Breakfast was not worth the 12 charged Premier Inn offer much better quality , Room was comfortable and clean Convenient location next to the tube station However not worth the 200 mark up due to Adele performing at Wembley 
226741,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Unfortunately although the breakfast looked appetising my husband didn t enjoy his cooked breakfast as majority of the food he chose was cold most probably due to the lid of the heated container being left constantly open , The room was a good size shower very efficient and very quiet peaceful room
226742,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Breakfast was a buffet but was basic Only egg option was scrambled For 299 per night it could have been better Room 407 shower leaked all over the floor in the bathroom , Staff were very friendly and helpful Prices were inflated as we were visiting the Adele show at nearby Wembley 299 not including breakfast which we added on once at the hotel was expensive but I understand it s a supply and demand situation 
226743,Park Plaza London Park Royal, What I did NOT like was the following Bacon not cooked folded from the freezer and cooked in the oven so the bacon is not cooked in the middle The toaster not quick enough people queuing for toast Ate in the restaurant on four occasions the service from the kitchen was terrible Over ten minutes for bread and butter and 30 minutes for a main course This is a new hotel but the kitchen staff need to turn the food around in a quicker period of time The price of wine and brandy is extortionate no house wine of a reasonable price Bar seating is badly designed and failing, Bedroom and Bathroom well appointed Iron and small ironing board in the room saves the hassle of asking reception for one Lighting controls are convenient on the small screen by the bed and at the entrance
226744,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Disappointed with the bar Minimal staff operating On the night that I stayed there was only one personnel serving the bar aswell as serving drinks for the adjacent bar I waited over 20mins to get served without any acknowledgement Frankly Not good enough , Great cleanliness Rooms immaculate Certainly exceeded my expectations 
226745,Park Plaza London Park Royal, They need more staff serving at meal times Breakfast a big let down Everything had run out when we got there and very slow at topping up if at all Not enough tables for the size of hotel Had to queue 25 mins just to get to the coffee machine Staff that was there were trying their best just not enough of them , Hotel very new and very smart modern Room very clean and comfortable especially the bed had a good nights sleep Unique shower rom 
226746,Park Plaza London Park Royal, The hotel seems ill equipped to cope when a big event is on at Wembley Although the staff were trying their best some fundamental design flaws ment that things did not go smoothly The check in desk is too small and badly situated so when you were queuing you were blocking the lifts There was not enough seating in the dining room for breakfast and we had to wait ages for a table and there is only one coffee machine to serve the entire dining room Lunch in the restaurant was ok but service very slow even though not many other people were in there And there was a complete disaster when it came to ordering a cab to go to the concert which basically ended up with us being 40 mins late I think this could be a good hotel with better thought and management but definitely not 4 star service at the moment , Rooms were clean and bed was comfy breakfast when we finally got it was fresh and quite nice 
226747,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Check in was appalling room not ready after 2 hrs then one staff joked about the fact they had given our room away by accident , Bedroom really comfy 
226748,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Only one coffee machine which was slow so caused a queue across the entrance to the dining area , A great selection of both English and continental breakfast 
226749,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Housekeeping for the second time costing me a small fortune by cleaning my room despite Do Not Disturb sign on the door Additionally they don t understand the mistake they have made because they do not speak English so when trying to rectify it end up continuing to do damage until a member of staff who can communicate between both parties explains Medication now unusable some damage to trainers but overall just a monumental hassle both dealing with the mistakes and then having to rectify them in my own time i e prescription medication and other medications being lost or rendered unusuitable for use , Clean room excellent desk staff 
226750,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Little expencive the phone in our room did not work when we were trying to get room service , New hotel excellent location for visiting this area of London we were going to a concert at Wembley Easy to get there with Park Royal Underground station on the other side of the road 
226751,Park Plaza London Park Royal, 1 Parking The parking is busy and there was construction site on the hotel this should be temporary but getting and out is not easy and Parking is not included in the price 10 per 24 hours if you do not want to park in the hotel then you have to walk across a dual carriage way good luck with that 2 There is only shower in the apartments There is bath tub Despite the fact that I have been promised a bath tub and this was confirmed via booking com when I got to the room there was no bath tub and I have been by the reception and the manager that there are no bath tubs in none of the hotel rooms So if you want need a bath tub this is not your hotel In the room options on booking com it says Bath tub or Shower but be aware that there are no bath tubs 3 The design is nice and fancy inside the hotel but then what s the point when you sit in the loo and there is a 5 cm gap between the loo and wall The door stopped 5cm before completely closing Guess what there was no main door separating the toilet from bathroom Use your imagination what could this be like if there are two of you in the room Also if you shut the toilet door the bathroom will have no door thanks to its strange design Its a sliding door between the bathroom and the loo with no main door separating the toilet from living room And as you may guess the rooms are not that big at all I had a Superior king room 2 or one step from toilet and you were in the living room 4 There was limited shampoo and soap in the bathroom If you need more then you had to call and kind and hard working I am assuming overloaded staff with their duties will bring you the extras in no time a waiting time of 5 to 15 minutes 5 Location wise it is not much great You have to drive about 40 55 minutes including traffic in Busy London to get to hotel from London city centre , Friendly and helpful staff The hotel is kind of cheap for its location I mean London and then it has the normal facilities that you get in every 4 star hotel Read more on the what I did not like in the next part 
226752,Park Plaza London Park Royal,No Negative, The staff where friendly and very helpful the room was spotless bed very comfortable so had a good nights sleep Would be happy to recommend the hotel 
226753,Park Plaza London Park Royal, A little business like and very modern sharp to feel cosy especially for a couple romantic getaway No bath in bathroom Not enough tea coffee milk provided Not happy with breakfast would prefer waitress service a bit like a rugby scrum when we went down on Sunday morning queues no tables Found it difficult to find things toast took ages and the breakfast items did look taste like something from a cheap cafe , The new clean feeling of the hotel Friendly helpful reception staff 
226754,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Teething problems in the kitchen restaurant staff were very good but unfortunately the Chef was off , Recently opened Hotel Great location for our trip to Wembley Staff were very friendly and very helpful Very clean hotel very modern beds amazing and room facilities spot on 
226755,Park Plaza London Park Royal, I tried to call the reception to get me tooth brushes and tooth paste but the receptions kept cut me off so We couldn t even brush our teeth The products inside the bathroom were missing as well as sleepers and that wasn t good enough service for the price we payed , I like the location of property 
226756,Park Plaza London Park Royal, N outside seating when ordering an omelette that s what you got no garnish nothing asked for milk to be sent up for tea and coffeevamdbthey charged 2 59 forvit, Aircon
226757,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Our bathroom door was stuck but the staff managed it pretty fast , We had a very pleasant stay The bed was really big and the room over all was to our liking The hotel is located in the west part of the city and the piccadilly line of the tube was just on the other side of the road Park Royal Station 35 40 mins to piccadilly circus Moreover there is another Tube station about ten minutes away the central line hangers lane the breakfast was also great We would recommend the hotel to everyone who likes to be a little outside of the fuzz in the city 
226758,Park Plaza London Park Royal, TV in room was awful Almost impossible to use the smart features and the staff advised it s not compatible with Netflix , Nice clean and very modern hotel spacious rooms plenty of parking and a decent breakfast 
226759,Park Plaza London Park Royal, TV didn t work Dan sorted it but it s a regular issue Shower leaks water everywhere lame last week in a different room Phone in room didn t work Evening meal good but dessert left waiting ages wasn t very warm and ice cream very melted was refunded Bike in gym ok but TV radio nothing would work to listen to used my phone Breakfast chaotic After 2 trips through the toaster still warm bread Coffee machine causes a bottleneck , Staff very very good
226760,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Car park has about 20 spaces for hundreds of rooms people had parked stupidly and made it difficult to even manoeuvre around it This is my only negative for this hotel , The interior of the entire hotel was beautiful and stylishly modern Staff were extremely friendly Rooms were spotless and bed very comfortable Would recommend and stay here again 
226761,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Shower leaked out of the cubicle onto the rest of the bathroom floor had to mop it all up with another towel the mood light turns other lights on aswel as the blue mirror light if there was a option to turn just the blue mirror light on that would be so much better The sky channels didn t work but they did offer to change our room but because we were only staying for the weekend we didn t change Apart from that it was a wonderful stay, Design of the room was beautiful bed was comfy hotel was absolutely beautiful staff at reception were so helpful when my husband wanted some food late at night Ice machine on the landing outside our room it s a really good feature Next time I m in London I will definitely stay here again
226762,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Charge for local calls little farther from city center no addition restaurants around besides what s at hotel , Room accommodations modern and spacious Right off the Piccadilly line Guest services staff and security very friendly and helpful 
226763,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Nothing, Absolutely fantastic service very friendly and accommodating My partner had a surprise for me and the staff facilitated and helped so much We both really appreciated that The room was gorgeous and clean absolute pleasure to stay in wish we booked another night 
226764,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Nothing very good stay, Very modern and clean hotel situated directly off the main road but from the room you cannot hear any traffic noise Parking was easy and we were checked in and had the room card within five minutes of arriving From the exit of the hotel it was a 1 minute walk under the underpass and to Park Royal tube station very convenient There is also a retail park just around the corner with restaurants and a cinema The room was very clean and comfortable with all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay The control panel for all the lights and air conditioning on the bedside table was very handy Very helpful staff and the breakfast buffet includes everything you could want Very happy
226765,Park Plaza London Park Royal, It was a Saturday night and there were some people nearby taking advantage of that I was woken at 6am by some banging for someone to open a door in the corridor I have not factored that into the ratings as that is going to happen from time to time on a Fri Sat in a hotel , Bedroom was fantastic really loved the decor and the little touches of detail 
226766,Park Plaza London Park Royal, There is no change in the breakfast menu on any day during my stay of 4 nights this needs to be looked at by the management , Location staff and service are very very good 
226767,Park Plaza London Park Royal,No Negative, The property is conveniently located for my work and my business just outside of London The staff are exceptional and really friendly and accommodating to your individual needs The hotel rooms are really nice and clean 
226768,Park Plaza London Park Royal, When you turn on the smart tv it shows you a menu of features including watching tv but sometimes it was difficult to choose watch tv from the menu as it is not automatically, The staff were so friendly with us we got free wifi and 24h room service with food is great Its a new hotel and very affordable for london with so many amenities Breakfast was included in our package 
226769,Park Plaza London Park Royal, N A, The hotel is still brand new and modern The staff is so friendly and helpful It is right in front of the underground station of Park Royal which takes u directly to Central London in less than 25 min As for the breakfast there is quite a nice variety of food ranging from scrambled eggs to cheese and juices and fruits etc It is worth every penny I spent 
226770,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Nothing to report , We had breakfast in the restaurant which was excellent the staff were extremely helpful and friendly Room was spacious very comfortable and covered all our needs 
226771,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Would have much preferred to be served tea and coffee at breakfast as the coffee machine wasn t particularly nice Also a minor point a little more attention to detail when clearing and setting tables for breakfast , This was a lovely modern hotel with excellent facilities and great location for the tube station Huge credit for having full sky TV package Elemis bath products amazing quality breakfast and friendly staff members especially the reception team 
226772,Park Plaza London Park Royal, The breakfast was quite expensive for the stuff they were offering and the trays were empty when we got to have breakfast The receptionist was really confused to find our name even when we showed our booking We stayed in a room for disabled people and was fantastic but I d say the toilet get wet too much so we wonder if a disabled person would be ok as they could easily slide into it , The staff the room the design the bed 
226773,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Breakfast wasn t worth the money I didn t think No effort made to replenish what had ran out and livery little to choose from , Beautiful rooms and very well equipped Stones throw away from Park Royal tube station 
226774,Park Plaza London Park Royal,No Negative, Everything was perfect Hotel is newly built and modern Staffs were very friendly and helpful very comfy king size bed Smart TV is a big bonus Underground was just 2 3 minutes walk away from the hotel rear entrance 
226775,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Nothing not to like , We loved staying at this brand new hotel It was absolutely beautiful from the entrance to our room We felt very welcomed by Tara who greeted us on arrival she also asked if we were staying for an occasion and it was for my partner s birthday later on that day when we came back to our Hotel room Tara had wrote such a lovely card along with a gorgeous piece of birthday cake It made our stay extra special We would personally like to thank her for all her effort and acknowledgement We also went down for dinner at the restaurant which again was absolutely amazing The restaurant was beautifully laid out and we cannot explain how good the food was as well as the customer service 
226776,Park Plaza London Park Royal, The Hotel was fabulous however the check in procedures need to be improved massively It took 30 mins to check in The trainee staff member was not supported by the one remaining trained staff member who despite the trainee struggling left her to continue faffing with our check in Despite having paid in advance for the room they tried to take a 100 deposit for any potential room service for the 2 separate rooms booked This process was also not completed correctly with a charge of 157 00 being put onto my account I will check that this has been removed but didnt give me any confidence in the procedures The trainee was polite and helpful but she just needed careful mentoring through the process The whole hotel was beautiful but it all seemed under staffed and the staff require more customer care and procedure training , The hotel is very luxurious and comfortable with Excellent facilities 
226777,Park Plaza London Park Royal,No Negative, Front Desk team cheerful and helpful Anastasia and Eurica were super good in the restaurant Eurica is a star watched her handle the entire busy restaurant with ease and efficiency And the food was very good
226778,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Screen in shower should be bigger or extendable to stop flooding the bathroom floor Only enough supply for 2 cups of tea Where as has to ask for more for a cuppa in the morning , Very modren and clean All mod cons Touch pad for all controlls Brilliant 
226779,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Parking was somewhat limited and you were unable to book a space which is slightly inconvenient however Staff were very friendly and did everything they could to find you a parking space Would be great if the hotel would let you book parking even if it was at a premium rate to provide piece of mind when travelling particularly late We arrived at midnight and would like to have known that we definitely had a car spot rather then just having to wait and see , The Hotel is very new modern and comfortable Reception was open 24 hours which makes it ideal if travelling inter city to London in the evening after work Parking was 10 per night which is comparable if not cheaper then other hotels in the area We selected this hotel primarily because of its proximity to the London Underground Park Royal station is a 3 min walk making it very easy to get into central London Room was modern and lighting and temperature could be controlled entirely by an access panel on each bedside table Facilities were very clean and the bed was very comfortable 
226780,Park Plaza London Park Royal, The landscaping needs to be finished for the full effect Using the hotel s other entrance when ready will make a big difference when it s raining , Very good location and a breakfast worth getting up a little bit earlier to savour 
226781,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Ordered breakfast to room which never came They lost our order Breakfast eventually came which was very unsatisfactory It was thrown on a plate Our phone in the room didn t work either which we asked for it to be fixed but never done We asked reception to book a taxi for us but they forgot to Other guests had the same issue with taxis More attention to detail Really friendly service from the lady on the reception desk called Tara Parking should be free for hotel guests , Nice hotel which has recently opened The room was lovely and quiet Cannot comment on the breakfast as we paid for it but with the problems we had never comsumed it 
226782,Park Plaza London Park Royal, I didn t like the fact that the robes were not that comfortable and also the check out time was a bit early for me , The main thing i liked was the size of the room and bathroom The price is very reasonable Also the bed was very comfortable and the rooms were very clean I also liked the fact that the television was a smart tv meaning you can access music through the television via your phone 
226783,Park Plaza London Park Royal, My concern is more off personal preference than a complaint I guess The beds were a little to firm for my liking It wasn t to uncomfortable I just like a more pillowy mattress , I loved the decor and cleanliness off the property The staff was super friendly especially the front desk I enjoyed the mobile room controls for the rooms that were beside You could control lights and temperature from the bedside without fumbling around the room or getting out of bed The location was excellent right next to the underground 
226784,Park Plaza London Park Royal, my previous visit some six weeks ago has not addressed the issues I itemised and raised then so must be work in progress same goes for the contractors still working in the car park , Overall the room and its facilites were good 
226785,Park Plaza London Park Royal, The fact that the staff kept mistakenly entering my room They were very kind with the apologies though This happened twice though, The staff was kind and so were the facilities
226786,Park Plaza London Park Royal, The staff was very sarcastic The staff could improve in his attitude The only problem we had was quantity of sugar or milk but wasn t too much of an issue The shower room toilet was lovely but the only problem was the glass panel for the shower being too short of distance so the water escapes very easily and it is hard to maintain the cleanliness of the bathroom as well as enjoy the shower , We asked the staff could we have a room on the top floor at the same time quiet the only room available was near a lift Even better Noise was never an issue We asked whether the room had a nice view of the skyline and he had told us that there s no view other than the motorways I APOLOGISE BUT THIS MAN WAS A LIAR WHEN WE GOT TO OUR ROOM THE SKYLINE WAS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS Will Definitely be back again one day The room was absolutely gorgeous all in all it was perfect The quality of the hotel was very authentic they had provided shower caps and Q tips cotton buds whatever you may call them and cotton pads They had little treats you could buy in the freezer and across the road we have PIZZA HUT NANDOS THE VUE CINEMA WE HAVE ALL SORTS OF STORES AROUND AND IT IS PERFECT COULDN T ASK FOR MORE And as we are Muslims we needed halal food nandos being halal was just a bonus 
226787,Park Plaza London Park Royal, There is no door for the toilet only one sliding door between the shower the toilet seat , The hotel is very new every thing is modern 
226788,Park Plaza London Park Royal,No Negative, I loved the girl on the reception with black hair She was soooo friendly and she actually remember every detail of what people Told her That means she Obviously loves what she does Really friendly i really enjoyed my stay 
226789,Park Plaza London Park Royal,No Negative, The hotel is right next to the tube station which has lines to central London The hotel overall is extremely modern The staff are extremely friendly and accommodating Strangely although it is next to a busy road it s dead quiet obviously a good thing We went to a show in Hammersmith this hotel was completely convenient for that and really reasonably priced compared to other hotels It is a bit far out for Central London 35 mins tube however close to west London e g Hammersmith Chelsea Fulham area We stayed for one night and would highly recommend it and stay again in the future 
226790,Park Plaza London Park Royal, During dinner the waiting staff were otherwise engaged and it took a long time to attract attention to take our orders and pay the bill I ended up approaching them at the bar to pay before returning to my room , The service was very efficient but not intrusive 
226791,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Air con was faulty in the King Studio was offered to move rooms but we only had a few hours left to stay so we was offered a discounted second stay to make up for it Car park is a bit Cramped, Lovely Bed to sleep in Very Comfortable Great Rooms and Decor
226792,Park Plaza London Park Royal, We ordered food it took an hour and a half to get out the food was absolutely non edible and we we re not happy with the service after spending nearly 900 during our stay The manager came and halved the bill 8people and only one person at the table had there meal We were still charged 27 for drinks even Dow we were 1 hour late for our taxi and we were still being charged as our taxi waited out side and we told the manager this and still got charged even Dow it was there staff that held us back We came back to the hotel after thr first night and ordered 332 in alcohol and when we went to get another vodka we were told no because it was past 12 00 so my aunt had to practically beg for a vodka as she dosent drink anything else I didnt understand why as we were spending money in there hotel Also I payed for my room on arrival and I was told I owed the full amount plus more before I left I was so embarrassed and it was said in front of the whole place The lady handed me a recipt and tryed to show me what i owed and i had already added 50 to my account that covered my bill I was made to feel so small it was totally uncalled for I ve stayed in park plazas before and never had such a bad experience ever Also I stood at the reception standing my cornor as I knew I didnt owe 295 that she tryed to take The bathroom was rediculous and the shower soaked the whole bathroom when you used it and the carpet in our room was soaking wet when we arrived I honestly do not complain And its my first time to write a review but I felt it was appropriate , Anastasia staff member was so professional at her job and went out of her way for us I would highly recommend this lovely lady
226793,Park Plaza London Park Royal, No fried eggs or sunny side eyes for breakfast when asked i was told it would cost 6 50 absolutely crazy We were put in a disable friendly room not nice Our room was next to the exit door that was constantly slamming could not sleep The hotel cancelled 10 parking ticket for this not good enough, Love the bed decoration
226794,Park Plaza London Park Royal, The food was not up to par was the only downside Cooked breakfast did not taste good and both me and partner left more than half a plates worth, The hotel was fantastic Clean friendly staff good location and great rooms 
226795,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Our stay was to short , It was a beautiful hotel we couldn t fault it and in a very convenient location Our room was luxurious with all mod cons Our dining experience was also really pleasant and relaxing the food was delicious The waitresses were very helpful Only sorry we couldn t stay longer

226799,Park Plaza London Park Royal, 1 Marked parking only for 40 vehicles yet hotel has 211 rooms where s the extra spaces 2 Be careful not to place money card into car park machine which is for visitors not residents 3 Layout of split wardrobes clothes section could be improved with a shelves in the bottom of the wardrobe 4 Bathroom shaving mirror should be of extendable type as too far away from basin 5 Table top ironing board should have instructions 6 The desk chair seating height cannot be changed 7 The room menu does not encourage healthy eating as both the full English breakfast and the Continental breakfast are the same price, 1 Bed was very comfortable 2 Staff were attentive and responsive
226800,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Travelling into London was a bit tiring each day and quite far away from other destinations , Extremely friendly staff fantastic room size with comfortable bed and large tv Showers were also fantastic Right next to Park Royal tube station 
226801,Park Plaza London Park Royal,No Negative, Recommandation A CCTV camera to watch the pedestrian way under the Bridge between Tube Station Park Royal and Hotel would be great to feel more safe especially at night 
226802,Park Plaza London Park Royal, TV in the room was complicated and lost signal after a few hours and didn t work rest of our stay Staff attempted to fix it but with no luck Were offered a room swap but given we were only staying one night it didn t feel worth it Perhaps expected of a new hotel however for the price we were paying it should have worked The breakfast offering could have been better , Generally a well presented new hotel with cool and contemporary interiors The room was of very of good size and comfortable Staff were brilliant

226805,Park Plaza London Park Royal, The airco is often not felt as the sun is shining right into the room Cleanliness in the room was below the level of a 4 star hotel Even after mentioning it to the Room Division Manager we could see the difference however it was still not completely clean Finding a hair in my breakfast plate was all but fun It took my appetite away , Location of the hotel Jill the room division manager and Tara from the front office The room and its amenities were wonderful The staff was friendly and you could definitely notice that the hotel was brand new Park Plaza is most definitely a chain to recommend 
226806,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Well Hotel is in industrial zone so there is nothing to be seen Which do not make it negative because hotel is excellent from inside , Hotel is excellent rated 4 stars and definitely worth it Comfy bed good service quality experience Next to Park Royal metro station 25 minutes from Central London Staff is positive helpful They offered us our luggage to stay later than our check out which helped us to walk around the city without any problem in our last day of the visit 
226807,Park Plaza London Park Royal, As the systems were brand new the check in process was a little slow but wasn t a big issue Car park is a little small and cramped worth getting there early if you can , Brand new hotel so everything new and shiny Great price and good location Will return when I am back in the area
226808,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Location is good because it s close to a tube station and cinema But the views are awful , Brand new hotel looks like they only just removed the wrapper I didn t use it but gym looks good

226810,Park Plaza London Park Royal, That we couldn t stay longer, The rooms were so lovely with Sky Tv and movies The sort of hotel room that you don t want to leave Tube station is opposite the hotel for easy access to central London Also a complex with a cinema and places to eat within easy walking distance 
226811,Park Plaza London Park Royal, Can t answer this question because i loved everything, I really enjoyed my stay there Everything was clean and staff very nice I definitely come back
226812,Park Plaza London Park Royal, 1 We arrived at 2pm time that is possible to check in we got told to wait as cleaner is cleaning our room this is ridiculous as they have 12 14 to clean what was worse is that more than 10 groups and couples arrived in that time and got checked in immediately so we waited at reception and got told to sit and itd take 15mins max We ended up waiting ONE HOUR We were very disappointed as a 4star hotel should be better organised 2 In the morning i was just out of the shower and my partner was asleep and i hear our room door opening and its the cleaner They came in before check out time approx 9 30 10am I was absoulutely outraged I was in my underwear getting changed when the staff completely intruded our privacy This is not a 4star service and id advise anyone plannnig to stay here to not even bother The image of the place isnt even close to the representation of the service I told the reception about the cleaner coming in and she didnt even seem surprised She said im sorry about that and that theyll investigate Ive had no contact from them and doubt i will Horrible experience , Decor of hotel
