502416,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, To be honest cannot think of a negative , The staff were very good Facilities were modern and clean Welcome pack adds to the experience and hope the hotel retains this 
502417,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Room was on the ground floor and very noisy not from a bar but the utility room opposite which staff seemed to use from very early in the morning We was woken at 6am by noise I think the hotel must know this room is particularly noisy and should avoid putting guests opposite room105 , Staff helpful and nice extras like mini bottles of cava on arrival and free portable phone charger
502418,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, When I booked the hotel Booking offered free breakfast the hotel did Not honor it , Location was perfect outside of the crazy mess of the city center 
502419,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, a lot 1 they sale a basement room without properly informing you on it the title is sous terrain which in dutch means basement go figure that out so we paid a lot for a stay in a room underground would never have choose that room if i would have known it has a small window you can see people feet passing by 2 the breakfast is pretty skimpy when stuff run outs they don t auto fill it you have to ask them to do so and it runs out pretty quickly also stuff comes out slowly when you order it from the kitchen it seems it doesn t keep up with the amount of guests the coffee itself was great and fast 3 the bathroom isn t sound isolated from the room the door itself isn t blocking the entire entrance and it s a bit transparent , The location was good there is a tram just outside but given that this is Amsterdam this is not that much The hotel is nicely decorated but if you are vegan stir away as they really like leather there 
502420,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, We arrived to the property very early and although i know a room is not guranteed for early check in i felt like the lady assisting us didn t even check and said no due to the time There was dirt marks on the carpet and when they came to clean te room the side of the bed wasnt even hoovered The A C wasnt great We arrived to a half empty mini bar , I liked the location Also told the staff it was my birthday and they surprised us with a bottle of prosecco and b day cake 
502421,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Too much security guests need an access key to get to your room Mini bar wasnt refilled upon clean up Small rooms 26 euro for a very basic breakfast , Friendly staff The drinks on the bar in the lobby are good Ask for signature drink Has a corporate feel 
502422,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Staff attitude was a bit off at times Bar supposedly open until 12 but when got there at 11 we were told there are no cocktails before we d asked or even said hello and when we asked for coffees were told they just cleaned the coffee machine for the night Didn t bother using the restaurant after that Had to request water for room as wasnt there when checked in had to ask for room clean as hadnt been done by 1 1 30 when we got back from morning out Not what we d call boutique luxury service , Near museums and Albert Cuyt market Good bars and restaurants nearby
502423,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Nothing It was perfect , My stay was perfection The coffee and breakfast was so delicious and fresh The staff was incredible Especially AJ at the bar My room was spotless and the mini bar was a wonderful touch The location was great 10 minute walk to everything and the 4 tram stop right outside the door I will stay at Hotel Knotting Hill again when I return to Amsterdam 
502424,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, A little more care needs to be taken when the bathroom is cleaned Under rum of the sink it was grubby judging by the dust collected on the soapy deposits it had not been wiped down in a while , Location decor friendly helpful staff I had a double aspect single which made it feel larger And love the touch of free water Nespresso pods 
502425,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The service at the hotel restaurant was quite poor , Great room very large and very clean We were able to fit a crib and still have a ton of space to move around Great location a little far from Dam Square and the hustle and bustle of the city but that was a perk Everything is walkable and there is a Tram stop right in from of the hotel The area that the hotel is in was lovely and had a really great market a couple of blocks away 
502426,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Our room was left open by cleaners while we were out not happy about that as anyone could have gone in and it left our belongings very vulnerable The reception staff were very apologetic and they did give us 2 x free breakfasts 2 x drinks and some chocolates by way of apology They spoke to the cleaners who had also left dirty towels all over the bathroom floor half drunk drinks not ours on the coffee table and the following day we received a bath towel with huge holes in it We didn t bother reporting the holey towel as we were leaving the next day , Reception staff were very helpful and polite
502427,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The bathroom is quirky It is a large beautiful marble bathroom with a large shower and separate bath tub Unfortunalty it has a large opening window over the tub that opens into the bedroom No glass in the opening but a wooden shutter only not very soundproof It is like using a bathroom in a public facility Not sure if all the rooms have this same design , Excellent location right next to a canal Five minute walk to the huge street market cafes 10 15 min walk to Heineken Experience and 20 min walk to Van Gogh Museum The local tram stops in front of the hotel Staff very friendly and helpful Hotel very modern You have to use your door key to turn on the power for lights and AC When you leave your room for the day all power is cut off when you take your room key with you 
502428,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The wifi didn t always work well from our room but was great from the lounge , Staff were gracious facility was terrific We each stayed in a subterranean room and it was an excellent bargain I would definitely stay here again 
502429,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, In an attic room no windows Very stuffy Bathroom awkward shape Toilet opposite the bed with a glass door Can be uncomfortable at times , Comfy bed Beautiful pillows Spacious room 
502430,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The food court of been cooked properly only had a couple of pizzas no one els in the restaurant at the time and when the food arrived it was still freezing cold in the centre I m actually amazed how the chef managed to burn most of the top yet still surve it undercooked , Good location amazing staff on reception and large clean room 
502431,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Attic room had some non stop noise neither lift or some maintenance room , Attic room was super cozy we liked everything bathrobes and slippers was a bonus after all day travel 
502432,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, breakfast could be a little bit different each day , the location is just beside canal and tram station hotel was not crowded sing the mini bar is free of charge staff are helping with everything food quality is very good our room had 3 Windows lots af ight and scenery to enjoy beds are comfortable 
502433,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, A real little gem in the city Tram stops just a few steps away from the hotel and the reception staff are friendly and very helpful Beautifully appointed bedrooms with quality bed linen spacious bathroom and a real bonus is the complimentary minibar with soft drinks and snacks Great menu in the restaurant and lovely cocktails and drinks selection in the stylish bar 
502434,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Terrace was disappointing Would be nice if they had a map with other restaurants and other things of interest shown, Tram was right across the street Check in and all staff were excellent including the restaurant Great stay
502435,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Excellent location and the tram stop is just across from the hotel making it easy to access all parts of Amsterdam All the staff are friendly and the room was excellent Our room overlooked the tram stop but we never heard any noise Excellent restaurants in walking distance Zazas was fantastic and well worth a visit We stumbled across Bazar a middle eastern restaurant only 5 minutes walk from the hotel The food was excellent and great value for money 
502436,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Pillows a bit big , Excellent service helpful and friendly Room was well designed good lighting in the bathroom free mini bar and everything that you could need was provided Lift large and fast WiFi fast and reliable On the tram route into the centre Restaurant service and quality of food were the best I have had for a long while Would definitely stay again Thank you for a great return to Amsterdam
502437,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Give me a basement room with the view in at messy and dirty backstage the bathroom door is damage and its glass door it s dangerous to use I requested to change the room they said room is full all client checked in after an hour I m still see some new client checking in,No Positive
502438,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Everything about this hotel was excellent The rooms were comfortable including the beds Every staff member was friendly and helpful I highly recommend 
502439,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The room very dark and couldn t open windows hotel not particularly exciting , Easy to walk in to centre and tram stop outside Slippers and dressing gown for use was nice the shower room was wonderful Comfy bed 
502440,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The beds were vey narrow and the mattress on the very cheap side more like a rather large lightweight pad The d cor was unimaginative and there was no means of securing the water in the wash basin , The staff were v pleasant and efficient the breakfast excellent with wonderful choice The room was of an acceptable size 
502441,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, No complaints, The hotel is about 15min walk from the central station of Amsterdam Room and bathroom looking brand new I had no problems with the noise level and from the street even though it s busy on the road I will absolutely recommend this hotel
502442,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Deposit of 100 euro which they take off your credit card but is not put back immediately after check out and takes up to 5 days So paid cash deposit and picked up on departure , Good location clean and air conditioning important as was very hot in Amsterdam
502443,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The lighting made it very difficult to apply makeup , The staff was extremely nice helpful from the desk clerks to the wait staff to housekeeping 
502444,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Brekkie is expensive at 2 euro each Tram No 4 goes from Central Station to the front door of hotel but this information was not on website we went around the houses to get there Staff were lovely 
502445,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The Checkout process was clunky with them having to swipe my card for the final charge The AC turned off when I removed the room key so I returned to a hot room , The overall experience was very good The check in was smooth and we were promptly led to our room I would give the overall aesthetic a 9 and the location a 10 Requests were attended to immediately and I definitely appreciated the demeanor of all the employees 
502446,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, The bed and the room were very comfortable despite the small room size The high quality bath robe room slippers and complimentary drinks in the room s bar fridge were nice touches to the overall experience The hotel was also conveniently located opposite the Stadhouderskade tram stop for the No 4 tram line We would recommend Notting Hill for those who are keen to experience independent boutique hotels which are not associated to a major chain or hospitality brand and are more than capable to stand on their own 
502447,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The air conditioning control is set behind the combination closet and wet bar This unit must have been added after the building was renovated The thermostat was very difficult to see and manage , The property was bright and for the most part very quiet The staff was amazing 
502448,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, aircondition wasnt good and u cant open awindow wifi wasnt working most of the time, the loction us exelent 2 meters of the tram station u are in the dam square in 15 min the hotel is clean the stuff was very friendly the bar and the food was good every day they put 3 miniral water and sopt drinks in the minibar free of charge we faced two problems 1 they forced us to pay as we arrived for the all week 2 the wifi in the room didnt work all the other facilites were good the value for the money was great
502449,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, View from the room was the courtyard where the bikes were parked Couldn t really have the blinds up as no privacy at all The breakfast seemed overpriced 7 euros 50 for a croissant and a bread roll with jam and butter The breakfast staff didn t appear very friendly , Comfortable bed Friendly staff working on the bar at night Clean rooms nicely decorated Nice walk along the canal from the hotel to the centrum Close to tram stop 
502450,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Nothing, The staff were fantastic and the bed was super comfortable It had a special feel Tram 4 7 and 10 right outside so you can easily get about no matter what the weather throws at you
502451,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The toilet door is a bit odd a little lack of privacy Didn t affect my stay but I can see why some people wouldn t like it, Absolutely stunning room
502452,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The staff were nice but didn t give sufficiently specific recommendations where to go for a cup of coffee for example especially since they specifically said they would do this Also while nice the hotel was very expensive for what it was even by big expensive city standards Paris London NYC , The location of the property is excellent in terms of public transportation and walkability 
502453,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The room we got not sure if we checked enough in advance was in floor 1 minus one That s probably why we saw it at a lower rate So it has a small window showing the walking feet of passersby behind the shades It was not so bad as it first seemed but there were no views and that s a definite minus , The room we had was well sized and with good facilities The bed was very comfortable The staff was very kind and helpful The hotel is clean and well kept The location is also great Very easy to get around with the trams and at a reasonable walking distance from rembrandtplein 
502454,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, I didn t eat breakfast at the hotel, I didn t eat breakfast at the hotel but did eat in the evening The food was excellent and the service attentive The room was great although the lift was out of order on our first day the four floor climb was okay but could have been troublesome for someone less capable 
502455,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Lift not working broken toilet seat noisy room and bathroom light lights up whole room at night though glass door Not geared around a restful stay Would think twice about returning hotel is big on form much less on function , The Booking com description in Dutch of Souterrain means that the room is underground The small window that is there is at exhaust pipe level on the busy road so VERY noisy
502456,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, The hotel was clean and more than adequate Not fancy or pretentious but comfortable The staff were extremely helpful and obliging The location is central and very convenient 
502457,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Everything was good The breakfast is alittle less than 4 star hotel Also there is just one elevator in hotel that in the morning we had some issues for going down
502458,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The downside of the location is that the hotel is situated on a major street with a tram line therefore not so quiet Our first room on the groung floor facing the backyard didn t receive the traffic noise but a much worse sound from the garden probably from the building s ventilation There are fancy iluminated bedside light switches which we had to cover with papers when we went to sleep The blinds were not very effective against the morning light , The staff was very helpful We received an upgrade When there was a minor problem see below they changed our room on top of the upgrade The location is very covenient The bed is very comfortable 
502459,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, no beer in the free mini bar information on which train and tram you need to catch to get to the property when giving details about taxi s , there was no one point that made the stay so good it was the hole stay from arriving the worm welcoming on the desk the booking in was easy information by the staff about the area transport entertainment 
502460,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, We were in the basement which meant it didn t have a view it was also quite noisy road noise and I think we must have been below the bar as you could hear lots of noise from glasses bottles being moved around,No Positive
502461,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Nothing This room was great , I chose to stay here for my birthday The staff was very welcoming and sincere I probably enjoyed that the most The bed was suuuuuuper comfortable This is a very classy hotel to stay at I thought the bathroom and shower were very cool even though I didn t use it The staff behind the bar were awesome They played great music Those girls were really fun to talk to especially the interns who were just starting out They made my stay very pleasant 
502462,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Room was in the basement so only had a small window high up which you couldn t see out of Shower pressure was not great I think the shower head needs de scaling Shower door was not a tight seal so water sprayed onto the floor , Great staff at the check in desk who were very helpful Easy to get a taxi but also able to walk into the nice streets of Amsterdam Nice bar to have an evening night cap Great individual personal feel to the hotel feel rather than the feeling you have when staying in the one of the big hotel chains 
502463,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Check in was quick and room was ready when we arrived early Very friendly staff Buffet breakfast was very nice Location is excellent you could walk everywhere or tram right outside hotel door 
502464,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, I forgot my sweater in the closet called that same afternoon to see if I could come back to pick it up but was told I had to e mail them about my inquiry about my sweater Three days later the hotel e mailed me back saying that they found no sweater left in the closet I know for a fact that s where I left the sweater as it was our first stop in Europe Very disappointed that one of their staff would take my sweater and keep it , Hotel was in a good location modern clean rooms which were a decent size for European standards
502465,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The shampoo and the bath gel did not smell good and the shampoo dried my hair I think they should switch their supplier , The accomodation was very comfortable The staff were very helpful and took my shopping deliveries made to the hotel prior to my arrival I m very thankful to them 
502466,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Nothing , Great location Room was cleaned well and staff was amazing Breakfast was really good a lot of options I definitely give this place five thumbs way up 
502467,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Restaurant at the hotel isn t that good for dinner But a lot of nice restaurants in the surroundings, Location was perfect Staff very friendly and helpfull Rooms really nice Parking nearby
502468,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, We paid EUR 227 to give us a small room in the basement Loud noise from the air conditioner without being turned on All night we heard steps and doors close tight , Good breakfast 
502469,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The view was not nice but we kept our windows closed , Service was real good and the room was very comfortable Big tub as well as a shower I brought home cooked meals for my one yr old and the stuff helped us keep them refrigerated and warmed them up when we needed them 
502470,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, The room was fab very modern with a free mini bar and nepresso machine who can complain They also gave you robes and slippers to make you feel extra fancy after your fabulous shower They had little favours everywhere in our room which really makes your stay here special It is a little out from the centre walk wise but with the no4 tram outside the door u can hop on and off it outside all the main areas it was amazing I would recommend getting a ticket that would do you the length of your stay because its 3 euros a pop and you would be surprised how it can tot up Also literally minutes walk to the sign museums and heineken experience And in all i reckon I would stay here again 
502471,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The breakfast was a bit of a disappointment It tasted good but the serving staff where not particularly welcoming or attentive Which is a shame as that was the biggest let down of the stay , The hotel is a little way out of the mix of things but the tram is right outside and so easy to use We walked every time we went anywhere but did get the tram back to the central station The hotel is lovely classy and clean The staff were amazingly helpful also providing a map and marking any areas you have an interest in Check in was seemless bags were taken and stored and then put in our room The room was spacious and clean The hotel leaves 2 small bottles of wine complimentary and a small fridge with bottled water fresh orange Diet Coke and pringles There are lots of good restaurants located near the hotel we had the most amazing steak at an Argentinian restaurant en route to Rembrandt Square I would highly recommend this hotel
502472,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The room was certainly big enough for a sofa which I think would have been a nice addition The main downside for us was that the bathroom was next to the bed area and didn t have a proper door it was like a shower door so didn t close properly or have a lock and didn t allow for any privacy when you needed to use it There wasn t a bath but the shower was large and had a rain shower head which was lovely , Situated outside the busier areas of Amsterdam but not too far to walk to Staff were very helpful On check out day they stored all our luggage for us after check out so we didn t have to carry it with us all day We had an attic room which was very spacious and clean Complimentary prosecco on arrival robes and slippers a fridge stocked with non alcoholic drinks and snacks for free which was restocked for free daily and a selection of teas and coffees We didn t eat any meals in the restaurant but the cocktails were nice Some great places to eat nearby HIGHLY recommend Bakers and Roasters in De Pijp for breakfast lunch Fabulous food and atmosphere Also Zaza s restaurant for evening meals which was amazing and a superb price for the quality of the food Would recommend booking a table to avoid disappointment as it is a small place 
502473,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Small issues bathroom door did not close remote light controls too complex and the bathroom light came on randomly during the night but fault was quickly fixed when reported , Excellent location in easy walking distance of the Rijksmuseum Van Gogh Museum canal tours and many restaurants Pleasant uncluttered room overlooking the canal Very helpful desk staff 
502474,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Bathroom was well appointed but marble floor was a bit slippery when wet felt a bit like an ice rink , Very spacious downstairs room very comfortable and quiet with huge bathroom with big bath Liked the free mini bar cokes orange juice and Pringles free Liked that Number 4 tram stops right outside the front door of hotel And liked that tbe hotel is only 5 mins walk from Heinecken brewery 2 mins walk from Albert Cuypstraat street market and 10 mins walk from Rijksmuseum
502475,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Our room was in the basement so only a small window to let in light Would have preferred a room with a view Also would have been better if breakfast was included in the price , Good location Everything was within easy reach Room was really spacious and comfortable with free soft drink mini bar Staff were really helpful 
502476,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, I loved this hotel It s elegant and has a wonderful vibe to it The staff are amazing and very welcoming and they know how to make you feel special The happy hour at their bar is just perfect as they offer cocktails that are so nice and for just 5 5 Euro The mattress owh what can i say about that they invested in these mattresses as they have Memory foam Mattresses which makes you feel like you are sleeping on clouds For me i actually don t prefer these kind of mattresses as they are too soft for my back as i have back problems so i do actually prefer firm mattresses but i didn t mind sleeping on it for one night The furniture decore is just wonderful and feels posh The bathroom has a wonderful rainfall shower and great basin The offer toothbrush paste which i find very handy for someone who is on the move This kind of service wasn t even offered by Movinpeckhotel The hotel is also very close to shops and amazing restaurants all around The tram is just couple of steps from the hotel The view from my room wasn t much but i knew about this as i didn t book the room that faces the canals i was on the 1st floor but you need to keep in mind some rooms are in the top floor or the basement therefore these rooms might not even have a good view and might be smaller with no windows hince some of the reviews here that might seem misleading 
502477,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, We had breakfast on the first morning but it s expensive and not very good so did not bother again The tiny bar area is lovely but closes early which is a shame , The room was really clean and a really comfortable bed Room was cleaned daily good wifi and good air con 
502478,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Actually the room seemed very well cleaned however once my earring fell down and I had to look for it and detected a finger or toenail cut on the carpet in middle of the room which did not belong to us This was a bit gross and does not testify of diligent hoovering , The location of the hotel is fantastic Every part the old city part as well as the more modern and hip city parts are reachable by foot This is truly great 
502479,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Wifi connection is a little annoying Signal is strong but the password always wrong I think the router has something wrong Even they rebooted and still disconnected I have two cell phones and I kept trying for hours The problem was weird actually ,No Positive
502480,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The hotel is slightly more expensive but I guess Amsterdam in general is expensive , The location is great and the staff is lovely The rooms are spacious and clean The free minibar and welcome sparkling wine was awesome 
502481,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The bathroom door was a nightmare It was difficult to close it without making a noise Something we noticed from neighbouring rooms late at night sadly I asked for a quiet room There was not a sound from outside but you could hear noise from doors when trying to sleep Not great for an insomniac like myself , The bed was amazing The room was comfortable and spacious The staff were very pleasant and helpful We loved the food in the restuarant Particularly our evening meals Drinks in the bar were good and reasonable priced 
502482,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Restaurant staff serving breakfast were rubbish messed up food order constantly returned asking which room number we were staying in Full English breakfast was overlooked burnt , Reception staff very helpful informative
502483,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Lovely boutique hotel was about 4 tram stops away from the huddle and busses of Dam Square but had a tram stop right outside The staff were really helpful and the rooms very clean and comfortable 
502484,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Our toom was a bit too humid and the windows were sealed We couldn t let some fresh air in It was also a bit chilly unles you turn the AC on but it also turned on automatically during the night so we had to get up and regulate the mode do that the temperature was comfortable The price was a little bit too high but considering the rates in Ansterdam we are lucky we ve got a good deal, We liked the design and the equipment in our room The bathroom was very large like another bedroom We stayed in deluxe room though 
502485,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, This hotel is overpriced for the 4 stars since the breakfast is simply a nightmare the sink in the bathroom was not cleaned well Besides was my room on the ground floor very noisy and i could hear charis moving The minibar had two bottles of water and two soda cans also not worth the price and ranking All overall i would expect more from a 4 star hotel and their employees , All overall is the concept very nice but thats just on the face of it 
502486,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Rooms at the basement are so bad Basement rooms are dark and noisy Hotel bar is closed after certain hour, Location Polite staff Clean rooms
502487,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Breakfast is not value for money seriously overpriced , The room are very stylish with a comfortable bed and a nice bathroom with a rain shower 
502488,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, No window in attic room and the air con was very poor and needs updating to fit in with modern room, Re supplied mini bar daily clean room staff extremely helpful excellent location 
502489,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, We were quoted 20 each for breakfast which we declined but after a few days we discovered thre was an a la carte menue So you can breakfast to suite your appetite pocket , The No 4 tram stops right outside the door so the location is great Restaurants in De Pijp are within walking distance hotel bar is friendly reasonably priced 
502490,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Unfortunately there were hairs in our shower when we checked in The wifi isnt very efficient The pillows are very uncomfortable, The staff were all very nice and helpful
502491,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Deluxe canal view room was very small and windows did not open The bathroom has a shutter opening into the bedroom that did not provide privacy or sound insulation The bathroom door was frosted glass and did not align to the door jamb to close properly Amenities were fairly basic and a little disappointing for a room at this price , Friendly staff and good location
502492,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Staff delivered our luggage to the wrong guests had a search party go find it Not the greatest location for Amsterdam Parking comes at a steep cost 40 hotel not a value choice in general , Clean comfortable with modern amenities Decent food and bar Parking available in nearby private garage Nice staff 
502493,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Arrived late and were told no food was available 10pm to be precise I m really surprised that nothing was on offer so we had to settle for peanuts in the bar not impressed by the reception staff s attitude and a bit stand offish asked for a late checkout to make things easier as our flight wasn t till 6pm and was told that it would cost us 10 euros per hour wow Really surprised as we had spent near on 800 euros inc drinks meals and 3 nights stay would have expected better Overall a really nice hotel very friendly and helpful bar and breakfast staff and they deserve credit where it s due Reception staff did move us to another room at our request due to our room being noisy with traffic at the front rear room not as nice but much quieter , Cooked breakfast was piping hot one day but cold the next day and they cooked it fresh confused 
502494,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, I wish there was a bath but I know it is not as common in Europe, Very stylish Comfortable stay Very welcoming and convenient Staff were Approachable and incredibly accommodating when it came to sightseeing and the bar
502495,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Very petty separate shampoo and conditioner bottles for toiletries rather than the all in one bottles would be great Larger towels would be better but there were nice thick robes anyway , Mini bar in room with soft drinks and a nespresso machine Lovely high end decor and fixtures English TV channels 
502496,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The room we were in would work better with black out blinds as the light was quite bright at 6 oclock in the morning even with the blinds down We were going to have breakfast but didnt realise that it closed at 10am, Location Style
502497,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The pillows were far too large I couldn t sleep waking with a really stiff neck shoulder for 2 nights it s still painful now I m home ,No Positive
502498,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Checking at 3 pm jejejee but the staff take care my luggage that helps a lot thanks for that, Hotel location the room is perfect comfy bed and refrigerator refills all days is awesome
502499,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, I don t think that it was great value for money We were in an attic room and it was good towels weren t very big at all and quite crusty Not much light but This was probably because of the fact the room was in the attic, Bed was comfortable and location was good for what we wanted 
502500,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The cleaning could have been better It is pretty dark in the room that is why the housekeeping might not notice some spots Half of the towels have unpleasant smell During my first stay I had used vanity kit in my room and the lights would not change for 3 days During the second stay I had torn bed sheets and used pillow case However when the issue is raised to the hotel staff it in most of the cases it is solved the same day There are no shelves in the room had to put underwear and sportswear in the bedside case , I like the way to the office from the hotel which is why I chose to stay in this hotel twice The interior is nice and I like the fitness room The staff is helpful and they brought a yoga mat upon request Kettle coffee machine and iron in the room are very convenient 
502501,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Beware deposit is required on arrival and full payment if you do not have a credit card , The hotel is quite far away from centraal but only a few tram stops Infact quite a nice walk and nice to leave the tourist area Staff were lovely 
502502,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Staff made your stay here special from the handwritten welcome note to the specially prepared cocktails by Tom it was an absolute pleasure to stay here would definitely recommend 
502503,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Very nice hotel with clean and cozy rooms The hotel staff were extremely helpful The location is code to the city center 15 20 minutes walk but there is a metro station just outside the hotel 
502504,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The public toilets in the reception area could have been cleaner , The complementary mini bar and drinks vouchers were a lovely bonus Excellent clean and very comfortable bed I would definitely stay again 
502505,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Very nice modern hotel well situated in what seems to be a less crowded area 25min walk to the city center Excellent hotel for business travelers 
502506,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, beds might have been more comfortable pillows were huge also hotel is quite far from the station and city center so you better get comfortable shoes, Staff were extremely friendly and helpful We ordered some food from the restaurant and it was fantastic Room was very clean and quite spacious
502507,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Comfy bed quirky character helpful staff clean and great toiletries in the bathroom Although a little out of the way of the main hustle and bustle of the city centre there is a tram stop right outside that will connect you wherever you need to go We walked everytime as its only a 20 minute walk so Centraal Station so really not far 
502508,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Check in receptionist wasn t so welcoming A little bit wooden BATHROOM DOORS in bedrooms are complete DISASTER They are frosted glass with clear glass around the surround Absolutely no privacy in ensuite and spoiled my stay at this lovely hotel a bit, Bed and pillows were very comfortable Tram 4 from central station stops right outside hotel which is perfect It s quiet and away from hussle and bustle but easy to get to centre of things
502509,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Pillows on the bed are too big for sleeping on it s like I was siting up whilst sleeping Upon arrival at 12pm we couldn t check in to our room until 3pm we were very tired and just wanted to sleep but instead we had to walk around town for 3 hours Also food menu is not the best could do with more everyday types of food like burgers or pizzas , Great shower Also liked the way they refill the mini bar when cleaning room and that it s free 
502510,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The windows didn t open and the room was a noisy with air con at night even though we thought we had turned it off The service in the bistro bar for breakfast was very slow however the English breakfast was delicious when it eventually arrived and kept us going all day, The room was spotlessly clean the bed was very comfortable and the free mini bar and excellent coffee machine which was topped up daily was an extra nice touch Staff were courteous and helpful
502511,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Price of breakfast is too high especially considering the room cost If hotels hike prices for special events they should include breakfast as part of the deal , Staff were exceptional room very comfortable croissants were too flaky Gift in room was a very nice touch 
502512,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Opted for larger attic room only downside is having no window a little weird but was explained when booking, Fantastic freindly hotel with Great staff convieient possition opposite NO 4 tram direct to and from train station And great value in comparison to other city hotels I would recommend 
502513,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Would be nice if the beds were a little bigger The free wifi drops off pretty often You may get a complimentary mini bar of soft drinks Enjoy cocktail hour at the bar downstairs but don t expect to find any comfy seats, Slightly further out from the main bustle but the trams give plenty of options and actually most attractions are a pleasant walk away anyway 
502514,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Was put in a basement room very cold and at front of hotel onto street Noisy due to trams and people walking by all night Shower door didn t close properly mini bar cabinet door didn t close properly Room just felt a bit run down All in all disappointing stay here whenever i m in Amsterdam and always been impressed but fell short this time Will stay again but will insist I don t get a basement room , Staff great good location dinner great 
502515,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The fact everyone I traveled with had a problem with the hotel and the rudeness of some of the staff when we rang up to check the booking and the 200 took off my card when they only said 100 be took off Was bad service before we even arrived in Amsterdam, Bed
502516,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Amazing Wouldn t change , The staff was so kind and helpfull Great service beautiful room Wifi was working most of the time Every time we left they cleaned up the room perfectly 
502517,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Bathroom lock broken dirty towels left in room no wifi when it s advertised Rude staff not willing to help and took two hundred deposit, Hotel was really nice decor was beautiful and security was good too 
502518,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Don t take the 800 rooms Located at the basement with no firm wi fi near to the staff rooms we ordered 1 rom for Two business partners asking for seperate beds but got Two beds connected that have to be seperate by our selves There is no real door at the toilet so it was not comfortoble to use the toilets when you are Two partners the rooms are quite small We rent a car and thought that the parking is free to the hotel guest however it was very expanssive almost 40 Eur per day, good breakfast good location
502519,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, 3pm was a small bit late to check in as we arrived to Amsterdam at 10am but they allowed us to leave our luggage at least , The hotel was extremely modern and clean The room was lovely and the bed was amazingly comfortable The staff were very friendly and helpful So close to the city centre too 
502520,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, There were issues with a few things in our room and it took addressing it with the front desk twice before they were taken care of , Comfortable bed staff was very nice and helpful great location
502521,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The wifi was a problem throughout It was difficult to connect to even with help from the staff and it was haphazard throughout the stay The staff were eager to help but on two different occasions gave us information that was not helpful The first was to send us to a restaurant which needed a taxi ride without letting us know reservations were needed They were unable to accommodate us and we had to look elsewhere The second was to give inaccurate information about the timing of canal cruises which cost us the opportunity to see the city by boat in daylight before we left , The beds were really comfy The staff very friendly and eager to help 
502522,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Judgemental staff that looked down on me because I had training clothes on as they re more comfortable for travelling as if I wasn t meant to be there as if I wasn t up to scratch which is rich coming from a receptionist but whatever hotel good staff stuck up pricks, Nice rooms nice d cor
502523,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, I have booked based on the enthusiastic feedback of previous travellers The room was nothing special I have chosen a room with Canal View in reality the hotel is located at a corner with a big road and bridge so there is absolutely not the typical canal view atmosphere of other places nearby The furniture in the room are quite normal nothing special if you think this is classified as a boutique hotel It seemed an hotel belonging to an hotel chain In term of location is quite near to the museums are and with 15 20 minutes walking from the canal area , The room was clean and ready at our arrival 11 30 AM 
502524,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Nothing at all , Everything Absolutely wonderful stay there is not one thing I could fault All staff were as friendly as could be the hotel was beautiful and in a very good spot I was extremely impressed with the fact they decorated the bedroom with balloons for my partners birthday such a lovely touch Most importantly The bed was unbelievably comfortable I m sad to be home and in my own uncomfortable bed I will definitely stay here again and or recommend to anybody else visiting Amsterdam 
502525,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Dingy lighting in room Windows are sealed shut so can t get any fresh air , Staff were charming very helpful Room was extremely comfortable had nice extras bathrobes coffee maker free soft drinks in mini bar etc Room was well sound proofed 
502526,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, The hotel was just lovely and the room was cozy It was our first time in Amsterdam and we truly enjoyed it The area was the ideal location We were also really close to many places we wanted to go 
502527,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Only problem for me was that wall isolation is poor and it can be quite noisy at the room in the morning if ppl in room next to you are early birds , Good food great chill out atmosfere in the lobby helpfull service big thanks for the reception guy who give me the beers from closed bar when coming back late at night from city center basket with prosseco and chocolates on first day was a nice suprise Free mini bar with non alkoholic drinks was a life saver next day twice Tram stop next to hotel which take 15 minutes to get to city center Walking distance from party districts as well as other atractions 
502528,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Was quite disappointed with the location Its advertised as city centre but was a taxi ride away from everywhere ended up costing a fortune , The bed was something else probably the comfiest bed we ve ever stayed in 
502529,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, I paid for the hotle as soon as i had got there Then he said that we needed to put a 100 euro deposit down what wasn t the best but i thought ok Then after that he comes over and said by the way i deposited 100 euro before you came ive just realised it i mean what was the point in that essentially i paid for the hotel that wasn t ceap then another 200 euro pending out of my account Wasnt told that this would happen by booking com needs to be communicated better between consumers booking com and the hotel not good enough Had rubbish information that the fireworks for new year started at 11pm The hotel looks clean but dont drop anything down the back of you bed table and pull it out you will find that its never been cleaned, The bed was comfortable air conditioning and heating was good lobby was nice
502530,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The pillows were a bit too big for my liking gave me a neck ache Bathroom situation is a little uncomfortable It looks great but the set up doesn t allow for any privacy when using the bathroom It would be better if there was a pane of glass between room and bathroom to afford more privacy I felt so uncomfortable using the toilet Had to use communal toilets Not very romantic to hear your partner going to the toilet , I loved the decor The staff were very friendly and helpful Complimentary mini bar is great 
502531,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Not being able to open bedroom window to let in at all Only AC to control airflow in room Not Smoker friendly forget it if u are one , A clean and proper kept Hotel run by friendly staff It has a lovely bar and Resteraunt and a very yummy breakfast Good interior in rooms Wifi free Free Minibar included
502532,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Nothing , This was my second stay at Boutique Hotel Nottinghill and it was even more wonderful than our stay last year The hotel staff are amazing the best I ve ever encountered They are very welcoming and will do about anything to make sure your happy and enjoying your time there They offer complementary drinks at their bar book visits or excursions on your behalf The hotel has a warm modern feel to it and was beautifully decorated for Christmas The food served at the brassiere was delicious I would recommend the breakfast In terms of location it s perfect the main attractions are easily accessible by tram or even walking The square is in close vicinity If you re traveling by public transport from the airport I suggest you get a train to Amsterdam Rai and then a tram to Stadhouderskade The hotel is opposite the stop the journey is around 30 minutes The rooms are immaculate and they provide free wifi I stayed in the Souterrain room which is located on the lower floor Overall this is a wonderful hotel and I would stay here again 
502533,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, One member of the bar staff was particularly rude and unhelpful the breakfast was below standard and a new member of staff was left to run the restaurant on her own resulting in poor service , Excellent location the tram stop is right outside and it s around 4 stops to central 
502534,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, There isn t anything that we didn t like Excellent quality and staff, Very clean and professional service Lovely staff helpfull and fluent English
502535,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, BREAKFAST WAS SERVED COLD AND THE SERVICE WAS POOR WITH THE AMOUNT THAT IT COST THIS SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE , THE ROOM WAS VERY CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE THE RECEPTION STAFF WERE EXCELLENT 
502536,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The bathroom had broken furniture we booked it and there were a lot of hidden charges not just the city tax which I always check but 100 deposit not mentioned anywhere I don t take my cards abroad for security reason but it states we can authorise your card for payment this was not the case as I didn t have my card with me although I had all identification that it was me Staff weren t the friendliest I would defiantly never stay again or recommend it to anyone , The lounge area was superb the room it s self was ok not the Eat bit small
502537,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Staff serving breakfast were a little slow and we always had to ask for cutlery I don t mind if staff chat amongst themselves but if a customer has to wait for attention that isn t enjoyable Bar and reception staff were very friendly and helpfull ,No Positive
502538,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Bathrooms had no locks on doors I asked for a twin room and the beds had been put together to make a double , Modern decor Friendly staff Walking distance from where I was attending a party Walking distance from tram stop
502539,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, We arrived for breakfast at 09 45h having been told it finished 10 00h we had paid for the full buffet breakfast in our 1st night room rate The buffet was completely empty tables had not been cleared The ta we were shown to had no crockery or cutlery and we had to ask on numerous occasions for tea coffee plus omelettes We had to find our own cutlery to eat with when finally served , Great orange juice and the omelettes were good when they were finally received 
502540,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, A double deluxe room didn t seem very deluxe and was very small one night stay one beer and two breakfasts came to 240 Euros in my opinion was over priced by about 100 euros Consequently would not make a return trip , Efficient nice friendly staff clean and well maintained 
502541,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Domotics in the hotel are great but at night they caused troubles Lights in the bathroom went on in the middle of the night just because there was an interference with another room Plus there were many stand by lights that would not go off , Nice and comfortable hotel Ten minutes walk to the museum square Very friendly staff 
502542,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Very clean room and eventhough it was on the street side it was very calm night Lovely staff and nice overall feeling Nice to have both shower and bath tub and the Nespresso machine was a bonus 
502543,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Hallways were a bit noisy not just guests but the cleaners also were loud , Hotel was lovely d cor was modern and elegant Room was petite but just enough room everything was as I like it Bed was comfy loved the robes and slippers Staff were very friendly and helpful especially Angelique Great location will recommend to friends and family 
502544,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The light in the bathroom was just a little dark I know this is small but it s the only thing I could think of Would have been nice to have a slightly brighter light Also not so many channels to choose from on the tv , Great room perfect location and very good breakfast Nice touch buttons for the switches 
502545,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, All in all a nice little hotel nearby the center of Amsterdam However u need some time to get to the most visited places 8min by bike 25min by foot The room is too small for what it costs But it is clean an the bed is comfortable the basics are just fine But nothing special with the room We were even a little disappointent The breakfast doesent offer a big variety but what u find there tastes really good so it gives a good start in the day Well its a nice little hotel where u can have a nice stay but next time we will definately go somewhere else It is just too expensive for what it offers 
502546,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The recommended Canal Bus which they sell tickets for and it was not the best value for the money or time The hotel restaurant and bar I would give 3 but there are excellent restaurants nearby , The staff was very helpful and went out of their way to make my birthday weekend a good one 
502547,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Breakfast Buffet was seriously overpriced Go a la carte for better value Room was poky and cold especially the bathroom though eventually they got the room warm Stupid shallow plugless sink wastes water and easy to lose contacts down No storage for 4 nights clothing for 2 people Clean up time was very late so we twice gott back at 4 30 to find a dirty room , Very nice to eat Yes the single croissant was flaky but ive never ordered a French breakfast where there was only 1 served theres usually a second viennoserie Beds were very comfy Tram stop VERY convenient Nice quiet area Friendly staff
502548,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The way you took additional costs before and after which still hasn t been refunded There should have only been one deposit not two Charging an additional 200 pound then refunding which is still not in my account is terrible, The room was lovely
502549,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The attic room although obviously cheaper is a little oppressive with lack of windows and the bathroom was a bit of a squeeze A larger person would struggle using it , The location of this hotel is perfect to discover the less touristy side of Amsterdam Quiet beautiful and surrounded by brilliant bars and restaurants frequented by locals The staff were very helpful and friendly and went out of their way to make our stay a fabulous one We can t wait to go back 
502550,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Only 2 things missing are orthopaedic pillows and gym is tiny with only 2 pieces of cardio equipment , Excellent hotel in central Amsterdam walking distance to museum district Good tram service right outside door Staff helpful and friendly purchased museum passes and made restaurant recommendations Restaurant in hotel a nice option if you want to stay in Breakfasts and coffee overpriced 
502551,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, no buzz in the hotel expected more from the feel look price one of my towels had a hole in the middle housekeeping not great and missed a few things , decent size rooms friendly welcome and check out reception staff were perfect 
502552,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The room was too noisy with trams Overall I think the rooms are over priced especially as they don t include breakfast and breakfast was very expensive, The complimentary mini bar was good Comfy beds and very clean
502553,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The breakfast was terrible Whatever we ordered we very rarely received and it took an hour for my husband to receive an omelette Such a shame as the hotel is stunning and the staff are fantastic but the breakfast waiters and chef were terrible ,No Positive
502554,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, I have asked to get late checkout at reservation At checkin the night shift confirmed it won t be a problem but still we should check with the day shift on the last day I did and he told us it s not possible then he did say it s possible for an extra 40 Euros This tells me they room was available but despite earlier promises they just wanted more money as I was running the marathon I did need a shower after the race We ended up not paying the extra 40 Eur packed in a hurry hope the staff liked the cheese we left in the minibar and had a rather uncomfortable shower in the gym Not a pleasant Experience won t return here Also the room was pretty noisy and the pillow too high but all that would have not been a real issue , Good location nice room 
502555,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, A bit more space between the bed and wardrobe , The room was lovely and clean and the facilities in the room were great however there was a lot crammed in the room which made the space between the wardrobe and the bed very tight 
502556,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Tbe lighting in the bathroom was oddly dim , The hotel is on several tram and bus routes plus close to some awesome breakfast restaurants The mini bar was restocked each day free of charge The staff were very helpful My only complaint would be the dinner menu and cost but we expected a high hotel cost so are elsewhere We were fine with the high price but the portions were very tiny Loved the room decor the big windows and the techy features
502557,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Paid nearly 100 Euro for 2 steak and chips and a couple of drinks in the londen brassiere and food was shocking Medium well steak come out dripping with blood was cooked less than rare, Bed was comfy and staff were helpfull
502558,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Pillows slightly too big but we requested thinner ones which they gave straight away And we didn t like all the modern lighting you wake up in the night and there were lots of little blue and while lights as indicators where the light switches were Too much, great location with good travel options
502559,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The room is small and the cupboard is awkwardly located The coffee maker is within the cupboard which is not convenient , This hotel has a great location and the staff is very helpful and courteous The restaurant serves a good breakfast with very prompt service 
502560,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Noisy in the evening in the hall also room facing main road and the windows are not very good so very load with all the traffic and trams going past , nice bar and reception area
502561,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Hotel is abit of a walk away from the main parts which didn t mind but can imagine but a long walk for some people but would stay again, Great hotel clean nice bar and restaurant and some great markets and shops across road 
502562,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Breakfast definitely is NOT worth the price they whack on top of the room Eat elsewhere Quite expensive if you re just planning on using this as a place to lay your head , Beautiful and welcoming hotel the rooms are furnished tastefully Location is great for people who don t want to be right in the noisy centre of Amsterdam but close enough to be in walking distance of Dam Square the Red Light District Centraal Station as well as popular sights such as the Heineken Experience and the Hard Rock Cafe 
502563,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Very modern and comfortable room Location great in walking distance of alot but very quiet Staff was very attentive and helpful Also easy location to take the tram 
502564,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Staff on check in was rude and a little unwelcoming It was demanded that I pay immediately no problem Their machine wasn t working quite right or MasterCard had put a maximum transaction amount of 500eur on my card that day still not sure exactly what happened I m a business traveller but don t look like a conventional business traveller A young woman with a few tattoos and the guy checking me in treated me like I was robbing him at gunpoint He also told me not to mention the fact I work for a successful international craft brewery within earshot of the other customers as Heineken is a big client of theirs I also decided after check in to sit and have a glass of wine on their terrace by the river beautiful terrace and a great wine list however a waitress turned up 10 mins into my drink and demanded payment quite rudely No other guest outside had been asked to do the same If you re a business MAN over the age of 40 in a cheap suit you ll get on fine if you look anything out of the ordinary I would not recommend Not welcoming at all , Beautiful room nice view over the canal Basic but nice fitness room Maid cleaning service was amazing Pop out for 10 mins for a coffee room spotless in return Best I ve seen anywhere and I travel every week 
502565,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Ladies at the reception not cooperative when it comes to wishes of the guest standard answers no empathy you don t feel really welcome Zero tolerance when it comes to slight late check out requests lame standard answers like Sorry we are fully booked etc Rooms in the basement are not worth the money the places are cheerless and have no spirit not appropriate for a boutique hotel, Well situated Good beds
502566,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, The staff were all amazing from check in bar housekeeping and everyone in between Hotel is beautiful clean and a very high standard is met everywhere in the hotel Beds are amazing 
502567,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Our room could of been cleaner we did find quite a bit of dust on our glass table and we had to bring a member of staff up into the room to examine a strange substance on our walls This was later cleaned by house keeping , extremely friend staff quiet hotel within reach of lots of experiences

502571,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, No romantic canal view from the window and location is slightly away from the main tourist attractions but one may see it as an advantage the place is quiet no crowds and garbadge on the street The price is a bit too high for what you get but we were here during the festival maybe that s why , A comfortable modern and clean hotel with very friendly professional and helpful staff Big nicely designed room with tea and coffee making facilities free mini bar and super comfortable bed Good tram connections to the city center and the central railway station tram stop is only10 m from the entrance 
502572,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, The room was bright and comfortable there were lots of little extras such as a coffee machine toiletries slippers It was about half an hour s walk to the centre of Amsterdam but a very pleasant walk and there were plenty of attractions and restaurants nearby 
502573,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, We originally got a room in the basement floor which was very depressing and with a window in the level of the sidewalk Considering the price we pay this was not acceptable The woman in the reception was understanding and with paying a little extra we got upgraded to a nice room with a view Room are slightly on the smaller side and even though the bathroom is large and nice I wish the bathroom door gave more privacy and closed like a normal door , Location and the view from the room Friendly helpful service Clean and modern Nice big bathroom Great with bike rentals at the hotel 
502574,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Below ground level room not obvious when booking Rooms poorly made daily with fresh towels but bed linen untidily pulled up , Reception area and bar restaurant very nice and clean

502576,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The terrace area was disappointing as it turned out to be a few tables and chairs on the footpath , The beds were extremely comfortable and lots of space in the bedrooms standard room Location was excellent a short walk from the Museums The stop for the canal boat tour was opposite the hotel which made it very convenient to travel around the city 
502577,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Small window and that you cannot open the horrible noise from the cooling system even when turned off which rattled all the time the unfriendliness of the person we met at reception without any knowledge nor advice about the city most basic info and not keen to be helpful either , location is good nice area and not far from museums
502578,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, On the basement floor the noise from the bar above and hotel staff was occasionally annoying Around 3 4am on one day , All the staff were very happy and helpful nothing was too much trouble The hotel was great for a family as a sofa bed was available in the room The room was clean and tidy and the 12 00 check out was really helpful if you have a later flight They also look after your bags after check out 
502579,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Nothing Had a great stay would highly recommend, We took an Attic room which I thought would be rather small but it was very spacious Clean cosy room nicely decorated reliable internet and comfortable bed Hotel 15 20 mins walk from Dam square but there is also a tram stop just outside the hotel Very close to the Heineken experience and local cafes markets less hectic and a change from the main tourist spots Staff were most helpful and welcoming
502580,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The location is not the best not in the centre and not near shops or coffee shops The rooms are small and the windows can t be open the showers are not well maintained and the price for that return is way to ridiculous Will not recommend on that hotel there are others hotel with great location cheaper than that Nothing in that hotel is special than others Basic basic basic for sure not boutique hotel , Clean the dining room is comfortable the staff are nice and helpful 
502581,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Nothing , From the welcoming to the check out we were treated extremely well Javinta at reception was extremely friendly and a great ambassador of the hotel

502587,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, It would have been nice to know beforehand that the hotel was having roofing renovations done however this did not interrupt our stay We never heard the workers , Very friendly and helpful staff The location was great as it was not far from tourist areas but far enough away to avoid tourists at all times We loved dining in the surrounding restaurants and walking along the canals 
502588,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Room view was awful overpriced as was the breakfast Poor value for money closed the terrace bar at 8pm on a beautiful evening why Scaffolding on hotel not told about it Wanted to charge an extra 75 euros a night for a better room , Staff were very friendly indeed made up for the poor room 
502589,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, We were initially put in a tiny room right next to the ground floor staff exit All afternoon while we were trying to sleep after our transatlantic flight there were laundry carts banging in and out of the door right outside our room and there were staff standing right outside our windows and then there were roofing repairmen shouting up to their coworkers on the roof After four straight hours of this I complained and they gave me a different room but charged 25 euros extra Had to move out of the new room the next night because it was booked already Really not a great experience , Rooms were clean and nicely decorated Second room was quiet but we weren t allowed to stay there for both nights 
502590,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Our room was in the seller souterrain which where expected but we did not expect the seller to be dirty and messy black carpet When we pulled up the curtains it was messy and dirty even outside the window just as in the backyard wish we could se from our corridor The feeling was really not luxury Not much of a breakfast when paying 23 50 Euros person , When we complained about the breakfast we got the money back for the next two days and also vouchers for a drink in the bar

502605,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Minor but still had maid service carts taking up half the hallway at 5 in the afternoon , Friendly English speaking staff Hotel check in was the most unique we ve experienced sitting at a desk with very personable receptionist Room was on second floor on the corner with wonderful canal view Room size was a bit small at this price but adequate Restaurant food was good breakfast buffet option for two was expensive at about 25 person but an a la carte menu was available Bar was comfort was okay with friendly bar staff and a variety of Belgian beers gins and wines available Tram stop right outside the hotel 
502606,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Breakfast was well presented but limited in scope Air conditioning was aggressive and resulted in rather dry air Perhaps some humidification would help , Very helpful staff Clean and attractive rooms and public areas 
502607,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The mini bar prices, Bed was super comfy and the bathroom was kept clean also loved the fact we were given robes and slippers and free glasses of wine on arrival
502608,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The air con didn t work and our room was boiling The wrong cash amount has been taken from my bank account without being contacted as to why The mini bar was hot and not stocked This hotel really is overpriced , The reception area looked nice

502610,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The mini bar didn t work and there was no place to keep drinks cold in the room bathroom door made of glass very little privacy , Friendliness of the staff nicely decorated convenient location to visit museums shops and the centre is not far 
502611,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Our room although comfortable was located in the basement right at the back in a small corner by a door which was in constant use even at late early hours making it very noisy The corridors in the basement floor were always busy with service trolleys and were also not as clean, Quite well located with comfortable rooms
502612,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, room was once not cleaned up it was forgotten , location is great easy to reach city center by tram tram stop in front of the hotel nice area and nice neighborhood with good restaurants

502618,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The shower is hand held and I would have preferred a small holder to place it in so I could just stand under the hot water without having to hold it up , The room was comfortable clean and well presented The breakfast was wide ranging and plentiful 
502619,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Nothing It was all good , Good size room with large window overlooking the canal Large bathroom and spotlessly clean The hotel is in a nice quiet area and just a 10 min tram ride to central station or a pretty 20 min walk along the canals 
502620,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, We had a basement room and the window was so high up it made the room a little dark You could only see the legs of people passing by , The room was lovely very spacious we accidently left our washbag at home but everything was provided even toothbrushes and toothpaste Lovely big comfortable bed Within walking distance of lots of attractions Close to the various river cruise boarding points Close to lots of shops and bars but lovely and quiet 
502621,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Really nice hotel but no option to have a smaller breakfast so I had to pay over 25 for a bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee Maybe if an alternative choice was offered for a continental breakfast at a cheaper price would be an idea I am staying at the hotel again next week and will not be having breakfast there because of the price ,No Positive
502622,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Incredible staff and extraordinarily nice rooms for great value Service was great and we received a free room upgrade upon arrival and early check in 
502623,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, At 20 euros each the breakfast price is pretty steep As we weren t convinced we could eat 20 Euros of breakfast we went outside plenty of good cafes , About ten mins from the museum area and about 20 mins walk from the main town Comfortable hotel 
502624,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, A long walk from the centre Breakfast wasn t the best but was fine kept running out of plates cutlery and some food options , Right opposite a bus and river boat stop Clean and modern
502625,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Room in basement safety issue in case of fire non sprinkler building Housekeeping was horrible carpet in elevator and hallway floors dirty and not vacuumed during 3 day stay Expensive hotel for poor quality , The best part of the stay was Staff were very friendly and courteous Housekeeping poor at best 
502626,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Beds too soft , Just spent the last 3 nights at this hotel loved it Just a short tram ride outside the main centre of Amsterdam on a direct tram line number 4 from Amsterdam s Central Station The number 4 tram stops right outside the hotel We had an early flight so got to the hotel about 10am not being able to officially check in until 3pm However John on reception checked us in took our luggage until our rooms were ready It was my wife s 30th birthday so they upgraded us to a canal view room said that they would put our room on a priority to get in early would call us if this was possible When we got into our room we had 2 complimentary bottles of prosecco as a birthday treat The room was spacious bathrobes slippers in the wardrobe a mini bar The bathroom was modern however the frosted glass door didn t have a proper closing mechanism which was slightly odd The beds are very soft with a memory foam topper brilliant if you like that but way too soft for me Room service menu which is as extensive not overly priced neither was the bar prices The staff were very helpful offered advice on where to go happy to make bookings for trips restaurant reservations Check in at 3pm check out at 12pm but staff happy to keep hold of your luggage if you have early late flights The hotel does reserve 100 on your credit card until check out so be prepared for this on arrival 
502627,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, We booked for breakfast 1 morning and thought it was a little on the expensive side for what you got , This hotel was so lovely Staff were very friendly with an excellent location for the tram Loved every minute 
502628,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, April 2016 Our room on the ground floor overlooked a scruffy garden courtyard Room was basic to say the least although perfectly clean It was noisy as next to reception and the bar We had arrived after a long haul flight and were shattered We were told by the male receptionist that booking a taxi to the airport for the following morning would cost a pre agreed 29 Euros which turned out to be completely untru we were charged 46 Euros and the driver was extremely rude saying that it could never cost just 29 Euros to the airport , The location and staff 
502629,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, I got woke up 1 night with banging The next morning I could see this was due to a room next to my room Not sure if it was washing machine s or some sort of machinery This only happened 1 night though and I got back to sleep fine , The bed was really comfy The staff were great This had been booked for my partner s 21st and the staff left rose petals in the room with 2 small bottles of prosecco and a card wishing her happy birthday Great touch and this started the holiday off well The hotel is in a good location From the centre when you get off the train you can then get a tram It s 5 or 6 stops on the tram to the hotel and no more than 10 minutes 
502630,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The bathroom looked very nice however the door was partially transparent Thus it felt like there was no privacy in the bathroom which was a bit weird , The room looked very stylish with a comfortable bed and a nice bathroom with a rain shower The hotel is close to De Pijp which is full of hip cafes and restaurants and it is in walking distance to all the tourist attractions 
502631,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Room was really comfortable and the staff were efficient and friendly Location of tramstop outside hotel was very convenient Didn t pay extra to have breakfast at hotel so cannot comment on the food 
502632,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, we were welcomed and all facilities were good we did not have the breakfast or any other meals The convenience was perfect and would defiantly choose a room with a view of the canal this time there were 3 of us and had to go into the souterrain 
502633,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, We didn t know that a City Tax of 5 would be added and that the room rate increased daily Also the lift and carpets needed to be vacuumed when we arrived and still needed vacuuming when we left This gives the impression that the hotel is shabby , The staff were friendly and helpful The breakfast was delicious and waitress a joy 
502634,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Everything was great about this hotel the staff were very accommodating and the hotel itself was of a very high standard I will definitely stay here next time I m in Amsterdam I was upgraded for free to a room with a canal view 
502635,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Staff were very helpful friendly and efficient Beds were extremely comfortable and three pillows each was perfect and appreciated Coffee machine was a lovely extra
502636,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The money you pay to stay there you should at least get your breakfast for free I think 23 for a breakfast is a little bit to high unless you get a plate full of magic shroom , Hotel very nice Rooms very nice Staff very nice
502637,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Windows too high , The bed was so comfy Huge shower room and plenty of light sources in the room and in the bathroom Really good electronic switches to turn the lights on and off from your bedside Lovely wardrobe and desk space Lovely and clean Great bathroom products and restocked daily Excellent cleaning staff Helpful polite and friendly reception staff Bar staff very polite Secure entrance through using your key card Excellent resources eg Use of bikes Really stylish interior Two free drinks vouchers in our room 
502638,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Room cleaning is done relatively superficial Also in common areas elevator for example for 5 days as it was not given a vacuum cleaner ever It is one of the first impressions that you make it For hotel claims it is not too good , The bed extra confy
502639,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, That I didn t stay long enough, The bed was extremely comfy had the best nights sleep on it Food was excellent location is very ideal Can t wait to return
502640,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Parking space of the hotel is expensive although it is still cheaper then city parking It should be cheaper for hotel customers Breakfast is also additional cost Some rooms in the basement floor do not have windows You should check prior to your visit If you want to change with upper floor room but it will be also charged additionally , The location of the hotel is great There is a station in front and you can take the tram every 10 minutes If you want to walk Rembrandtplein is really close and also the center itself is not far Rooms are modern nice and comfortable The pillows were a little bit high but when we asked for slimmer ones they brought in 5 minutes 
502641,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, If I really have to be picky then couple of small things in the room needed replacing but it was nothing , Location of this hotel is excellent very close to big museums and Dam square Tram no 4 stops right in front of the hotel so easy commute Room was fairly clean and staff were friendly 
502642,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Great location 10 15 minutes walk from Museum quarter Heineken experience and a couple of the canal tour companies Pretty much everything else was within a reasonable 30 35 min walk for us and of course it s all flat Staff courteous and friendly our attic room was large quiet and comfortable Used the restaurant a couple of times as it was exceptionally cold in the evenings during our stay Food was great and a similar price to other restaurants we ate in 
502643,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, I booked this hotel based upon the reviews I use Booking com because I love the customer based rating system and rarely have a bad experience I booked two rooms over a month in advance Initially we were five 3 weeks before the trip we were four so I changed the reservation Cancellation without penalty was possible until 2 days before the reservation The price remained the same so upon check in I asked them to please adjust the price as we were only 4 and I made the change 3 weeks ago I was told if I had made the reservation through the hotel he would be able to change it without a problem Since it was through booking com it was up to booking com and they would have to telephone them During check out I asked about this She said there were no notes in the system regarding this She claimed they would lose part of the commission if they changed the price 100 She also claimed that her colleague at the next desk had just accidentally deleted a note regarding the commission on our account I telephoned Booking com on my telephone and was told the commission isn t considered with a change only a cancellation The Booking com representative said the decision was completely up to the hotel and asked to speak to the hotel representative I heard the hotel representative say they booked a triple room they must pay for a triple room The hotel representative told me that Booking com didn t send them a notification I made an early check in request through the same Booking com system Notting Hill quickly responded with their check in and check out times and offer to hold our luggage If we had arrived with only 4 and wanted to change it upon arrival I completely understand However I made the change 3 weeks in advance This is rare so I was quite happy Usually things happen last minute and you are stuck with the charge This is where I feel Notting Hill completely failed Booking , The hotel is nice and well maintained The rooms were very clean and the beds were comfortable The location is convenient The pillows are a bit large We purchased a soda from the mini bar it s like a vending machine There was a strange taste it had expired the month before 
502644,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The electricity went the morning I had to check out not the hotels fault of course which caused the breakfast not to be a breakfast and using the bathroom in the dark The room was lovely and very comfortable but it was either the aircon or other people flushing loos as it was very loud , Great location lovely rooms great staff would definitely stay again 
502645,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, No problems worth mentioning , Staff very friendly and helpful Great location handy for museums trams and canal cruises Nice hotel Would definitely return and recommend 
502646,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The hotel took a 100 deposit from my account without any warning when we were told we would pay the full amount on arrival however they did cancel the deposit payment when we checked out The bathroom had a glass door meaning there was not much privacy , Lovely hotel very clean Nice room comfy bed Friendly helpful staff Good location near city centre tram 4 takes you directly to dam square There are lots of shops restaurants near the hotel 
502647,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Not a bath in every room this was needed for baby Friends had one so probably this could have be pre arranged , Very clean modern and staff helpful and friendly Tram 4 straight into city centre and canal tour stop right outside 
502648,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Hotel staff didn t tell us about the tram stop so until the last day we walked quite some distance First room which was basement was very noisy so we were moved second room air con very noisy Receptionist gave us a map showing places to go but no detail on best way of getting there could have been more helpful , Tram stop straight outside hotel 
502649,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Lovely room super comfy bed Room was next to the gym so corridor was noisy from an early time Didn t really have much interaction with staff apart from booking in 
502650,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Upkeep and cleanliness of public areas could have been a bit better though room itself was sufficiently clean , Very friendly staff excellent location quiet room 
502651,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Felt the restaurant menu was limited only offers 4 options for mains plenty of other places to eat in Amsterdam so didn t ruin the trip at all 3pm check in time wasn t ideal we noted on our booking we d arrive at 1200 but they still didn t have a room available they did take our bags etc for us and off we went we d been travelling from 2am so a quick shower would have been nice but I m being picky, Convenient location right opposite the no 4 tram approx 5 stops from central st 
502652,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The only pitfall was the location Although the hotel isn t extremely far from the main square it took us a little while to get used to the trams we needed to take to get there Perhaps some assistance with trams eg very simple maps to take for free would have improved our Amsterdam experience , The staff were brilliant and the hotel itself was lovely very well kept and in great condition 
502653,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Very friendly staff Close walking distance to the Heineken Experience and Rijksmuseum with a tram stop right outside to travel to other areas of the city 
502654,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Bike hire price is a little steep 16 per day not a 24 hour day , Beautiful beautiful little hotel The room we stayed in was perfect and it was one of the cheaper rooms in the basement so I could not believe it when we walked in Very unique but modern very clean Room was even equipped with a Nespresso coffee machine for morning coffee Could not have asked for anything more Tram stop was almost right outside and it was only a few minutes ride into the centre of Amsterdam Hotel have their own bikes you can hire Would definitely return 
502655,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The glass door and open shutter in the bathroom Couldn t be totally private, The bed was the comfiest I ve ever slept on I liked the canal view Shower great 
502656,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The bed mattress could have been more comfortable was lumpy we stayed 5 days and was sore after day 1 sleeping we were down in basement room 808 and it was bit smelly going down the stairs,No Positive
502657,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, No hotel information in room regarding time of breakfast gym opening etc When asked we were told it was available on the TV but could not find Twice rooms were not cleaned when we returned after a day out First we were told preference was given to cleaning rooms of those leaving and preparing for arrivals and not to customers with continuing booking On second occasion we were told bedrooms were not cleaned daily as a matter of course unless requested by guest Never experienced this before Breakfast expensive so used local cafes , Good location Good size room and bathroom Nice comfy bar area
502658,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Lovely modern room John who worked on reception gave us a lovely welcome and made sure our stay was comfortable and went beyond what we expected in terms of customer service
502659,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, No Negatives from us only Thumbs Up , The location was perfect for us close to everything on Tram 4 The staff were excellent always greeting us the room was amazing and so comfortable with gorgeous bathroom No disturbance would highly recommend this Hotel 
502660,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, I had a room under the roof with just a tiny little window up into the sky I think this is not acceptable for Euro 114 which was said to be a special rate Besides this the room was nothing special concerning style so the Boutique attitude was not visible in the room , Nice hotel good location friendly personnel
502661,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Had one of the attic rooms Good size very comfy but just had a skylight which my other half didn t like , Walkable to some good restaurants and easy access to the centre by tram that stops outside Staff were great 
502662,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Prior to travelling 80 was taken from my card as a pending transaction Then on arriving I had to pay the 217 fee and on top of this another 100 Euro s as a deposit All of these requirements were not made aware to me until I arrived Therefore I had to spend an extra 120 which I got back in the end before even staying at this hotel It just made it very expensive and ate into spending money This should be made far clearer to guests before they stay , I really liked the extra touches to this hotel such as the complimentary Nespresso machine the free Heineken toiletries sweets at the lift door It just made it feel very welcoming and attentive to detail 
502663,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, I was expecting a little more from my delux room The location is outside of the centre , John on reception was excellent the dining area was comfortable with good service and the room good No 4 tram stop right outside the hotel 
502664,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Nothing at all for our stay it was perfect , Hotel itself is in prime location just outside all the madness of central Amsterdam Can easily walk anywhere and tram line is outside front door Staff are excellent and very friendly the sweets and chocolates available in reception were always a passing bonus Room was on 4th floor in the attic and was lovely everything was very clean and excellent place to stay for a couple of nights Downstairs bar and restaurant seemed very good although we always are out Loved staying here and would recommend it to anyone seeking a small boutique hotel in Amsterdam because this is exactly what you want 
502665,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Don t bother with the overpriced breakfasts plenty of cafes at a fraction of the price Bathroom door did not have a catch in it so we re unable to actually shut the door let alone lock it Minor details really don t be put off you won t be disappointed , Staff were fantastic and had arranged a bottle of bubbly in the room as per my emailed request Very informative and happy to help made sure we had a room with a view as per my request room 204 Hotel is very nice and right next to main tram route so 3 stops 5 minutes to Rembrandt Square 
502666,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The bar I understand that it s a boutique but with such a well stocked bar it would be nice if the bartender knew the classic cocktail menu and how to prepare cocktails formally I requested a gin martini and had to guide the bartender through the process which was ok Until the next customer requested a white Russian and he too had to provide directions and an ingredient list for his cocktail , I ve stayed in Amsterdam on several occasions and this was one of the best hotel experiences I ve ever had all around I really enjoyed a great arrival escorted to my room with just a carry on I also enjoyed the bed reminded me of the Hilton approach to bedding plush 
502667,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, We asked for early checking through out booking website We received an email saying that it would be possible When we arrived the male receptionist was not accommodating at all He said We never do that And would not work with us at all He should have at least tried to see what could be done if anything he really was the only disappointing thing about our whe stay , Location price the Nespresso machine 
502668,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Early checkin would have helped and If two keys can be issued to couples , Located not far from central amsterdam with a tram number 4 stop in front of the hotel Local market nearby and very quiet Staff very friendly marjolie thanks for checking us in Breakfast was good with alot of options to choose 
502669,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, It would have been perfect if there was a fridge in the room to have your own drinks There was a vending machine but that was not working and I would not have wanted to pay hotel prices a vodka and lemondade in the bar was 9 euros Also all of the light switches are electric which are very pretty blue lights not good if you are light sensitive to sleep as I am I bought a note pad and masking tape in the supermarket the second day and that solved that problem , It was well situated If you get the train to central station you need to get tram numbered 4 and it drops you off right outside There is a supermarket just around the corner which was handy The actual hotel was about 10 mins from Dam Square by train It was very clean and the bed was really comfy The staff were friendly I would stay there again The shower was lovely 
502670,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, the room was a bit narrow but this is due the old building This was compensated for quite well by the decorating and furniture It was a minor point especially when you consider everything else value location quality etc , very cozy elegant ambiance helpful pleasant staff and wonderful value for money 
502671,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Be careful lots of rooms are in the basement they call it maisonette which is correct but still it came as a surprise There s a big ventilation roster and there are some weird noises coming out of there constantly Also the sound isolation is bad you hear what is happening above your head and I woke up at 07 00 because they started hammering I told them and they didn t seem to care much they did offer a cup of coffee The check out was done by a very young and inexperienced clerk who made many mistakes and behaved very nervously it made the check out experience uncomfortable as well , It was very nicely decorated 
502672,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The view from my room but hey that was just the luck of the draw someone had to have a poor view on this occasion it was us, Everything apart from the view from my room
502673,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Staying on floor 1 is not that good The noise coming from staff and the zero view from the window is quite disappointed , Facilities bed and bathroom are excellent 
502674,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, It was very hard to find no proper directions were given online when it s only a simple tram to take and no number of tram given They took 100 out of my account as a pre authorisation and said it would only be put back in after 5 working days Not ideal when you depend on that money to have a weekend in amsterdam,No Positive
502675,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Staff where very helpful room was comfortable and clean lovely comfy bed and shower was great although its said it was a little out we walked everywhere and this allowed us to take in the city 
502676,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Only stayed for one night but the location was good staff were very helpful and welcoming and the rooms were lovely Would definitely stay here again 
502677,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Only thing was that we got a basement room with no view , Staff were excellent and really helpful Beds were really comfortable Food in the restaurant was really good Really nice rooms The hotel is just nicely out the way but only a short walk into the centre 
502678,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, We loved this hotel Perfect location staff were very helpful and our room was gorgeous We would highly recommend this hotel when visiting Amsterdam 
502679,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Room too small Bathroom doormade of normal glass Everybody sees and hear you when you are on the toilet The door of the shower do not completely closed that means water overall , Friendly staff Location in the Center
502680,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, My partner and I had the most amazing stay start to finish The staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a magical Christmas break from a bottle of wine on arrival to a trip to the van gogh museum The hotel itself was beautiful and location was perfect Would stay here over and over again Amazing thank you 
502681,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Lights in room were turned on and off all night from the corridor Definitely a major fault in the design Making it Impossible to sleep Noisy room thin walls Will not return , Location
502682,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Not in walking distance from centre etc had to use the tram to get around However the hotel was amazing and so worth every penny Absolute luxury Couldn t praise the friendly gentleman on the front enough he was lovely the room was amazing and bed so comfy , Amazing friendly staff and beautiful hotel Would definitely recommend for a young couple as we had to use the tram to get to the centre etc Located near the Heineken museum 
502683,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Me and my wife had booked a delux room which was quite a considerable amount of money more than the other couple we came withs room But are room looked no different and had no other perks I thought Still a lovely room tho but maybe throw a breakfast in with the delux or something along those lines , The class of service from the staff was great and made you feel welcome from the word go And the look of the hotel was beautiful Great location too 
502684,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The only thing I feel to comment on was the breakfast buffet There wasn t a great deal of choice for example only scrambled egg and it was 23 50 each and I thought it was too expensive for what you get , The room was very spacious very comfortable bed great shower and staff were very attentive and friendly I also had a special request as it was my girlfriends 21st birthday the hotel organised champagne chocolates and sprinkles on the bed on arrival 
502685,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Mini bar expensive, Hotel fabulous bed was amazing Little extras like dressing gowns and slippers great Location really good and overall great time
502686,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, Really glad we stayed in this hotel Staff were really friendly especially john who checked us in and went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed our birthday celebrations in amsterdam 
502687,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Just maybe a little far out of town but the number four tram takes you right in, The hotel room was very comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful pictures on the site don t do it justice
502688,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Our experience of the hotel was good We thought it would be a little nearer to the centre of Amsterdam when we booked , Hotel excellent in all respects We really liked the style of the hotel Our room was large and very quiet as we asked for 
502689,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Was a little out from the centre but not far atall just further than I expected , The room was lovely clean and modern The staff were really accommodating and helpful listened to my request regarding birthday wine in the room for my partner 
502690,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Cousins in room had stains on and cups and spoons were not cleaned or replaced We were not informed of a 100 deposit that had to be paid which I did not get back at the end of the stay put a downer on the whole trip , Location was good and very friendly staff 
502691,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Nothing, Everything staff hotel food location everything was excellent soooo friendly and accomadating would recommend as the perfect place to stay in amsterdam
502692,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, Location is just okay to city center over priced for what you get We slept below ground at the basement level with windows right out to the street Room was cramped and very noisy I would not book here again OH well, It is a pretty hotel and it is trying to be high end in its presentation and staff accommodation
502693,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, We did have a bad experience while checking in not by the person checking us in but from a rude member of staff called Helen She abruplety came over asking us to turn some music off which we fully understood and did not have a problem with But it was the manor she did it in it felt like she was looking down on us like we shouldn t have been able to stay in the hotel as she stated we are a four star hotel then mumbled she can see who will be trouble , All staff bar one were outstanding rooms beautiful and we even recived a little treat box in New Year s Eve We also ate downstairs which was also very nice Would recommended this hotel to anyone 
502694,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The lift was broken so we had to take the stairs to the 4th floor the staff could not have dealt with this issue any better taking off our bar bill at the end of the stay to compensate it , Great location and the service was excellent the staff went out of their way to ensure we had the best stay possible 
502695,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The basement room had no window except looking up to the street so had to have blind closed the whole time unless you wanted people looking down into your room but i was mainly there just to sleep so it was not so bad , The location is great and very close to the Line 4 tram stop right outside the door
502696,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, We didn t stay long enough , Fantastic hotel in a great location Easy access from a tram right outside the front door although you can walk to most places you need to be Staff were amazing the room and bed were amazing Would definitely stay here again 
502697,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, I stayed in Notting Hill Hotel for 4 nights The room was very small even for solo traveler and it was in need of a good General Cleaning They did not change bed sheets at all those days They didn t charge tissues as well There were 2 bottle of water for free only on third day of my stay Mini bar was consistently out of order during all my stay Breakfast was the poorest I have ever seen it was just supermarket food they don t bother themselves to remove the plastic layers from before putting the sliced cheese on Breakfast Buffet I think the breakfast food news to be fresh , The location of the hotel was good and convenient Wifi access was in good quality If you need a Hotel in the middle of town only for sleeping you can go for it 
502698,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, A small note would have been nice to know that when booked through booking com there is a 100 reservation fee when you get to the hotel , The staff were incredibly polite and personalised our visit They went above and beyond leaving us a bottle of bubbly to celebrate our recent wedding Hotel was modern clean and contemporary 
502699,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, No fridge to store a drink or two was a bit annoying, Liked bed and location Staff were very nice and welcoming at all times Nice end of town and was easy to get around
502700,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, A short bus ride out of the centre of Amsterdam Then little things like most hotels Working out the heating lighting systems Hairdryers holding down the button to keep it working no funnel for directing the heat The toaster at breakfast Why do hotels use these that revolve the bread around the heat and don t toast AND they actually had a screen on the floor showing a fire with flickering flames , Attractive property rooms good Breakfast ok 
502701,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill,No Negative, nice and special boutique hotel the breakfast is very good even you can t order la carte eggs when you booked buffet breakfast you can but it s not included tram station right in the front of the hotel 5minutes with the tram to the dam
502702,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, We had asked for authorisation and payment to be put through in local currency as this gets us a better rate they didn t listen Dinner was awful poor value for money and very greasy Hotel was a little out of the way but if you go right out or the hotel and walk less than 5 mins just after the bagel cafe there is the most amazing cafe bakery It does a bakers breakfast for 11 euro the hotel charged 23 euro Coffee was amazing Won t be rushing back to Notting hill but will def go out of my way to visit this bakery Room was also too small and awful view considering the price paid , Friendly girl on reception and was helpful

502707,Boutique Hotel Notting Hill, The tea and coffee provided in the rooms were not sufficient for purpose For a four star hotel I found the lack of milk and meagre amount of tea and coffee not up to standard Plus the elevator was never vacuumed in the four days we were there , The hotel was quiet and comfortable and close to tram and bus routes so easy for sight seeing It also is on the outer edge of the central area so is just the right distance away from the crowded centre
