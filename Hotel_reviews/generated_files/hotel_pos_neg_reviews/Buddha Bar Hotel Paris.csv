177058,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, I could hear music from the courtyard very early in the morning So sound proof windows would be a nice addition It was great music anyway so it really wasn t a hardship , The staff were extremely helpful and friendly Very professional and courteous as well 
177059,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, The rooms at the annex block is not even a 3 star standard lifts also breaks down was very disappointed when they send me to the annex block instead of the main building they should have inform us earlier regarding the room change Was also disturbed by a few fire drills , Location is the only plus
177060,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, Nothing, The staff were excellent the front desk staff and in particular Kevin was fantastic We moved hotels to this one after a poor experience and as it was our anniversary we had an upgraded room and Kevin sent up a bottle of champagne when we checked in The hotel was very calming and the style and furnishings are lovely We also booked an evening meal at the Buddha bar restaurant which is around the corner to the hotel This was done for us by Kevin 
177061,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris,No Negative, The room was very spacious and nicely arranged to separate business and leisure Friendly personnel extra nice The whole service The personnel was perfect and the room very comfortable 
177062,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, If I have to find something disappointing in the hotel it was the light of the bathroom too dark in my opinion , Everything was excellent From the kindness of the staff till the room Extraordinary service 
177063,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, I didn t like the dark colors of the hotel I know it maybe you he hotels theme but I m not used to it I wish there a bit more lighting , The staff were extremely helpful and friendly I ve never found this amount of help and friendliness in any hotel before Thank you so much
177064,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, The restaurant needs better lighting for during breakfast In the evening the staff was coping as well as expected but they were overwhelmed the night we ate there , The loo in the room is magnificent 
177065,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris,No Negative, We stayed one night in this hotel in December This hotel is quite luxurious our room was really beautifully designed The staff at the hotel were particularly friendly and helpful Definitely a nice getaway 
177066,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, we had a little suite but no breakfast included I think for for a price of nearly 500 EUR per night the breakfast could be included Also there should be a voucher if dinner or brunch is eaten at the Buddha bar restaurant also there was no real SPA area we expected it to be much bigger, the location is great the room is very nice the inner garden is very nice
177067,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, The taxi service used by the hotel The lack of communication between the bar service and the courtyard especially the long wait for tea and cakes desserts in the late afternoon , The hotel is in an excellent location just off the Faubourg St Honore Staff are friendly and helpful There is a good breakfast buffet Rooms are very comfortable and quiet 
177068,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, Hotel and room very dirty Dust is everywhere The bed suddenly stand up in the night Radio switch on automatically every morning at different hours The water of tea always come in cafe caraffe so the tea smells of coffee The Spa was closed and nobody inform us instead we booked 2 treatments Result 2 girls come in the room and one massage bed was broken and after 1 hour come one new bed but that girl dont have enough space to move We leave this poor hotel one night before , Nothing
177069,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris,No Negative, Room was absolutely stunning Big bath and shower heated toilet seat flat screen with bose speakers in the room AND bathroom Staff were so polite and helpful really looked after us A really special hotel 
177070,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, The food was disappointing compared to Buddha Bar Dubai , The staff were fantastic Very fast efficient service The hotel was stunning and housekeeping were excellent 
177071,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, Room not ready upon arrival at 3pm We waited in the bar till 4pm We were overcharged on a glass of wine and no one from reception bothered to bring the room key We eventually picked it up ourselves and had to bring our lugage up ourselves There was still rubish in the room from a previous guest Not what you expect from a 5 star hotel ,No Positive
177072,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, The room was nowhere near a five star accommodation The lights were impossible to work and the electrical sockets worked 20 of the time The bathroom was terribly thought out There was no bath tub and the shower would leak ALL over the bathroom despite my considerable efforts to contain the spray The tap in the sink was about 1 5 inches off the bowl so getting your hands under it was difficult Furthermore the lights in the bathroom were far too dim and seeing your face in the one properly sized mirror of the room was difficult Finally the walls have the sound insulation qualities of cardboard I could loudly hear a phone ringing at 6am everyday from the room next door There was also loud construction and hammering sounds that my wife and I were constantly hearing Sleeping a full night especially with jet lag was totally impossible Also the blinds in the room were ripped and closing them was very difficult and they were very shoddy looking In the event we were to shower twice in one day we had to reuse our towels because there were not enough in the room There were problems and irritations everywhere we turned It was NOT a comfortable experience , The staff was lovely and seemed to show genuine concern for my complaints I very much appreciated them 
177073,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, The beds were a bit hard for my taste and there was music and noise from the inner garden so next time I will prefer a room away from the garden bar , Very nice breakfast friendly staff with a professional distance 
177074,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, wifi was terrible iron marked my shirt as it was very very dirty crowning issue was house music pumping through the hotel at 0530 in the morning very expensive for the quality, very nice hotel in a great location
177075,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris,No Negative, The hotel staff were amazing They gave us a double upgrade upon arrival and were very helpful and accommodating The location of the hotel is excellent right on Saint Honore 
177076,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, Difficult to get something to eat between breakfast finishing and bar opening Shower in our room tended to flow out on to floor Sound regulator on the TV Pay TV means that loud explosions and music in action movies cause the TV sound to cut out so you also miss a lot of dialogue , Fantastic room large airy most of all quiet Everyone says the staff are terrific and it is true they all go out of their way to make your stay as perfect as possible Wonderful front desk staff nothing is a problem for them Wonderful door staff Fast efficient and helpful housekeeping No problem changing doona for sheet and blanket 
177077,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, Very few facilities Staff not helpful at all Coffee machine didn t work Forgot aftershave when checking out and it went missing Expensive for what it is , Excellent location Good sized room Not really much else I can say 
177078,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, Quality of personnel is not up to the otherwise high standard of the hotel Room cleaning though is excellent , Even though breakfast was included in the rrom rate we had to pay in full for breakfast service in the rrom The inclusive is only valid in the breakfast room 
177079,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, Breakfast not included in the rate with booking com yet if I booked directly with the hotel for the same price breakfast was included , Amazing staff and service beautiful hotel Fantastic location 
177080,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris,No Negative, What an amazing stay service was professional friendly and personalized from everyone we met Room was excellent nice simple touches We ate lunch also in the restaurant the burger was to die for Shame we didn t have time for desert 
177081,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, We didn t have over bath shower in our room but it prompted my husband to have a hydro jet bath and he quite enjoyed it The water runs quite slow though , Great location hip boutique hotel the staff goes extra mile to make you feel welcome they even open the bar earlier just for us and our friends and of cause the list of the cocktails are amazingly unique 
177082,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, Having nothing heated in breakfast is weird charging for omelet at breakfast included is weird since it is lousy 9 euro anyhow and having the cleaner coming into the room without knocking the door was very weird and we did not like her shuffling bedding pillows on the top of our shirts nor did we like her reshuffling our stuff in the bathroom counter the way she likes it And they have 6 pillow choices non of which is comfy they are all full and thick which made us lose sleep , The location was excellent The room was good and sizable with tub and shower Reception was polite and helpful 
177083,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, The restaurant was not a highlight contrary to our expectations Equally the spa facilities services are minimal, Location service design ambience and the cocktail bar
177084,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, Poor waterflow from rainshower more like a drizzle than like a tropical shower Luckily the handshower was more powerfull , Warmly decorated spaciious junior suite and bathroom on a central location
177085,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, The shower leaked like a sieve I had to use all of the towels to wipe up the water The sinks spray water all over you the counter in the middle This has resulted in water damage to the lacquered wood it looks tacky now The shower leakage has damaged both doors For the this NEEDS to be rectified , Location staff look of the place The restaurant is good too They charge 44 euros for breakfast It should be included 
177086,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, restaurant excellent food marred by somewhat amateurish service by very young staff after smart head waiter had taken the order , The room beautiful decor quiet and functional nonetheless Reception exceptionally friendly
177087,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, Our rooms had terrible plumbing piping noises during ALL hours Staff were either dumbfounded by our complaint or just ignored it until we spoke to the manager who was actually aware of the problem and moved us only after 2 nights to a different room As compensation we received free breakfast in bed which was a nice gesture but the breakfast always arrived cold even the hot drinks were cold and also appeared on the extras bill and we had to specifically ask to remove it This should not happen at a 5 star hotel you would expect a much higher level of service for the money you pay Mistakes and accidents happen but it was the very poor and incompetent way in which they dealt with the problem that made it clear Talk about level of service there were at least two time in which our rooms were not made up and we were told that we had to ask specifically for that to happen What Also the rooms are generally not quiet if not noisy due to the adjacent courtyard restaurant club no one bothered to mention that beforehand , Excellent location for high fashion shopping and centrally located Rooms are nice and spacious but quite tacky unless you re into purple red and black walls and decor with golden dragons Very fancy toilet Staff was friendly and courteous but not helpful capable enough 
177088,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, The first time i my life i arrived to the hotel and was told that the hotel did not have room i booked i could not believe it No warnings email of phone call simply we are full we have no room for you the room i booked and paid for , Nothing

177090,Buddha Bar Hotel Paris, Shower a bit tight Breakfast variety and layout needs improvement E g single two hole toaster for the buffet breakfast , The staff was friendly The room size was generous The furniture and decor very exclusive
