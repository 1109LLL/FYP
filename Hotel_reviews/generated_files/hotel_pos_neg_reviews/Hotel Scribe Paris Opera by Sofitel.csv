13290,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, Our hotel room was a little small The bath had high sides and was difficult and dangerous to climb in and out for showering Definitely a no go for anyone with mobility issues The separate WC was tiny and a squeeze to get into and close the door A wall telephone was place at hip height so often knocked on in error We didn t receive nightly turn down as expected and raised this with the hotel , Staff were helpful and friendly The location was excellent for getting around Paris on foot or by Taxi 
13291,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, The lobby of hotel is crwodied with so many people and looks like market they should adjust the movement and the ambition of the hotel I booked one night and the management promised me for extend one more night but next day they change their mind for no reason else they should care a bit of room cleaning , The location of the Hotel from opera and shopping places and walking to everywhere is perfect 
13292,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel,No Negative, What a fantastic hotel having stayed in many hotels in paris this one was by far the best With fabulous staff and incredible location you will not be disappointed if you choice to stay here 
13293,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, I was appalled by server who refused me to sit at the dinner one evening stating that i did not nook for donner despite that i told hom i was staying at the hotel It took other servers to give me a table Clearly it was not an issue of space or lack of food it is somply that he did not want me to be served For someone who paid more than 4000 Euro this hotel needs to select its employees as this is a very bad sign,No Positive
13294,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, Free wifi is unacceptably slow And the paying high speed option is more a scam than a service In the year 2017 in a 5 star hotel you re simply supposed to offer high speed wifi for free and calculate the costs in your overall rates A minor but tedious flaw in an otherwise perfect stay , From arrival to leaving it was picture perfect Staff was exceptional with a special mention for customer relations manager Pauline Most dog friendly hotel we ve stayed in The upgrade to our room was the cherry on the cake for a memorable stay at the heart of Paris We will definitely come back 
13295,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, The room we got at the beginning was a first floor corner room which is kind of out of our expectation because we were there for our honeymoon and I booked the room ahead However the staff were very helpful and we did upgrade to a very nice room with a little extra cost , Overall it s perfect Nice location and facility The staff was very nice and helpful Definitely will come back for our next trip in Paris 
13296,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, was quite upset to see trash can in bathroom was not emptied when we checked in , location is great right across from opera garnier a few mins walk to galleries lafayette n rue de saint honore where all the boutiques are located beds were very comfortable n hermes toiletries were good 
13297,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, The wifi connection was not very strong and it was hard to stay connected for longer than 30 or so minutes But it was free so I was able to post to the blog to let people know how I was doing and how my 60th birthday was , The staff made me feel at home in both their hotel and the city of Paris I felt like family 
13298,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, Installation in room very noisy sounds like someone in the room above was vacuum cleaning all night it kept me awake the hallway and elevator is smelly next to my room was a service room where someone was smoking cigarettes in the morning the smell of cigarettes came into my bathroom , Location very friendly staff spacious room bathroom bed is great 
13299,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, We ate in Le Lumiere and were very disappointed It was very casual and really just like eating in a bar The staff did not seem well trained at all The food was nice but very expensive for the type of place where it was served The glasses of champagne were very expensive and the wine list extortionate , Scribe staff in general at reception and the concierge and cleaners were excellent but the Lumiere staff were sloppy and inefficient and did not reflect a 5 star hotel status The Scribe hotel also made a lovely gesture for my husband s birthday with desserts and an upgrade to a beautiful suite which was superb The bed was wonderfully comfortable 
13300,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, The hotel felt a bit outdated The checkin process takes longer than expected The hotel actually checks the Credit Card provided by charging 1 Euro before accepting the booking They said that they usually returns back the euro once the client checks out That s bad At breakfast eggs was charged extra , The bed and the location of the hotel was good 
13301,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, The hotel is starting to look really run down I was really looking forward to staying a plush hotel The ceiling is peeling wall paper peeling the bathrooms are due for renovations , The staff were extremely helpful polite and welcoming and location was perfect 
13302,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, Nothing to complaint about everything was just amazing, Breakfast was splendid I strongly recommend to everybody it is definitely worth the price Location excellent walking distance to Louvre and other monuments if you prefer you can take taxi wherever you want they are at the hotel door all days long Services amazing staff was very friendly especially Guest Relationship Manager Laureen Debrosse very professional customer friendly helpful charming she really helped to make our stay an unforgettable experience Besides they help to to find good restaurants they book them and thanks to this we managed to eat in really very nice French restaurants If you look for a nice place in Paris I advise yo to go to this hotel 
13303,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, No real complaints the only thing if something negative can be said the storage space in the room was somehow limited , The room was excellent with a very large and comfortable bed The bathroom was faultless too as everything in the hotel 
13304,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, I saw a few features that could be refreshed But it is a busy hotel in a busy city so I am sure the maintenance has already be scheduled , The location is perfect You can even walk there from Gare du Nord The lobby bar restaurant is good for business meetings I had a luxury room which was well proportioned by Parisian standards 
13305,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, No cons come to mind , Visited Paris for the weekend with my 13 yr old daughter as she wanted to practice her French I chose the Scribe for it s location and figured with the Sofitel name beside it it would be acceptable We were not disappointed The location was great within walking distance to the things we wanted to do and see The reception upon check in was warm and welcoming And our room was upgraded without asking The room itself was modern spacious for Paris comfortable and had a small balcony overlooking the street The staff was very polite and always helpful especially the Concierge Service team Emmanuelle with whom I had spoken prior to our arrival with inquiries about possible language activities for my daughter was a complete delight She spoke in French with my daughter the whole time gave helpful suggestions of places to visit and even gave her a lovely parting gift a charming book in French We also had dinner at the hotel restaurant Simply delicious As with the other staff members the restaurant staff was helpful polite and very attentive In all it was a lovely albeit short stay and I say merci beaucoup to the staff at the Scribe We will definitely be returning 
13306,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, Toilet outside of the bathroom without a faucet and the small size was uncomfortable Breakfast was expensive , Staff was very pleasant and helpful Beds were extremely comfortable Choice of a tub and a separate shower in the same bathroom was very convenient Location is excellent 
13307,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, It is a bit pricy for winter and the room will be tight for two people, The bed was comfy and I liked the fact that when I came back to the room from an afternoon walk the room was tidied up again 
13308,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, Tiny spaces and corridors mediocre spa and health club The bell boy s and the men who stand by the entrance seem little rude , Their Herm s range of toiletries are surely good The staff at the concierge and the reservation desk are very courteous and helpful 
13309,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, The housekeeping was a bit sloppy as towels and coffee for the coffee machine the used cups and drinking water was not replaced in the night , Rooms were cosy and romantic I will definitely be back here next I am in Paris 
13310,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, My daughters were so spoiled by everybody I had to found good arguments to get them out of the hotel , This hotel is the best one I did in Paris I was travelling with my 2 daughters and they ve been welcome as Princesses Seeing their big smile on their face was Priceless The hotel room was beautiful comfy and quiet Even the breakfast was great with REAL FRESH orange juice I travel a lot I did many hotels in Paris but this one is so great I m sure to go back next time I go to Paris 
13311,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel,No Negative, Location Left my phone at the breakfast table and went out on my last day Halfway when i was out of the hotel i realised i had lost my phone I traced my steps back and the last place was the hotel I called the reception from the room asking if they had found a phone at lost and found but they said no I decided to try again at check out straight after my phone call from the room and the guy at the reception made a phone call to the breakfast room and told me they had found it That made my day Thank you hotel scribe Breakfast was worth it Lots of selection they even had japanese breakfast 
13312,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, The fitness center was limited The bathtub as in a number of hotels is high and can be challenging to get out of Grab bars would help , This hotel has a delightful ambiance From the moment one arrives the staff is catering to your needs The concierge staff was phenomenal The rooms are clean comfortable and well organized The location is ideal 
13313,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, the shower Instead of shower curtain I have seen the half covered by glass type of thing but you cannot shower will full blast without wetting the floor I do not understand why they have this kind of thing Different culture in how to use shower , location new and well decorated
13314,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, Step into the shower is quite high and it would have been nice to be informed prior to arrival that the walk in shower was only available in certain rooms at 40 euros extra per night , Extra comfy beds and levels of service and great location
13315,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, Staff could miss you in the little alcove upstairs in in tea lounge so you had to go back down to get their attention , Staff were welcoming and helpful and the ease of check in was great after a long flight is was nice to be welcomed by a smile and a no fuss attitude The food and wine selection offered was what you would expect of Sofitel a very high standard Thank you Scribe for a wonderful stay
13316,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, We should have stayed longer , The beds were ridiculously comfortable the double glazed windows french doors were brilliant and to be able to get fresh air into a room is always a great thing 
13317,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, very bad welcoming There was a guy at the reception who was very rude They changed our rooms multiple times because of availability On our day of our departure the bellboy forgot one of our suitcases because the hotel was pretty busy we had to miss our train and lose 400 euro for coming back to get it , Location is the only good thing about the hotel As well as Guest Relations manager Pauline Basso Bert Who was really helpful after having trouble with the rest of the reception staff Concierge staff were helpful 
13318,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, Tripe room was only a camp bed so a little cramped in room prob should have known , Excellent location Concierge very helpful booking a fab dinner for us Son poorly so allowed later check out in one of the rooms very accommodating

13321,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, Having to come home, The location was excellent for the four days we were there close to many attractions The staff were very attentive to all our needs didn t want to leave 
13322,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, Very soft pillows when asked for firmer pillows staff brought more soft pillows have found same problem at Sofitel Wentworth in Sydney One lift out of service out of three not enough to move guests quickly out of very small lobby area Great Nespresso machine in room was appreciated but not enough pods or milk housekeeping brought us more but I think it always looks a little penny pinching especially in a 5 star hotel when only just enough is provided for one cup of coffee , Comfortable room Very pleasant polite staff
13323,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, Room a little old fashioned Shower screen inadequate Irrespective of all the positives the nightly room charge is still formidable , Good location close to best shops and within walking distance of most key sites Staff service very good Room spacious by central Paris standard and well equipped king size bed Very convenient for Roissybus service to from CDG 
13324,Hotel Scribe Paris Opera by Sofitel, I had an unpleasant incident in this hotel Some money from my wallet have dissapeared when I left it in the hotel room The hotel s manager considered that is normal for hotel s guests to be stolen I had been left with a bitter taste after this hotel accommodation and of course with the manager s apologies I Recommend to the future guests to take care of their personal things in this hotel ,No Positive
