7743,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, I can t find any faults , This is the third time we stayed at this hotel It is simply great Perfect location and the staff is lovely Definitely recommend it to anyone who is visiting Paris This time I was traveling as family and they gave us a lovely family room on the 7th floor The view was absolutely superb 
7744,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, There were no outlets in the bathroom Police sirens were loud at night but weren t frequent Very quiet otherwise Don t use the elevator if you re claustrophobic We squished 2 adults and a 50 lb child but more as a challenge , Location surpassed expectations Very comfortable bed and pillows Wonderful large window to open almost like a patio which overlooked the cool old neighborhood Wonderful breeze as I laid in bed No screen but no bugs I think we had a tiny glimpse of the Eiffel tower from the window The tiny elevator was actually really fun for my daughter The tub was great The staff were incredibly nice They even helped me to my Uber which wasn t necessary and made sure he was taking me to the right place The proximity to the wonderful Luxembourg Gardens was heavenly 
7745,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Everything was great , The view was amazing The hotel is wonderful and the breakfast was great Already planning our visit back Thank you for the best stay in Paris 
7746,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Bath towels are the size of a face towel For an American Hotel I would have thought that they would have had bath towels fits for the average American I am not American who are rather larger than the average European , Location Good for the RER B for both airports 
7747,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche,No Negative, The hotel was in a brilliant location The staff were very nice and welcoming and the rooms were quite comfortable and cosy Would definitely recommend staying here when visiting Paris 
7748,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Very small thing I m short the side of the tub shower combo was a bit tall to climb over , The staff are extremely friendly helpful There are nice extras in the room like robes with slippers a mini fridge The location is exceptional right in the heart of the Latin Quarter St Germain des Pres neighborhoods Beds were very comfortable the air conditioning worked like a charm 
7749,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Nothing, Location very quiet street but only a stone throw away from bars and restaurants Nice modern room Very clean Friendly and helpful reception staff who all spoke excellent English
7750,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Slightly slow internet , Location was awesome Breakfast was good The rooms are a little small but are much nicer than others I have been in in Paris Lovely lobby area
7751,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, The air conditioner stopped working but the staff were very apologetic and gave us a fan for our room and a complimentary breakfast , The staff were great Very friendly and helpful The hotel is in a great location and our room had a view of the Eiffel Tower Loved it 
7752,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, No mini bar no slippers no toothbrush a bit disappointing for a 4 stars hotel , very well located in between St Michel and Luxembourg Staff was nice and smiling
7753,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche,No Negative, Very convenient and cosy hotel close to some of the nicest places of Paris The view from the room is amazing from Eiffel Tower to Montmartre and Notre Dame The staff is helpful to have a nice stay in Paris 
7754,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, The place could do with a revamp but they don t need to try harder because they have the traffic anyway, Friendly staff excellent location furnishings a bit aged but not below expections 
7755,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, The room was small the elevator was quaintly small and the staff s directions were correct but not always easy to follow For example they would say turn right then go until the street ended then turn right and what you wanted was right there But they wouldn t know the names of the street or tell you that right there meant cross a major street and go 1 or 2 blocks , The location was great and the staff was super friendly and eager to help The breakfast had more items than I expected For example I don t drink caffeinated drinks or coffee and they had a brewed herbal tea To my surprise they had both regular yogurt and Greek yogurt had a machine that squeezed fresh orange juice by the glass and there were other pleasant surprises Also our room was in the old part of the hotel and had a view of the Eiffel Tower That was a totally unexpected treat Although I also listed it in the negatives the elevator in the old part of the hotel was comically small It could barely fit 1 person I don t know how the bellman got our 2 suitcases and 2 rolling carryons into it I imagine he put them in the elevator pressed the floor button and raced it to our floor 4th 
7756,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Nothing , Location was just excellent Staff were very friendly rooms a little on the small side but this is to be expected for Paris really Very very good hotel would definitely stay there if visiting Paris again 
7757,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Not really a restaurant or bar but opposite the hotel there is a fantastic wine bar and there are plenty of restaurants in the area to explore , Fantastic hotel near the Sorbonne on the Paris left bank Close to many restaurants and bars but outside the tourist zone Our room was a decent size and very comfortable The hotel has character but has been refurbished and tastefully decorated Our room faced the street but at night it was quiet There are always refreshments in reception and very friendly staff 
7758,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, The elevator is small , The environment around is great A V lib station is in front of the hotel It takes about 30 minutes to go to Cath drale Norte Dame de Paris by walking There are some Asian style restaurants around the corner for people miss Udon with hot soups 
7759,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche,No Negative, Nice room very quiet in the night the bed was comfortable we particularily liked the bath tub and the small refrigerator The breakfast buffet was good The cold juice and water offered free of charge in the early afternoon was nice My daughter especially liked the PC and the candies in the reception area 
7760,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche,No Negative, The location is very convenient but quiet My husband and I were traveling with our adult daughter and were able to book a connecting room for her She had a completely separate room but we did not have to pay double the price of one room The rooms were large by European standards 
7761,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Elevator could be bigger but that s only because the age of the building We managed ok , Wonderful staffs beautiful breakfast room and foods elegantly displayed and served Gracious hospitality overall Convenient location for public transportation 
7762,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, The housekeeping was a little flaky Face towel disappeared and never returned Milk wasn t topped up Room was small but Parisian hotels usually are Double glazing would be good despite being on 7th floor there was noticeable street noise We had a really good deal on the price I do not know if I would have been so happy paying full price , Excellent location and comfortable hotel Very pleasant staff 5 6 minutes walk to Isle de la Cite and about 6 7 walk to the metro Plenty of nice cafes and restaurants nearby
7763,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, I really don t understand how this hotel has a four star rating My room was very small super dark and it wasn t the cleanest hotel room I saw No drinking water in the room or fridge Staff is not at all friendly or hospitable they asked me to pay the day BEFORE my check out like I was a thief or something similar and I felt very uncomfortable about this I travel for work every week and I have visited hundreds of hotels and honestly this was the first time I felt this way The location is excellent but it is possible to find much better options at the same cost or even cheaper , Just location
7764,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Shower enclosure in bathroom did not prevent the bathroom from flooding each time I took a shower , Asked about a room upgrade with balcony The staff offered a great upgrade for 15 Euros more It had a view of the Eiffel Tower Gorgeous 
7765,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Limited interaction with hotel staff more to do with the position and height of the reception desk relative to the exit , Great location for Pantheon and shopping 
7766,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Breakfast costs 16 euros but is quite limited no fruits and vegetables are not fresh but most people go for breakfast at nearby cafes anyway , Very good location safe and quiet in Latin Quarter can walk or take metro easily to most attractions and RER directly to the airport And late afternoon I can always have a recess at the bueatiful Luxembourg park around the corner Plenty of nice and affordable local and Asian restaurants I like especially Au P re Louis and Sushiyaki I stayed for six nights and came back for dinner every day This area is only a couple of minutes walk off the major tourist zone but already much less noisy and you got better food and service My room is on top floor and the view is awesome one day I saw sunset on Effel tower and it was amazing 
7767,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Room is cleaned a bit late in the day after lunch , Bed comfortable staff very friendly location super Early breakfast in the room is very convenient when you are in a hurry like I was 
7768,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, All great for me thanks , The staff could not have been more obliging I arrived direct from Australia was seriously unwell They are definitely worth more than 5 5 for sevice 
7769,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, No shower door so the bathroom got very wet after showers, Beautiful room quiet location comfortable bed friendly staff particularly the receptionists who helped store the luggage and giving directions when requested
7770,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, We had requested a quiet room The room we had 404 was connected to an adjoining room through locked double doors It meant we could sometimes hear the conversations of its occupants Luckily they were not too noisy people It should not have been allocated to us If they are going to use two rooms for separate parties then they should brick up and soundproof the connecting space , Well decorated and comfortable room with big balcony window We like the location of the hotel very much and have been back a number of times when in Paris 
7771,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Room is small but is normal in Paris Facility is a little bit old but kept clean and everything works , Great location staff was friendly and helpful 
7772,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, We were told we got upgraded on arrival to the Eiffel tower view room wow great In we go into the smallest elevator ever 2people max to the top floor The room was tiny but yes the balcony did have a view of the Eiffel tower for what that was worth What they failed to tell us also was that one of the shower panels was completely missing I mean if we turned on the shower the water had nowhere else to go but all over the bathroom floor Crazy We informed reception and were given a different room which turned out to be twice the size of our upgraded room and we could still see the Eiffel tower from the balcony So much for upgrades, Nice hotel in a great location Next to Luxembourg Gardens and the Pantheon and 5 mins walk to center of Saint Michel The hotel also has lovely little balconies overlooking the rooftops so i recommend you get a room on the top floors 
7773,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Lacking on the fine details some TLC will help but it doesn t bother or hinder the experience at all one just notice those things , Great Location Comfortable small rooms Descent though slightly over priced breakfast 
7774,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, The wifi was quite slow at times It seems to be unusable depending on the time of day when hotel guests were around , My room was a good size for Paris The decor was lovely and very french which was nice
7775,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Size of the double bedroom makes it not too roomy for 2 people The 2 beds were basically set as one king size bed which is not good if you don t want to sleep next to the other person , Beautiful view of the city including side view of the Eiffel Tower Easy access to everything including public transportation and restaurants Nice soft and clean sheets along with soft pillows Clean comfortable bathroom well equipped with toiletries 
7776,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Some Staff could be more friendly and a proper lounge with a bar to relax in would have been nice Bathroom was very jaded and shower over bath had a slippery surface , Good location and comfortable room Room serviced everyday Buses nearly opposite hotel go to the Gare du Nord for the Eurostar Excellent choice of restaurants a short walk away 
7777,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, In the closet was dust I had to clean hangers at first and then put my things, Good location not so far from Notre Dame Cathedral 1 metro station frendly staff beautiful view from room nice area around price quality ratio 
7778,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, A lovely well placed hotel I was however only able to afford it when on offer , Every thing was wonderful The only aspect I would add to the bathroom is a magnifying mirror a great help for shaving and makeup The beds are comfortable and the rooms well appointed though a little snug but one has to remember this is a lovely period building in central Paris The breakfast was excellent and the staff very helpful making eggs fresh to order There was fruit in the lobby together with little cakes and umbrellas The reception staff were most helpful providing maps information restaurant recommendations and reservations 
7779,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, I think the price for Breakfast at 16 euros per day is too expensive but you wont find anything cheaper nearby , Hotel is in a great location with Metro nearby The Luxembourg Gardens are nearby which are lovely to stroll through and are perfect for relaxing in during hot weather The hotel was modern and had a touch of Paris to its interior with staff always haply to help The room was nice and spacious enough for 2 people 
7780,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, In both the rooms we have stayed in it was difficult to take a shower without flooding the entire bathroom , We ve stayed here before and enjoyed it just as much a second time Excellent location near Jardins du Luxembourg Friendly staff Tea and coffee in room is a bonus for Paris 
7781,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche,No Negative, We loved that it was located in a nice quiet neighborhood not in a touristy location So close to public transportation and walking places The staff was always available and friendly Breakfast was tasty and the hostess was so sweet She remembered exactly how we liked our coffee Although the rooms are small ours was perfect We will request a room higher up and with a balcony next time There wasn t one available on this trip 
7782,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Staff rude I had pre paid before we had arrived When we got to the hotel because we didn t have the credit card used we had to pay cash on arrival there was no need for this as the room was already payed for so we had to pay twice Hotel is quite old fashioned not up to 4star standards rooms are very small also bathroom Wouldn t return again ,No Positive
7783,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Could only have the Continental Breakfast in your room Dont understand why Room was pretty compact though comfortable not sure where i would have put the breakfast see above, Nice Parisian feel to the hotel loved the lift which was modern while keeping the old fashioned appeal Very nice reception and guest area great location for exploring the Left Bank Notre Dame and Louvre areas 
7784,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Room claustrophically small Very dark decor Even with all the room lights on it was very difficult to see what you were reading or look at a map Lighting better in bathroom which was were we planned the day out If you put your suitcase at bottom of bed there was no floor walking space Handles on chest of drawers came off everytime you opened one Safe wouldn t program right so didn t use it Skimpy small hard towels in bathroom Hotel further out than it appeared on maps to main tourist attractions On line photos made hotel look modern luxurious and large It s a very small lobby and maximum 2 suitcases and 2 people in elevator Hated stepping off elevator into darkened hallway This was due to economy lighting and dark wood and dark colours on walls A few steps brought the hallway lights on and in general place was quaint couldn t imagine coping with kids in such small twin room We d requested separate twin beds but basically got a divided bed with one headboard We made do but was not ideal for two separate adults to use Was ok for purpose used but not one I would recommend to others , Staff very friendly and will g to assist in either English or French Nice clean bathroom Large tub OK water pressure 
7785,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, The Bathroom could be better designed , Good Price Great Location Good side view of Eiffel tower Very Good comparing to my other hotels booked in Paris which usually have very small rooms 
7786,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Only thing I can complain about was that the batteries were dead in the Remote , Nicest bed i ve slept in in Paris in a long time ALso very quiet even though it was on a busy street
7787,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Room Service was overly expensive More than nice fine dining and when we tried to book airport shuttle times were not convenient , Very close to major sites and great cafes Quiet at night as well being in the location that it is in 
7788,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche,No Negative, Me and my husband stayed for three nights and felt so happy with this hotel The location is only 10 minutes walking from Luxembourg RER Station and also surrounded by fancy stores mini market and some interesting places e g Palais du Luxembourg and Odeon Theatre The room itself was a bit small but very clean and comfortable The best thing about the room was the view We asked to have a best view room when we checked in and the staff gave us a room on the 6th floor with stunning view of Eiffel Tower don t worry be happy they have an elevator Another good thing about this hotel was its short distance to a good Indonesian restaurant named Indonesia Really worth a try please google the location for details 
7789,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, The ceiling in the room was leaking water in two spots in the toilet and beside the air conditioning The cleaning service threw away a hair conditioning of ours and the hotel did not have one to replace it Also there were many bags of garbage from the cleaning service blocking the lift s door and in the middle of the corridor Not very pleasant at all In the Eve s overnight the card did not open the reception door and we got stuck outside the hotel for 10 minutes at a negative temperature until someone opened the door , Very good location 
7790,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Very very small rooms Central heating had air in it and clicked all night What anoyed me was at check out I told the staff and in typical French maner the girl could not care less Not even a cursory sorry Nothing Strange for a US owned business , Small old style hotel

7793,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, On the first day we arrived internet was really good but for the other days I cannot say that it was fast Also hair dryer isnt good if you have thin hair that dries slowly as mine you have to bring your own , Even everyone who travelled paris before said that hotel rooms are really small it wasn t that much Our room was more bigger than we thought The location is excellent near to RER b station Luxembourg also a transfer station like Odeon and Cluny Just walking distance to Pantheon Luxembourg gardens etc In addition near to a big market Monoprix 
7794,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, , I stayed for 4 days on the end of November Staff was nice Room was clean and good as i asked for a window with good air because i have severe dust allergy and i m very impressed The breakfast by room service was good and on time Bus stop and subway aren t far from accommodation It s valuable to stay in Paris If i came back which I will i ll stay in this accommodation again 
7795,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, The room was too small for the price the heat didn t work we had a heater to keep us warm no slippers for a 4star hotel , Close to Notre Dame staff was nice the hotel was looking good
7796,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Decaf espresso is not available for breakfasr, I was staying for 3 nights and the room was really too small They changed me to a larger room without any problem

7799,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche,No Negative, Hotel was spotless Breakfast was fab something to suit everyone Staff were extremely friendly and helpful Hotel is excellently located next to the metro
7800,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, The shower should have had a bigger glass partition to keep water from getting on the floor We had trouble getting clean face cloths every day , We had a beautiful room with a balcony that had a view of the Eiffel Tower We were very impressed with the d cor of the hotel which is quite charming The location was great just 4 blocks from Notre Dame 
7801,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, The bathroom was outdated and dirty with mouldy tiles dirt around the toilet parts and peeling and cracked paint bodged tiles The bedroom was lovely but extremely dusty I had to use wet wipes to dust the bed head etc as I have a dust allergy and was kept awake the first night coughing In the day light I realised why , Location excellent and the design and furnishings were very good 
7802,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Room very small dark and rather claustrophobic Bed at an angle to fit it in the tiny room Bed pretty small too Room was hot and although window opened it faced on to back of building with all the noisy air conditioning and heating boilers , Great location friendly and helpful staff good discount on full room rate making it reasonable value for money breakfast provided free when we checked in also improving value Selection of juice water cakes and sweets available free to guests in afternoon 
7803,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Room was a little small but that wasn t really a problem you trade that for the great location anyday , Location was superb Staff were really friendly and even humored my bumbling schoolboy French Room not that big but clean and nice decor The nearby Cafe Luxembourg is a classic French experience 
7804,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, I wanted to give another guarantee card than the one I had prepaid with and the guy at the desk was new and demanded that I repay my booking with the new card Which I did and they reimbursed me on the initial card but I suffered a foreign exchange supplementary cost of 15 , I had forgotten my passport in the room safe and they were quite efficient to recover it
7805,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Small rooms Smelly corridors No soundproof Fake pictures on the offer There are superior classic rooms and superior delux classic are actually former rooms of the servants with separate staircase etc etc, Location
7806,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, The lift I don t think I d want more than two people at a time or one plus one case Personally I wasn t prepared to chance it so I walked up and down the four flights of stairs Every time Bed not very comfy Ordering room service time consuming and only after doing so and having to wait 45minutes for order did we realise it was outsourced and not done by hotel , Breakfast room ladies were delightful friendly Breakfast was pretty good Clean and tidy with complimentary toiletries in bathroom 
7807,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche,No Negative, We liked everything great location close to all quiet and over all we all enjoyed our stay What l liked as well was the adjoining room as we had 2 children I would recommend the hotel to all 
7808,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Rooms are very outdated old furniture nasty bathrooms which need a complete overhaul lighting extremely poor Rooms small by U S standards Hotel rating too high for such poor quality and facilities , Staff was very superb Breakfast was excellent Location extremely close to fantastic attractions of Paris Excellent eateries nearby 
7809,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Air conditioning was quite poor at 25 degrees it was way too cold We preferred to open the window but it s not always an option dust noise Lightning might be better bed lights high above the bed and no ceiling lamp and lightning above the mirrow in the bathroom for doing make up , Comfortable room bed and bathroom spacious wardrobe room robes and slippers friendly and helpful staff excellent breakfast Location is perfect as well 
7810,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Rooms were a bit small but it s Paris so this was expected , Good location to explore the city and St Germain We were only in Paris for one night but would have been comfortable to stay here for more 
7811,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, yes it is paris style but the room and the elevator seem really too small , I do really love the balcony we spent many days here and every morning when I wake up the balcony made me a very happy morning The location is also great for women there are many nice food restaurants and nice shops you do not need to worry that nothing to do in the evening because near the hotel there are also many nice bar with good view Just 5 minutes walk to Luxembourg park is also great

7816,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche,No Negative, The location is really the best There are lots of places to eat and close to the metro as well You re a 10 15 minute walk away from the Notre Dame as well Our room was lovely Comfy beds and enough space for 2 girls with way more luggage than necessary We also had a view of the Eiffel Tower which was a super surprise when we looked out of the window Perfect 
7817,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, The receptionist was impersonal eg asked me if i liked Paris but couldnt care less about my answer poor qulity toilet paper terrible quality long life milk in rooms dark rooms with deep red decor gloomy , Location receptionist ordered taxi for us
7818,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, The bathroom was very small and the lift was slow and small The room while not huge was ok for Paris , Property was in a good location away from the main tourist attractions It was in a decent condition feels like it could do with an upgrade soon though Staff were helpful and Internet connection was good 
7819,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, The breakfast was too widely spread it took a while to realise how much choice there was, We have been coming to this little hotel for some time now and are pleasantly surprised at the improvements over the years We loved the fresh orange juice machine

7822,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Narrow hallways and staircases tiny elevator and you still have to go up and down a half flight of stairs This was okay for us but those with mobility issues or a lot of heavy luggage might have problems , Decent self serve breakfast buffet rooms were well appointed and by Parisian standards spacious Convenient location to walking and public transit 10 RER B lots of bus lines 
7823,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Tables were not cleaned up and the buffet was not replenished Staff totally indifferent Had to ask several times for items like bread yogurts Very small elevator hardly enough for two Certainly not enough room for a suitcase , Good breakfast quality Small room but comfortable On the fifth floor quiet 
7824,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, I was really unhappy when there where no tables ready for breakfast Staff was hiding in a kitchen and did not clean tables and did not prepare tables for new guests I start to prepare table myself as there were nobody to ask for help Lady in charge appears in fey minutes and start to follow her duties Next time I will avoid to have breakfast in this hotel ,No Positive

7826,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Very thin wall If someone who cannot pay attention to the neighborhood unfortunately stays in the next to your room that s too bad I tried to be patient but I finally knocked the wall at 2 AM in the midnight in order to stop happy laughing British English conversation I could not use the air conditioner because I found a lot of black mold in it then I did not feel good , Very kind staff Easy to access to the station The location is a little bit far from downtown that makes more comfortable 
7827,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Very small lift The room was small for 3 people but adequate via European standards , Loved the location Very close to the University of Sorbonne College like feel and great shopping around the corner Palace of Luxembourg within short walking distance Staff was very nice and knowledgeable 
7828,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, I had a room on the top floor which actually gave me a rooftop view of Paris Unfortunately it was like being in an attic the sloped roof took up half of the small room It was difficult to navigate around the very hard bed to get to the wardrobe and I had to stand on a chair to use the safe It was also extremely hot even with the air conditioner running all of the time The windows did open but with no screens there were issues with mosquitos and birds flying in I didn t change my room because I didn t spend much time in it , The location is wonderful if you like to spend time in the Latin Quarter which I do Great restaurants in the area close to Notre Dame Cathedral plenty of RER Metro stops in case you don t want to walk or would like to get over to the Eiffel Tower or Champs Elysee I am on my first around the globe trip which means I ve been on the road for while so the laundromat right on the next block also gave me the opportunity to run a load of laundry for 6 Euros rather than the ridiculous fee a hotel would charge 
7829,Hotel Trianon Rive Gauche, Breakfast could be a little better Limited choice , Hotel s location is the best thing Top floor city view is breathtaking on a good sunny day Near to 2 train stations Luxembourg Gardens 10 min walk Latin quarter eateries 15 mins walk Notre Dom 15 min walk
