219232,citizenM London Shoreditch, Can t think of anything , Clever use of space and excellent public space Feels more like a comfy stylish house than a stuffy hotel Staff were brilliant Love the concept

219237,citizenM London Shoreditch, Only one problem when I was leaving in the morning I waited nearly 10 minutes for a lift Every time one appeared it was full with cleaners and laundry trolleys etc and those of us waiting to go up to our rooms could not get in This made me late for my morning meeting and it was pretty frustrating However it was one small complaint amongst many wonderful things , Gorgeous hotel amazing staff good value for London wonderful bed fabulous breakfast 
219238,citizenM London Shoreditch, I thought the hot food in offer in the cafe wasn t very appealing and it would ve been nice to be able to open a window in the room , Loved the location and the ease of it all The iPad controls were great loved the selection of free films and having the easy access food and bar downstairs was ideal 
219239,citizenM London Shoreditch, It is bit small like a box room , Everything ultra modern where you could control lights tv movies curtains via ipad And the bed is comfy Very clean Luxury shower and also free movies 
219240,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, Contemporary design and smart rooms I loved this futuristic hotel Minimalist rooms without extra space but with all bells and whistles are entirely controlled with an i pad You can even decide how you want your room to feel selecting the mood from the i pad I found extremely interesting the list of all the alternative attractions and restaurants recommended by other guests that you can find scrolling on the i pad The position is ideal to visit the city and to have a great nightlife Shoreditch is particularly recommended to young people it has been subject to considerable gentrification in the past years with accompanying rises in interesting restaurants and bars try Cream for breakfast two minute walk from the hotel 
219241,citizenM London Shoreditch, Nothing everything was awsome , Very easy and simple check in out staff very helpful and seem to enjoy being there Love the European plug in the room and free water the whole room concept was very nice Breakfast was enjoyable with varied options including vegetarian Just loved my stay l
219242,citizenM London Shoreditch, Nothing Although the bed is just so comfortable you don t want to get out so you miss time sight seeing , What a great place to stay Very friendly staff al willing to help immediately The room is small but everyting is there a shower and toilet unit in the middle of the room with a small sink in the room for washing your hands or tapping a glass of water The shower is a large rainshower with loads of nice warm water The bed ah the bed One of the most comfortable I have ever slept in Fluffy piklows a wonderful cover a nice mattres a great night sleep And the room is so well sound proof I didn t notice until the next morning I was sleeping above a train track when I looked out of the window No sounds from outside came into the room And all the small stories on all the products so much fun 
219243,citizenM London Shoreditch, We had a technical problem with our movies but they more than made up for that Could happen to any iPad , Service and hospitality is excellent the king size bed is super cozy views are cool in the heart of shoreditch nice patio to enjoy a glass of wine with views of old school Shoreditch graffiti and train cars The breakfast spread is too notch definitely recommend purchasing ahead of time To top it all off we were on honeymoon and they sweetly handwrote a congrats letter to us that included a coupon for two premium cocktails Super awesome friendly staff 
219244,citizenM London Shoreditch, No Kettle or tea coffee in your room but there s plenty to choose downstairs , Brilliant large comfy bed great lighting media in the room Friendly staff great location cool place to stay 
219245,citizenM London Shoreditch, Stayed there for a few times different floors and rooms but for some reason this last time I was given a room for a disabled person No big deal but it could have been better in terms of cleanliness and I prefer the other rooms , In general a very nice place to stay at Shoreditch Very nice friendly and helpful staff I d risk to say that everything works well at CitizenM 
219246,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, Had never stayed at a Citizen M hotel before and though very contemporary and certainly different to Hilton it was nonetheless very refreshing with a good outdoor space to watch the world and drink wine or coffee The best thing about the hotel was the staff extremely friendly and helpful and plentiful Such nice people Also our room despite being opposite the lift always a worry was ultra quiet We never heard anyone above or next door so superior was the sound proofing I know the room is full of the huge bed but my gosh it was comfy One of the best hotel beds I have slept on Possibly not for everyone but we loved it and we wil definitely stay again A converted Citizen 
219247,citizenM London Shoreditch, The toilet wasn t cleaned well , I love the concept interior and how it is the same in every hotel like coming home a bit The rooms are practically designed light and the ipad that remotes all the functionalities in the room is an add on The location is superb 
219248,citizenM London Shoreditch, Would have liked tea making facilities in the room but understand that people like me are in the minority , This hotel has absolutely got it Black out blinds soundproof rooms fluffy towels huge comfy bed whisper quiet AC all the ingredients for a good night s sleep No concierge no reception but friendly helpful staff on hand Great breakfast and area to relax or work marvelous 
219249,citizenM London Shoreditch, Room cleaning inconsistent Both room and bathroom bin not emptied on 2 days of 4 day stay No waters one day in fridge Soap dispenser at sink not replenished until 3rd day , Location
219250,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, This is an amazing hotel if you are into something a little different It reminds me of something you d find in Japan Small rooms but they are super smart and for us who had 3 large suitcases and golf clubs we made it work We love shoreditch area for food and really easy access to the trains Staff were really friendly We stayed for 5 nights and it was great The bar is open 24hrs Just be aware the rooms are small 
219251,citizenM London Shoreditch, It is impossible to turn off the aircon in the room This is a problem if you don t like the noise I find it hard to sleep or you just don t like Aircon ,No Positive
219252,citizenM London Shoreditch, I stayed at Bankside and you got lots of different drinks and snacks in the fridge At the Shoreditch Hotel you only get water so it was a bit disappointing , Great big bed that was really comfortable Everything you need in the room
219253,citizenM London Shoreditch, Tea coffee making facilities should have been available in room Very expensive did not like the surge pricing, The view from our room of London Staff friendly 
219254,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, Great location in the middle of Shoreditch near the overground station and several bus stops Beautifully designed rooms with comfortable large beds Free movies on demand and free water bottles Great shower facilities 
219255,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, We booked fora night on the 16th June The hotel was fabulous Check in was a breeze self check in but members of staff around to greet you and help you The hotel is bright airy and really funky We were able to choose what floor level we wanted to be on so chose 8th floor The rooms are well laid out with everything that you could need for a couple of nights stay 
219256,citizenM London Shoreditch, If I had to choose one thing that wasn t utterly amazing If we had been there for more than one night then I think tea coffee making facilities in the rooms would have been good , Amazing beds funky decor helpful friendly staff everything was brilliant 
219257,citizenM London Shoreditch, High fan sound in the room that destroyed my sleep Did not at all fancy the over complicated digital world of this hotel Not my type of stay Will not use again Breakfast was not at all worth the price Ordinary Prefer service and no iPad system in a room The hotel was plastic fantastic and Un personal , Interesting concept 
219258,citizenM London Shoreditch, Unfortunately the fire alarm went off at 1 30am However we were back inside after 20 minutes thankfully , The bed was really comfy and big The on demand TV content was brilliant 
219259,citizenM London Shoreditch, This is not up to the same standard as the CitizenM on Bankside feels like a budget option in comparison and left me feeling rather underwhelmed and disappointed ,No Positive
219260,citizenM London Shoreditch, The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night Due to the position of the bed you need to climb over one another whenever you need to get up at night , Very comfortable bed Great shower 
219261,citizenM London Shoreditch, The iPad remote didn t work all of the time There was a bit of a strange smell when entering the room , I quite enjoyed the shower The free movie selection was great The adjustable mood lighting was interesting Great view Staff was friendly and accommodating 
219262,citizenM London Shoreditch, The tightness of the bathroom space but that s just being picky, Liked the gadgets the movies the big japanese style bed the mood lighting the ease of the check in
219263,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, The bed is amazing it takes up most of the compact room Close to everything and great for being in the heart of east London Love the ipad controlled rooms with new release movies on demand Bar and common areas were amazing as well 
219264,citizenM London Shoreditch, Not much really , Big comfy bed and free updated movies Everything is all sleek and modern and fits the trendy vibe of east london The location is a nice alternative from central london lots of good restaurants around and brick lane is about 10 min away 
219265,citizenM London Shoreditch, The card system for the lifts doesn t work well and that s in all CitizenMs , It s a great concept of a hotel if you don t mind small rooms but a big bed and a very homely feeling lobby 
219266,citizenM London Shoreditch, The lack of tea or coffee making facilities was frustrating resented having to go down and purchase two at the bar on the first floor Whilst the A M P M choice of shower gel was very unique and novel a hair conditioner would have been more useful The iPad control is a nice touch but we spent more time trying to figure out how to simply switch off the lights than needed , A lovely modern property with a super cool and comfortably designed reception bar lounge area The parking was easy but not cheap at the nearby NCP on Gt Eastern St Loved the self check in and out the bed was exceptionally comfortable and room really quiet Stones throw from the hustle and bustle of Shoreditch Brick Lane etc 
219267,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, Great helpful staff fab location had a great break with my seventeen year old daughter couldn t have asked for better Rooms a little cramped but that is London Innit 
219268,citizenM London Shoreditch, My tablet had no battery so it took a while to work out how to get everything working in the room , Great breakfast thank you Lots to choose from and really yummy 
219269,citizenM London Shoreditch, There were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room and the iPad which controls everything in the room was not charged when we arrived Fridge was handy but expected more freebies than a bottle of water , The bed was HUGE Really nice room larger than I was expecting and the iPad control for everything from the blinds to the tv was excellent Free movies 
219270,citizenM London Shoreditch, The room was tiny well laid out for fitting everything in but basically you could hop on the bed or into the bathroom pod and that s about it It wasn t cleaned properly and you couldn t open the door to the bathroom pod without it hitting the toilet and making a massive clang The iPad set up for the room was cool but it ran out of battery as we didn t put it back on the charger correctly our fault I know but it s a huge design flaw if the iPad is dead you can t do anything , We got a last minute deal so the price was discounted and I would say I was happy to pay that however the price I have seen quoted for the same room at other times seems way over the top It s in a fantastic location if you like Shoreditch I used to live there so I know the area well but you don t have to know the area to just walk out the hotel and enjoy it Some of the design features were fun maybe a little over the top for my taste at times 
219271,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, Modern hotel and room nice structure close to Shoreditch overground and 10 minutes walk from Liverpool street Fast check in checkout probably one of the best hotel in the area for the price 
219272,citizenM London Shoreditch, Couldn t get TV channels to work but found a remote under the bed just as I was checking out Good quality shower but water pressure a little low so smaller shower heads would in fact have been better ,No Positive
219273,citizenM London Shoreditch, The rooms are insanely small and the photos dont do it justice The rooms might be ok for a single traveler but do not come here if you re traveling with someone else Also the hotel is too modern for its own good Controlling the tv with an ipad is just annoying , Location and ease of check in 
219274,citizenM London Shoreditch, I m not always so keen on self service check ins but there was still a friendly member of staff to help us with it The whole process was pretty quick The room was a little small but the overall feel and iPad controls made up for this so don t have much to moan about really , The hotel looked new everything was well maintained They went to an extra special effort for my partners birthday which was really appreciated The bed was a very decent size considering the size of the room We also had a great view over east London The iPad controls in the room felt special and exciting with great mood control lighting and easy access to TV and music 
219275,citizenM London Shoreditch, It took a long time to get hot water in the shower and tap but maybe that was because I was on the 5th floor I had to run it for a good few minutes which is a big waste of water, The staff were friendly and very helpful It had a fun vibrant atmosphere and it felt very efficient
219276,citizenM London Shoreditch, Rooms are small Breakfast is rather pricey with not that much choice for me there was lack of vegetables , Cozy modern cool place with cool digitalized rooms in cool area Friendly staff thr hotel is all about fun in every detail 
219277,citizenM London Shoreditch, It is fairly expensive but I guess for London probably not bad Worth it for the quirkiness though , Really fashion conscious quirky modern hotel Excellent rooms comfy bed and a lot of fun Arrived with bikes and were taken to the basement secure bike store which was a bonus 
219278,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, Spotlessly clean friendly staff room is small but designed to have everything you need next to train line but soundproofed so very quiet Lounge nice and breakfast expensive but nice 
219279,citizenM London Shoreditch, The aircon was a little noisy at night , The room is simple but well designed though i think as a couple for a base for a longer stay in London it may get a little cramped it was perfect for a one night business stay The bed was extremely comfy 
219280,citizenM London Shoreditch, I wouldn t come with anyone else there s an open style bathroom basin is part of the room which is fine on your own but a bit too intimate for sharing The room is very small which again is fine for a night or two but for a longer stay I d get cabin fever The citizen theme is cute and it s a clever way to excuse themselves from providing tea and coffee etc in the room there s a communal lounge downstairs I like the hotel s atmosphere but they ll need to watch it or the place might feel dated before long, This is perfect for a solo one night stay It feels futuristic like a space pod everything controlled by an iPad mini interface The novelty of it all is entertaining Good wifi and a comfy bed that takes up half the room 
219281,citizenM London Shoreditch, The location was off putting for me I ve stayed in Tower Bridge one before There was more TV channels available that time , Very efficient space management in the room Never felt claustrophobic Bed is so comfortable 
219282,citizenM London Shoreditch, I think it could do with a room update the room is starting to look tired Value for money is debatable for a cubicle like room , Standard Citizen M hotel next to all Shoreditch sights and walking distance from Liverpool Street Station 
219283,citizenM London Shoreditch, Beds are a bit impractical to get in and out of, Bed was comfy and I had a great nights rest Focused on the necessaries like good mattress bedding and pillows Large bath towels Uselful technology and free movies Hot shower 
219284,citizenM London Shoreditch, rooms was not as clean as we would have liked and as a tall person the bed jammed in the end of the room is not super comfortable with 2 people lift system was frustrating and not working to the point that we ended up taking the stairs on a few occasions music in the reception area too loud , The concept of the hotel is good Modern Very friendly staff good breakfast Self check in the first time I have seen something like that work as well as it did Trip was for pleasure but think it would be better suited to younger solo business traveler 
219285,citizenM London Shoreditch, The shower was only warm not hot , Very comfortable bed Good location Room has an interesting design Is great for two people willing to sleep in the same very big bed But only two people are allowed per room so not good for a family of more than two that wants to be in the same room 
219286,citizenM London Shoreditch, However there was one huge thing missing for me and that was tea and coffee making facilities Part of enjoying a break away for me is making a morning coffee in the room and snuggling back in bed with news channel on Instead I had to get up get dressed and go down in the lift to the canteen in reception pay a fiver for a tea and coffee and take them back to the room which rather defeated the object If we stay there again which we probably will I will take my own travel kettle and coffee supplies , We were going to stay at The Hoxton but they have a no cancellation policy and frankly I couldn t afford to lose nearly 400 if our plans changed Who can Instead we booked into the citizenM on Holywell Lane and I must say we had a fabulous stay The aesthetic of the hotel is brilliant part boutique hotel part modern art gallery with a very relaxed vibe The staff are friendly and happy to help in any way they can The rooms whilst small had virtually everything we needed for stay free Wi Fi big tele fridge hairdryer and a king sized bed Every room has an iPad which is used to change the mood lighting adjust the temperature open and close the blinds and control the TV There isn t a separate bathroom as such more a shower loo pod in the room Sounds odd but it works in a streamlined kind of a way There are even copies of classic Penguin books and free movies 
219287,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, It is the second time I am staying with a CitizenM property the great thing about this brand is that they have an universal style within all of their properties and there are never surprises on what you will get The location is great and very convenient great places to eat nearby both cheap and posh easy transport connection helpful stuff daily cleaning bed is huge and blanket can easily cover 2 people very comfortably
219288,citizenM London Shoreditch, Would like hair towel as well as bath towel Blind let in a little too much light in the morning Dust on handrail on staircase from reception to main entrance needs a clean, Design style hotel Comfortable bed with goidbed linen Staff really helpful Great cocktails Good shower
219289,citizenM London Shoreditch, Not much to dislike Not close to the tube is the only downside And the bar knows how to charge , Love Spitalfields so this was a good location to be around Super hip interiors bright airy well designed loved the common areas Staff very friendly Thanks especially to Andrew 
219290,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, Superb location in a very trendy area with a wide variation of great restaurants and bars The hotel is very clean and has a great vibe The room is quite small however I loved it it was a perfect cosy size with enough room to move about The bed was massive and extremely comfy The added touch of being able to control everything in the room with an iPad was excellent and meant you never had to leave the bed to change the AC or lights Would definitely stay here again 
219291,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, The price was fantastic Really cool neighborhood as well Lots of bars and restaurants and coffee shops A cool hip neighborhood Room was perfect for 1 2 people Everything can be controlled by an ipad Staff was extremely friendly and gracious and helpful 
219292,citizenM London Shoreditch, The canteen was not very good at midnight when I wanted something to eat , Very modern and arty very comfy bug bed Fantastic mood lights and tv channels Room had a mini fridge Bar in the hotel was great great areas to sit and relax too 
219293,citizenM London Shoreditch, Although the staff were present there could ve been more of them to assist Especially during check in We had some challenges with the electronic door lock which meant we had to bang into the door in order to open it The thermostat didn t heat up the room when we turn the temperature up to 25c When we got back to our room after the event we could smell like a wast drain smell coming from the sink We sprayed some perfume in order to mask it and turned on the fan By morning time it was minimal but I reported it the staff so they could check the plumbing , The property was located close to the venue of the event we were attending The decor is incredible and the technology driven check in was quite impressive All of the staff were friendly and engaging and were more than happy to answer questions and assist us with any issues 
219294,citizenM London Shoreditch, Room was quite small narrow but the design around this was innovative and so no real problem, Quirky modern boutique hotel in trendy location Very comfortable king size bed Didnt feel cramped despite the small room area Mood lighting in the bathroom was a nice feature Cleanliness excellent would definitely recommend this hotel There was a glitch with the IT which meant you couldnt watch a film on the tv Without any prompting we were given complimentary drinks and breakfast as an apology which was very generous considering I hadnt even complained 
219295,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, Bed was huge Checking in was so easy The room had smart technology so everything was controlled by an iPad Really different and a bit eccentric So happy we booked here 
219296,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, Cool and quirky hotel in the heart of Shoreditch Smart Rooms are amazing Outside terrace was an extra bonus on the sunny evenings for enjoying a refreshment 
219297,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, Excellent location I requested an early check in and our room was ready at 10 30am thank you The bed was huge and extremely comfortable the smart room was impressive very clean power shower plenty of mirrors and lighting 4 minute walk from the bars and I ll definitely be staying again One of the best city hotels I ve stayed at in a while 
219298,citizenM London Shoreditch, The sink is not inside the bathroom and this is a bit uncomfortable I had to pay a 29 surcharge for the early check out 3 30 am this is unacceptable after paying the room for that night Be careful , The location is excellent and the nearby Old Street metro station allows you to reach all London s sights Also the hotel is close to Liverpool Street Station and it s a great choice if you need to reach one of London s airports This is a very modern hotel with an interesting interior design great facilities and helpful staff The room is quite small but you probably won t be spending much time there anyway You can control everything with an iPad lighting blinds music movies alarm clock etc amazing 
219299,citizenM London Shoreditch, Not leaving towels in the bath seems to confuse staff we had 6 towels at the end and run out of Kleenex and Toilet paper , Great location inside and outside Shoreditch is just a great part of London with a lot of different styles and food perfect for younger people Nice baar and good food in the hotel super friendly staff everything nice and clean Room controlled via ipad is an nice extra bonus 
219300,citizenM London Shoreditch, About the room itself it was never properly cleaned up only the day we arrive One day we even found a cleaning towel laying down next to the basin The plates from the restaurant were neither removed from the room Why , The staff is extremely friendly and helpful 
219301,citizenM London Shoreditch, The windows don t open so there was no fresh air in the room The bathroom smelled really musty and of drains which was quite unpleasant Also it wasn t super clean there was a layer of dust on the shelves and the hairdryer bag under the sink The tv channels were really random all German and Spanish channels And they don t do 24 hour room service as advertised Overall it suited our needs and was the perfect location for us but little things let it down which was a shame , The bed was big super comfy
219302,citizenM London Shoreditch, Slippers for the room please , A bit more variety on breakfast would be welcome nothing wrong with what s available but in Shoreditch therre are actually better breakfast places for cheaper prices
219303,citizenM London Shoreditch, The air conditioning was noisy which kept my husband awake and we were awoken by the noise of water going through the pipes presumably every time someone flushed their toilet Also the location wasn t great for us as we were in London to watch a show in the west end, The room was very clean and modern the bed was huge and very comfortable and the shower was very good We liked all the mod cons which made it very futuristic 
219304,citizenM London Shoreditch, Nothing Maybe a little expensive , Trendy Comfy high tech rooms iPad controlling the lighting TV etc Cool bar area good healthy buffet Same again at breakfast Free iMac to use and nice space to hang and do a bit of work the next day Love Citzen M hotels There all slightly different design wise but consistent in all the other ways 
219305,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, The mood lightsin the bedroom the ipad control the interior design of the property the easy checkin the staff was incredible helpful and friendly 
219306,citizenM London Shoreditch, breakfast in price, lovely modern room all ipad control tv curtains mood lighting free water and very comfy bed great bar area modern look loads of bars sightseeing and great food on your door step
219307,citizenM London Shoreditch, A false fire alarm went off on Sunday morning Hotel was nice send out emails later in the afternoon and apologize for it , The beds were really comfy Location of the hotel is great You can control anything in the room including lights and curtains via an iPad 
219308,citizenM London Shoreditch, nothing but a bit away from the city center of London but everything is reachable by the tube Liverpool street station is 5 min walking , The room design is perfect no matter if it s slightly small and I liked the unique brand style of the hotel as I stayed before in Citizenm New York and it was exactly the same amazing modern design I totally recommend for a couple in case the big size rooms is not a very considerable option 
219309,citizenM London Shoreditch, Although it was large the bed was not the most comfortable and there were only two pillows before we requested additional pillows which were brought to us by the friendly staff Also the room had a weird drainage like smell on arrival and it did feel like there was a lack of natural oxygen which made it difficult for both me and my girlfriend to get to sleep , If you are looking for a cool modern and stylish hotel this definitely ticks the boxes Our room which was on the 7th floor had west facing views and through the large window you could see clearly out onto the London sky which definitely was a cool surprise Nice touches like complimentary bottles of water in the mini fridge and the iPad controlled system which you could use for the TV which had a selection of free movies to choose from as well as other channels mood lighting alarms and the room temperature definitely pleased 
219310,citizenM London Shoreditch, The 8 43 fire alarm unsure if it was a drill or accidental especially as the check out is before 11am I really feel for the price it should be by 12 earliest , I liked the overall feel good fixtures and fittings and catchy design The staff are amazing and so friendly Such a special stay even if it was for one night 
219311,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, breakfast was great and with dedicated DJ to set the mood but 13p per night rooms are small but comfortable I have never been to a hotel with media system with comparable amount of adult video
219312,citizenM London Shoreditch, No kettle or tea making facilities in the room I m British therefore lack of tea making goodies is a cardinal sin , Really futuristic and fun very Blade Runner The room was fantastic 
219313,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, The staff was wonderfull They went above and beyond to help us when one of us got sick and were amazing on giving advice on the neighbourhood and transportation 
219314,citizenM London Shoreditch, some smell came up from toialett , Just Cool btw the only hotel up to now in UK where I got great coffee for breakfast Breakfast was good as well stuff is great too the room is funky 
219315,citizenM London Shoreditch, Everything was operated from an iPad and the TV didn t work properly It kept turning itself off randomly so even though there were some great free movies I wasn t able to watch them It seemed like too much trouble to get someone to fix it and I was wishing for a normal TV and remote that actually worked without a hassle , Love the design of this hotel the room is very modern and design very innovative My room had a big window with a blackout shade that went up and down remotely and the bed was tucked under it Liked the bar area and selection of snacks Staff was super helpful and friendly Seems very youth oriented but I was very comfortable even though I don t fit that age category 
219316,citizenM London Shoreditch, I was greeted by a staff member who told me to ask him about the area if I wanted to find out things to do nice except for that he also told me not to bother with his colleagues because They don t know what they re talking about The same employee was hanging around in the common area with some guests or friends one night later as they used crude language to talk about women within earshot of anyone who passed by myself included , The bed was really comfortable I appreciate the slick iPad tech powering the rooms and the modern self check in system is seamless and convenient The hotel itself is very well kept beautiful common areas that feel modern social and welcoming The staff is generally super friendly I would come back 
219317,citizenM London Shoreditch, The room got a bit dusty till the end , Excellent location for Shoredich small room but very comfortable and very well designed Nice lobby area great for a night cup Nice staff 
219318,citizenM London Shoreditch, It could have been my own fault but after a certain hour of the evening more like early morning for me they put all the food away However there was one night at 3am when I was very hungry and the bartender had a pizza made for me , The staff was personable and not too over the top with the always on customer service Meaning they were all very clearly individuals and they treated me the same There wasn t a customer service script like I hear at other chain hotels and I was able to have quite a few interesting conversations with the staff as a result I also really liked the open work concierge bar area It was a good place to mix with other guests 
219319,citizenM London Shoreditch, Looked more like hostel rather than hotel in terms of style and quality of the room We didn t like a window in the room which doesn t work for opening , Excellent position near Spitalfields market and also convient to arrive from Stansted airport 
219320,citizenM London Shoreditch, Some people might like a bit more space in rooms which are prob a bit smaller than avg for us it was fine though, Friendly and helpful staff convenient location massive bed and little noise pollution despite location 
219321,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, The Modern layout was really different to what we are used too we loved it The rooms were compact but actually really comfortable and cosy The staff were really friendly 
219322,citizenM London Shoreditch, No parking always sucks Not being able to turn the aircon off gives me a headache and disturbed sleep , A tiny but perfectly formed room The awesome iPad controlled smart room controlling everything from the blinds to the light colour and tv Lush bed and very stylish hotel as a whole 
219323,citizenM London Shoreditch, Breakfast expensive for what you get but it s nice There s a Pret A Manger just down from the hotel so may be cheaper to eat there Hotel could also be better signposted , Modern funky hotel small but adequate Rooms are clean but very small however they re fine for anyone just looking for somewhere to sleep that wouldn t be spending much time in the room The area is quite hipster with an up and coming kind of vibe Hotel very near tube station 
219324,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, Awesome awesome place definitely recommend Ver cool and helpful staff and nice bar The rooms are very cool as well One of my favorite accommodations ever 
219325,citizenM London Shoreditch, The only potential uncomfortable thing is the bathroom which is only some sort of capsule with very thin walls and barely isolated and sound proofed So if you travel with someone and you are not at very high intimacy levels using the bathroom may be a bit strange , The hotel is a good buy for the area and for the price You cannot find anything better at that comfort level for what they are charging 
219326,citizenM London Shoreditch, The room is very compact but the large window means it doesn t feel too cramped , Nice relaxed vibe to the hotel friendly staff quiet room Location is good just not close enough to where I needed to be 
219327,citizenM London Shoreditch, Food wasn t great canteen style help yourself for 16 All a bit dried up and not particularly nice Only two choices salmon or beef , Room was nice clean and well set out
219328,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, The bed was super comfy and everything was controllable via iPad I ve stayed in a lot of hotels where the toilet shower are have been within the room rather than a separate room however the extra couple of curtains made it more private and reserved 
219329,citizenM London Shoreditch, The breakfast should be free Also i asked for a pimms and lemonade in the bar There was no strawberries and oranges the make the pimms , The bed was very comfy I like the soap and the fun furniture I felt very comfortable in the room I loved the view The staff were very friendly It was great that I could leave my luggage before I left the hotel 
219330,citizenM London Shoreditch, Very small room Also Bar man was quite busy chatting up some girls at the end of the bar rather than serving us Shame because the drinks were lovely , Cool room layout utilises the small space well Nice cocktails Good quality fixtures and fittings 
219331,citizenM London Shoreditch, Didn t really appreciate the lack of choice of food in the canteen area and a bit overpriced but I guess that is what brings in the money when the rooms were the best priced out of the area , The bed was large and super comfy The fact that the room is all controlled via iPad is pretty slick and cool Loved the decoration and the efficiency of the hotel Really maximised the space of the place by installing the shower and toilet together and it kind of reminded me of a nice student studio room 
219332,citizenM London Shoreditch, Lack of coffee I read that as there was no kettles coffee was available for free It turned out we had to pay for it which was a shame , Loved the mod cons and the really really comfy bed The rain shower was fab 
219333,citizenM London Shoreditch, I would prefer with the bathroom design the washing sink can be included in the bathroom instead of designing it outside the bathroom though , I like the design and the function of the hotel room and also with the overall of the hotel The room makes it extra unique than the other hotels is function my boyfriend and I enjoyed it a lot while staying at this hotel D
219334,citizenM London Shoreditch, I pad used to control room seemed to have very poor battery life , The bed was superb room designed very well and feels much larger than it is close to liverpool street station which made it very easy to get to and from stansted airport 
219335,citizenM London Shoreditch, Good breakfast just a little boring after the first days The lounge looked really tempting but there was a smell some detergent maybe that broke the magic , Staff was ultra kind And the room experience was great with a little Black Mirror twist Cozy lounge Perfect Wi fi 
219336,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, Great hotel very clean and in a good location The rooms aren t the biggest but are clean with everything you need Has a cool feature to control much of the room via an iPad which also gives you a number of films to watch Recommended 
219337,citizenM London Shoreditch, I found the aircon in the room quite loud and difficult to sleep to There s no way of shutting it off , Designed and beautiful Great location Easy check in and checkout 
219338,citizenM London Shoreditch, They could do with more lifts so get a lower floor so you can use the stairs Not close to parks if you want to run , Simple format well executed Extremely quiet considering location 
219339,citizenM London Shoreditch, Could benefit from more electric sockets especially one near a mirror although has a variety of international ones Canteen open 24 7, Quirky hotel Clean and adequately equipped
219340,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, Actually it s one of the most amazing experience in my life with this hotel my plan was to stay tow days but I took 12 days everything is excellent and what a lovely friendly staff specially Chiara Laura
219341,citizenM London Shoreditch, The air conditioning failed to maintain a constant room temperate Even on the lowest temperature setting it would not cool the room during the night time , Excellent location in Shoreditch and a very modern hotel with great facilities and helpful staff Really enjoyed the integrated tablet for all of the rooms electronics lighting curtains etc 
219342,citizenM London Shoreditch, I wasn t bothered by any outdoor noise but when I checked in my original room was facing the nightclub on the opposite side of the road As I have difficulty sleeping one of the hotel staff kindly suggested an alternate room , Loved the overall vibe of the hotel The staff are very friendly and helpful The communal working areas lounges bar and canteen were amazing I loved being able to make myself my own meal it was quick reasonably priced and delicious The bar was great 
219343,citizenM London Shoreditch, The breakfast was not very good for the money we paid The bedroom and lounge area was very comfortable The iPad which was suppose to operate the tv lights etc did not work and even though we put it into charge overnight it still did not work the following morning it was a good job we found the tv remote in the drawer under the bed , The bed was very comfortable and the hotel was ok for a one night stay 
219344,citizenM London Shoreditch, Rooms were a bit small I have a big suitcase and had trouble making space to open it up Everything was very clean except one day when we found a towel with traces of make up that had apparently survived the washing machine That was no problem though we had enough towels Music in the lobby breakfast room was a bit too loud I d prefer something quieter and more relaxing especially in the morning , Very good location next to overground station about 10min walk from tube next to bars and restaurants Friendly staff excellent breakfast WiFi worked great Loved the books in the room Breakfast is until 11 00 every day no need to set an alarm clock just for the breakfast and until 14 00 on Sundays perfect for brunch 
219345,citizenM London Shoreditch, Booking com say you can pay cash although this isn t an option at the hotel, The staff are super friendly the whole concept is just perfect and really modern 
219346,citizenM London Shoreditch, Only negative thing We stayed for 3 nights After the 1st night we did not leave our towels on the floor meaning we want to use them again They were replaced After the 2nd night I explicitly wrote a note to the housekeeper saying that we would be fine with the same towels and would not need new ones for just one more night They were replaced again It might me meant well but I think it was a waste and ecological non sense to exchange towels 3 days in a row shower floor hands 5 towels each day , CitizenM in Shoreditch is a great place to stay and good value for money The staff were all very friendly the room was clean and modern and had everything that was needed I liked the young and modern atmosphere in the lobby bar lounge areas it s a cool place to have a drink or two and or to plan your next steps in London the world Check In as well as check out worked well and was quick It s made more efficient by using screen displays comparable to the airport check in screens whether that s good or bad I leave to one self I would especially mention the good location It s very close to Shoreditch High Street Station and centrally located to explore hip Shoreditch s bars restaurants etc I would def go again 
219347,citizenM London Shoreditch, Absolutely nothing , The staff are so friendly I pre advised the hotel that this trip was for my wife s birthday The room on arrival had birthday cake Red Velvet balloons and well wishes on the wall Also moved to a room with amazing views with 2 drinks at the bar for the evening Now that is a first for us and it made everything that much better with an awesome start Great location to explore from Plenty of wall art in the area and loads of fantastic coffee shops Well done Cz M 
219348,citizenM London Shoreditch, Being a lone traveller tea and coffee making facilities in the room would have been appreciated I like a cuppa as soon as I open my eyes , It was so welcoming clean and light The staff were great Lovely selection of buffet food and 24 7 availability for drinks and snacks 
219349,citizenM London Shoreditch, There was so much construction going on around the hotel The closest bus station was closed the whole time of my stay , The details in the hotel are really nice It was really nice that the breakfast catered for gluten free and vegan diets Almond milk was also available 
219350,citizenM London Shoreditch, Room was VERY small and the sink was in the room itself not in the bathroom , Good location very clean great staff easy and quick check in and check out free movies and TV series huge bed 
219351,citizenM London Shoreditch, The room was pretty small and the bathroom toilet combination a little odd and didn t offer much privacy , Great hotel is fantastic location The rooms are quite small but you probably won t be spending much time there anyway I loved the hi tech nature of the room where you control everything with an iPad They also have a really cool area to hang out downstairs which we would ve liked to enjoy more but there s just so many other other things to do in London 
219352,citizenM London Shoreditch, Could have been tea and coffee making facilities in the room , Liked the iPad that controlled everything in the room from the lights and TV to the blinds Particularly loved the mood lighting and free movies on demand The bed was huge and super comfy The staff were particularly helpful welcoming and friendly 
219353,citizenM London Shoreditch, Couldn t fault the hotel at all , The hotel and room was very modern loved the mood lighting is the room and how everything could be controlled via the iPad Hotel very quirky with self service check in check out Overall Loved it Already planning our next stay 
219354,citizenM London Shoreditch, No tea or coffee in room , Very attentive helpful staff Asked for a pillow and it arrived in moments Room excellent bed comfy Breakfast very good Large TV free films Good view 
219355,citizenM London Shoreditch, Trendy hotel could make it more advanced with dimable lights auto opening blinds at set wake up time etc , Closed heating ventilation cooling system blowing all the time difficult to arrange temperature ventilation Prefer to have a window to open Maybe filters not clean 
219356,citizenM London Shoreditch, To me the hotel is basically an easyHotel dressed up in hipster clothes to justify an exorbitant price tag An iPad mini installed with a few gimmicky controls to change the colour of the light bulbs does little to make up for the cramped room and lack of the basics like a mini bar with a few refreshments or even I dunno tea and coffee facilities Sorry I expected a little more for my money , The bar cafe reception area has a calm cool vibe and the self check in is simple The hotel is positioned in a great location and the rooms are super clean well designed and most importantly to me well sound proofed 
219357,citizenM London Shoreditch, Only down side was when we asked for room service we had to go and collect our items three or four times which meant getting dressed again etc First night they delivered room service permefctly fine , Me and my grilfiend loved the iPad controlled room with mood lighting and Apple TV All these little features made the stay that little bit extra exciting The food and room was fantastic and the staff were brilliant 
219358,citizenM London Shoreditch, Music in canteen somewhat to loud if you want some conversation , Met my expectations of an out of the ordinary hotel Liked the concept however it may be more suitable for a younger urban and mobile crowd Great comfortable mattress wonderful down comforter and pillows Super WLAN Great selection of TV channels and movies Liked the location Shoreditch Hackney Spitalfields 
219359,citizenM London Shoreditch, More British tv channels please I could do without the many German and Italian ones but that is just me I am sure other guests are delighted The staff was great young and funky however I witnessed a very patronising instruction of a new member in staff in coffee making which the man in charge did not handle very well And the instructions should have waited until I had left , Best hotel ever In a great and very interesting district Close to public transport Great modern concept Friendly and amusing staff Good food Good coffee Lots of reading matter Free internet access And now for the best The room comfy bed great duvet two big pillows Smart ligthing with mood lights which I absolutely loved Rainforest shower head uuuuh I want one at home Free films Lots of tv channels AM shower gel and shampoo and PM shower gel and shampoo in generous large bottles Big fluffy towels Smart interior design and functional too I am a citizenM for the duration 
219360,citizenM London Shoreditch, The room was really small we felt quite claustrophobic The bed was huge however it was the full length of the room meaning you couldn t walk up to the window It was really small No window to open Other than this it was lovely , Bed was really comfortable 
219361,citizenM London Shoreditch, Nothing , Staff are very helpful and friendly Neighborhood is great full of restaurants and bars and clubs Hotel is very user friendly easy check in and easy check out Rooms can be controlled with an iPad Very modern Great showers Very secure hotel Small rooms but exactly what we needed 
219362,citizenM London Shoreditch, Great hotel, What a great concept hotel The vibe in this hotel is awesome and the staff are super friendly keep up the great work we loved it here and will definitely be back
219363,citizenM London Shoreditch, Nothing, The hotel is a great combination of amazing design in every aspect and old style friendliness and service The staff are irreverent funny and can t help enough I d recommend this place to anyone 
219364,citizenM London Shoreditch, Would like to have had tea coffee making facilities in the room , The hotel was vibrant and funky The rooms were light and spacious Comfortable and modern I really liked being able to switch everything on and off from the iPad including the blinds etc 
219365,citizenM London Shoreditch, Tiny room with a sink in the room and not in the so called bathroom The bed filled the end of the small room so don t expect to climb in from either side as you have to crawl over your partner if you want the bathroom Oh and the bathroom has no soundproofing pretty embarrassing if you aren t open minded This place is fine for teenagers but not for grown ups doing business Wayyy too small and cramped Not even a wardrobe or iron Style over substance for sure and hideously expensive for what you get I m going back to The Hoxton or Hilton thanks , Location
219366,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, Fantastic hotel in a fantastic location Ten minute walk from Liverpool Street Station We even had the pleasure of watching a famous London street artist at work from the restaurant balcony 
219367,citizenM London Shoreditch, WC shielded from the rest of the room by thin glass wall Not much privacy , This hotel is ideal if you are traveling alone Location is awesome all excellent caf s in walking distance 
219368,citizenM London Shoreditch, Very very disappointed we had to pay for an extra night because we checked out 1hr after check out time we will not use booking com again The hotel would have cancelled if we had booked direct with the ,No Positive
219369,citizenM London Shoreditch, Unfortunately we did have a staff member leave our door open one evening not an ideal situation , CitizenM great hotel in Shoreditch close to public transport and plenty of great restaurants nearby to enjoy Beds were comfortable and rooms were perfect for what we were looking for Definitely recommend it if you want to stay in this area 
219370,citizenM London Shoreditch, I would prefer a coffee tray in my room have suggested they ask guests at time off booking then leave if required , Brilliant comfy bed the living rooms the STAFF 
219371,citizenM London Shoreditch, I wanted to be able to make a cup of tea in my room and there are no facilities for that I got too hot under the duvet but if I turned the air con down it was really noisy and I couldn t sleep , The bed was very comfortable good shower and the room very dark Good choice of movies 
219372,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, Amazing bed great shower and love the mood lighting Also the wonderful staff helped me surprise my partner with balloons and bubbly for his birthday 
219373,citizenM London Shoreditch, No tea making facilities in the bedroom meaning I had to go down to the 1st floor from 6th to get a tea couldn t get room service as wanted to pay seperately , Breakfast had a good selection Bedrooms are very modern clean and comfy Shower was amazing Location was ideal to get to anywhere Old Street and Liverpool Street stations are both a short distance away to get the tube into central London all zone 1 
219374,citizenM London Shoreditch, Room could have been a bit bigger with tea and coffee in room , Bed was comfy Felt like we were in a spaceship in a good way Views across London spectacular 
219375,citizenM London Shoreditch, Music was very loud It was hard to sit and do some work I had to take a conference call but could barely understand the participants even when using earphones , On walking distance to the tube
219376,citizenM London Shoreditch, Room is a bit on the small side Sink outside the bathroom Housekeeping could be better at execution No gym , The location is fantastic Right in the heart of Shoreditch with all the restaurants art scene etc The rooms are small but well appointed The bed is large and super comfortable and the room is super stylish and the shower is awesome The lobby is cool laid back and has a great vibe and views The staff are super friendly and on top of their game By far the coolest hotel I have stayed in London High tech room Check in is self service and so easy 
219377,citizenM London Shoreditch, HAD TO WAIT LONG TIME FOR COFFE IN THE MORN ING AND THAT BEING VERY PICKY LOL, COMFY BED LOVE THE IPAD TO WORK EVERTHING MOOD LIGHTING BLINDS TY ETC GREAT SHOWER BER VERY GOOD AND BREAKFAST VERY GOOD
219378,citizenM London Shoreditch, Rooms quite pokey so no bath but perfectly adequate for single night , Really comfortable bed and excellent shower Very helpful staff Superbly insulated from the adjacent railway line wouldn t have known it was there Nice communal areas 
219379,citizenM London Shoreditch, The addition of a small kettle and tea coffee making facilities in the room would be great , The bed and pillows were super comfy best we ve ever had in any accommodation and we ve stayed in many 
219380,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, brilliant staff amazing room especially considering the cost Got to watch Rogue One from their free movies as well so couldn t have been better 
219381,citizenM London Shoreditch, The food in the restaurant was a little disappointing We wanted to have dinner there our last night but all they had was salmon lamb and sushi Those seem like strange choices I would have been happy with any beef or chicken or even a vegetarian main Unfortunately that wasn t an option It was nice that they had drinks and food that you could bring up to the room at all hours great for midnight snacks , The bed was amazing It s huge had a big window and tv The staff was really friendly and understandable We had to change rooms the one they gave us was a handicap room and a bit uncomfortable They were so reasonable and understanding The shower and mood lighting is hilarious and amazing It s a great location for going out in Shoreditch Tons of bars and restaurants around the area and very easy to get to any of the sights 
219382,citizenM London Shoreditch, Wish they had bigger rooms , First of all Shoreditch is a great area love staying here when I travel Second CitizenM was a very pleasant surprise The hotel itself is very artsy lots of inspiration for the artistically inclined The bar and lounge on the main level is awesome everyone super friendly and easy place to meet other travelers if you re alone The room itself is small but bed is HUGE and TV has a lot of channels if you just want to relax In the lobby they even have computers for you to browse the web or print documents out 
219383,citizenM London Shoreditch, The washing facilities were not cleaned or the rubbish removed despite being left out ready to be taken during our stay but the towels had been folded back up so someone had been in Otherwise everything was great , The colourful decor everywhere The lounge area very relaxing atmosphere to enjoy coffee so it was ok that there were no facilities in the room actually made a nice change The staff were very helpful suggesting restaurants nearby unfortunately many were full so ended up in one not so busy and found out why 
219384,citizenM London Shoreditch, The only little but was that Citizen M hotels do not have gym even a small one with few fitness machines or weights would be top of the cake Also they are not thought for business but would be nice to organise one meeting there , The hotel is well communicated by public transport as it is located besides Shoreditch train station and within short walking distance 10 minutes max to Liverpool Street I found the neighbourhood very charming with a hipster vibe and full of trendy small beautiful shops and restos at the high street I had been in another Citizen M in London before and did not disappoint me at all on the contrary the comfort and quality standards are very high great bed and shower strong wifi and free a la carte movies menu and the ratio quality price is one of the best in London I have been in stinky B B slightly cheaper Staff is super nice and makes your stay very easy and pleasant They are friendly and professional at the same time My friend is italian and she felt like at home as many of them are italians and they included piadina in the 24h buffet I am a happy guest and will keep loyal to Citizen M and certainly repeat in this or another one next time I am in London 
219385,citizenM London Shoreditch, I selected the alarm function which literally only stops when you get out of the bed I will def set the alarm on my own phone next time , Breakfast was really really good I definitely recommend having it The bed is also very comfy and big I really enjoyed that the room was very modern and you could manage everything with the iPad 
219386,citizenM London Shoreditch, There was not a clearly defined front desk so I think the below issue could have been resolved sooner if we called 0 instead of speaking with a staff member in the lobby , The lights in our room stopped working and we told staff and went out for the day The lights still did not work when we came back So we called 0 on the phone and natalie was at our room in 5 minutes to trouble shoot on the iPad what controls the lights and everything in the room which is very cool So we got a new room right next door which a quick and convenient fix 
219387,citizenM London Shoreditch, Nothing but issues when trying to pay for conference guests Errors made with bookings constantly told that I had made mistakes when booking I had not Payments not taken by hotel so our guests were told they had to pay When I called the hotel was told that we could not pay via booking com and only can pay directly via website I have made many bookings via booking com where you have to pay in advance for best rate and have never had any issues Then received no show charges and was told because I had made duplicate bookings via booking com and directly on the hotel website Again this was not the case all the bookings were made via one source Overall staff very unhelpful when I tried to get this all sorted So much so that despite the location and the facilities rooms at the hotel I would not stay again Feedback from conference guests was that reception staff were very rude as well , Location was well situated for the conference Rooms good facilities were as expected 
219388,citizenM London Shoreditch, You couldn t get a non alcoholic cocktail at the bar I m pregnant and asked the guys at the bar to make me an non alcoholic drink few of my colleagues were having drinks but the bartenders told me that they could only offer me a soft drink I asked if they could skip the alcohol f ex in mojito but that wasn t an option It made me a bit sad because everything else was perfect , The bed was SUPER It was 100 the cleanest hotel I ve ever been to in London 
219389,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, The quirkiness of the hotel little writings on the pillow and the iPad that s hooked up to everything made it super easy The bed was huge and had a great nights sleep If you haven t stayed here yet and want value for money in a great location then this is a must
219390,citizenM London Shoreditch, bed could have been softer with an extra pillow or two ipad sometimes got confused and we couldn t get mood lighting to turn off or blinds to close also bathrobes would be a nice touch , all the convenient extras in the room mood lights movies climate blinds that you could control with the ipad felt like they really thought out the best way to use the space bed was very big and room was really comfy despite its small size check in and check out were super smooth breakfast was tasty if expensive and there were free blooody mary s on Sunday amazing staff was super helpful and fun cool bar and atmosphere would absolutely stay again also shoreditch is a cool spot with lots of bars and restaurants in walking distance 
219391,citizenM London Shoreditch, Would be nice to have tea coffee in the room for first thing in the morning , The beds are huge and very comfortable Fabulous shower too Enjoyed the free movies Really liked the public areas just like being at home 
219392,citizenM London Shoreditch, Breakfast could be included I ve stayed at Hilton s for less than this with breakfast included but I was still happy, Excellent location very close to Shoreditch high street Funky looking reminded me of a great memory I had in Thailand Awesome facilities 
219393,citizenM London Shoreditch, Window could have had the option to open Everything else was perfect , Fantastic location 2 minute walk from over ground Shops restaurants and bars only a short walk Hotel was amazing so different to anything I ve every stayed in quirky and unusual Rooms were on the smaller side but it didn t matter Nice big comfy bed Free movies and music Definitely be returning Staff were very helpful Didn t have the breakfast but it looked amazing 
219394,citizenM London Shoreditch, There were no options to have fresh eggs for breakfast only pre prepared scrambled eggs I was after a proper full English and was disappointed Very minor issue though I ll stay in the hotel again when I m in London , Great location Rooms are small and podlike but they re well designed so this is fine Bar is well stocked and open until 2 30 a huge bonus in the UK Hotel is super hip and I never saw a staff member over 25 Feels a little like Children Of The Corn However they re all super happy and friendly so it works Maybe the tattooed bar tender needs to read up on what pisco is kind of like tequila is just wrong but this is a small thing Great location too super interesting area Great T Shirt store called We Admire a few meters away and a great whisky bar Bull In A China Shop around the corner 
219395,citizenM London Shoreditch, Our Apple TV didn t work and when we went for a beer at the hotel bar the IPA tap had ran out Our bar lady went over to the bar man to ask him to change the tap and he said I can t be bothered just tell them we ve ran out , The bed
219396,citizenM London Shoreditch, The room wasn t fully cleaned The bedsheets were not changed Permanent dust , Seeing Shoreditch from the 9th floor Loved the facilities and concept of this funky place 
219397,citizenM London Shoreditch, Not right next to a tube station, Love their style bar is cool and not silly prices for a hotel staff are cool check in very modern and straightforward perfect for what we wanted 
219398,citizenM London Shoreditch, Super TINY room and even tinier bathroom Disappointed with the cleanliness sheets were never changed during my week long stay and it felt that the bathroom sink was wiped down in haste rather than cleaned Very laissez faire so don t expect a doorman to help you with luggage flagging down a taxi , Friendly staff and excellent location a few minutes walk to Liverpool St Station Loved the free films available to watch on TV and the free bottled water in the fridge Canteen area on first floor pretty cool and I appreciated my room being available for early check in on arrival 
219399,citizenM London Shoreditch, Very pretentious wouldn t be a cosy hotel not very friendly, The room was small but very well laid out The hotel room was very quiet also with no disruptions from outside
219400,citizenM London Shoreditch, It s a bit of a schlep from any tube stations but there are plenty of buses and the surrounding streets aren t overly inviting but you re not far from some funky eateries and why would you want to leave the hotel anyway , Super stylish hip and with tons of nice design features Didn t realise until I opened the black out blind in the morning that I was right above a railway line the noise insulation is that good High quality bed linen and a great shower 
219401,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, Great location in the middle of Shoreditch very close to nice restaurants and shops Away from mainstream shops but in the middle of a cool area of London The staff was very helpful the drinks at the bar were amazing and the rooms super fancy I would definitely recommend this hotel to any tourist that does not necessarily need to be close to the main tourist attractions
219402,citizenM London Shoreditch, I d have liked a larger room bathroom, Bed was as good as I expected it Pillows are a bit high Two thinner ones might be better to offer Sometimes was hot and room temp only drops to 18 so a sheet would have been nice to offer 
219403,citizenM London Shoreditch, It was expensive and I paid over the odds for a room with no breakfast, Really beautifully designed rooms bedroom and downstairs areas Very comfortable Staff were really helpful Room was quiet Bed was incredibly large and comfy 
219404,citizenM London Shoreditch, Confirmed I was able to have a late checkout and then got called by the manager during normal checkout while sleeping and he was heated on the phone We worked it out but I felt like he should have double checked Also the iPad which controls the room is neat but constantly low on battery , Staff was nice the team behind the bar made a nice cappuccinos and were upbeat but not overly friendly or fake The rooms are small but cozy Style is great There are lighting presets which sounds weird but is fun Reminded me of a Yotel for the City as opposed to an airport Enjoyed the lobby atmosphere and the proximity to Liverpool St station and Brick Lane is great 
219405,citizenM London Shoreditch, I thought there would be more to the food option so felt a little disappointed against my expectations What I did have was good but would probably eat out when I stay again , Good room modern and funky but retained comfort factor All clean and well supplied Good check in and attentive staff I would return here Good vibe and felt comfortable as a solo traveller Rather lovely cocktail Free movies a nice value add 
219406,citizenM London Shoreditch, Drinks in the bar were good but quite expensive, Bed was really comfy room was very good value location is fantastic and within walking distance of station
219407,citizenM London Shoreditch, The rooms are a bit small and intimate especially for 2 people You should know each other very well because shower toilet are just a cubicle inside the room, Everything This is the coolest hotel we ve been for years Everything in the room is digital and is directed by an iPad
219408,citizenM London Shoreditch, I had to go find the cleaning trolley to replenish the toilet rolls on arrival their weren t any at all in bathroom Nice US UK Europe Plug combination in room BUT only one of them Missus complained that no mirror near that one socket Would have made her hair do a little difficult if she hadn t brought her own mirror There was a duster underneath the duvet in our room not a biggy but that and missing toilet rolls hints at staff training issue , Location is Shabby Chic if you like that sort of thing Walking distance for everything we needed I like the brand and was a comparable stay to the Schiphol Citizen M

219410,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, Loved it here Great location for wandering around Shoreditch and all it offers The modern pod like rooms are bigger than we expected and having an Ipad to control everything in the room including allowing Netflix streaming etc was a real bonus We had great fun with the mood settings in the room It s a sociable hotel with the lounge dining area having loads of quirky space to sit and relax We actually spent more time in the hotel than we expected as we really enjoyed the atmosphere in here The drinks at the bar were reasonably priced too What really makes this a good hotel is the staff We thought with electronic check in etc that there wouldn t be many staff We were wrong They re still there helping you check in advising places to go ringing you a cab etc And they were all happy relaxed fun and helpful just like the vibe of this hotel 
219411,citizenM London Shoreditch, had a minor issue with the lights in the room but someone came up to help immediately , The design of the hotel amazing The expansive lobby area with plenty of space to work have coffee eat breakfast etc 
219412,citizenM London Shoreditch, The breakfast option is quite limited poor selection of choices No room service Food available 24 7 in the lounge area but during the weekend this place is extermely loud and full of drunkies , Great location Usre frendly hotel very clean room exactly like on the photos which sometimes is not the case Modern look and design 
219413,citizenM London Shoreditch, Prices per day vary depending on availability of rooms You have to pay upon check in so extended your stay can be a bit of hassle Standard of housekeeping was a bit inconsistent Cleanliness was good but they often forgot to leave fresh bottles of water and tidy up fully , Staff were very friendly and helpful Wifi is excellent throughout Location is right in the heart of Shoreditch within walking distance of many great bars and restaurants

219421,citizenM London Shoreditch, Ipad didn t work in bedroom which controlled lights too much opportunity for iPad to die and no operation control for TV lights curtains etc Room keys have not worked every time i have stayed at this hotel this was my 3rd trip Staff too relaxed and no customer service, Look and feel

219430,citizenM London Shoreditch, There was no hot water and no heating in the bathroom It was February so it was freezing cold When we informed the hotel staff about the issue they sent an email a week later offering us 50 discount on our next booking Very poor customer services , It is a very cool hotel the decor is unique and bedrooms have a big comfortable bed

219433,citizenM London Shoreditch, The rooms were very small but they maximized the space with the layout , The extra large bed was awesome Upon checking in the hotel felt a little too automated and trendy for its own good but I really liked all the extra touches like the personalized welcome on the TV and the iPad that controlled everything in the room from the curtains to the Hue lights I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will return Great value for the trendiness Good alternative to Ace Hotel 
219434,citizenM London Shoreditch,No Negative, The bed was huge The ambience is chilled and creative The food was really good too I d probably pay a bit extra to stay here over other hotels in Shoreditch when I m next down Self check in was very painless too Something more hotels could learn from

219448,citizenM London Shoreditch, The hotel reminded me of somewhere you would take a school trip to The rooms were tiny like walking into a storage crate adequate but that was it It s not good having to crawl over someone in bed to go to the loo because the bed is wedged at the far end of the room The bathrooms were seriously underwhelming and no privacy a glass capsule in a room with a door that doesn t fit is not appropriate ,No Positive
219449,citizenM London Shoreditch, unfortunately the air con was blowing cold air in our room minus one out side and they couldn t turn the air con off so we got extra blankets In fairness the staff did all they could to help , Fab location and very friendly staff nice and very different decor through out the hotel

219517,citizenM London Shoreditch, All was great but note this place is not where one finds peace and quiet after a long London day because of loud music on canteen and communal areas lots of technology to manage via an iPad in the room can be a bit annoying especially the lights because some cannot be switched off individually so it is either plenty of lights on or complete darkness in the room , Close to underground and DLR nice canteen and communal area friendly staff good food moderately priced drinks

219523,citizenM London Shoreditch, I was cold and increased the setting to 25 degrees and the room never heated up My credit card payment to Booking com was used as a holiding payment and citizenM charge 2 50 for credit cards so I had to pay by debit card The check in experience felt more like Premier Inn than a luxury hotel No walk around bed so a second person would have to climb over you to use toilets in the night The sink was in the bedroom not the bathroom , State of the art technology in the rooms

219547,citizenM London Shoreditch, Slightly too high tech Took me a while to work out the TV blinds lights etc, Very high tech Amazingly well designed to make the most out of every inch of space Helpful staff Buzzy atmosphere 
219548,citizenM London Shoreditch, The Basics No toilet paper in my room upon arrival even after 2 requests that evening I had to wait 12 hours for the next day and a third request to get a roll That s ELEMENTARY Watson No hot water in shower for 2 days being frustrated and annoyed I was given a note with an apology and 3 drinks on the house seriously first room I was given was for people with special needs looks nothing like the rooms shown on the hotels website I was not informed of the special room that has a strange feeling to it with all the handles on the walls stings coming down the ceiling in case of an emergency and wired bathroom its design is not practical for anyone No toilet paper hot water or good vibes had them reluctant to change my room Staff consists mainly of youngsters foreign and inexperienced Their friendly act probably requested as part of the hotel vibe came across at times as overly friendly to a point of rude crude and there were two occasions that were totally inappropriate In conclusion this new hotel trying to be young and hip comes across as underwhelming and inexperienced as much as it s members of staff first time and last time for me NO Recommendations on my part ,No Positive
219549,citizenM London Shoreditch, The iPad wasn t charging properly so going off a lot I had to use my own charger to charge it The cleaning person did Colect the glasses we have use the day before for champain No iron in the room, I love the vibe of the place and the staff members are super lovely

219552,citizenM London Shoreditch, Nothing, We stayed just the one night and thought the hotel was fantastic value for money The room was small but had everything you could possible want and being new was immaculate The shower was superb and the mini iPad to control everything was a great touch All in all perfect for a short stop over 
219553,citizenM London Shoreditch, Nothing wrong with the place at all, The bed was absolutely huge I had an absolute blast for the first 20 mins playing with the Moodpad The living rooms were brilliant nice big comfy sofas and don t even get me started on the cocktails didn t sample any of the food but what I did see looked and smelt amazing
219554,citizenM London Shoreditch, The bathrooms are a bit strange The whole room is like a blown up larger version of a Japanese capsule hotel and the bathroom seems as if you are in a strange tube for shower and toilet , The bed was large and comfy and the location is great The hotel is run somewhat futuristically and almost all on computers and iPads which was easy and fun for us but may be an annoyance for those less interested in technology 
219555,citizenM London Shoreditch, Bedrooms are compact which is fine Just beware that the bathroom forms part of your room so there is very little privacy particularly when using the toilet You have to be comfortable with your room partner , Location is perfect for shoreditch Lounge area is great although coffee needs improving

219561,citizenM London Shoreditch, Housekeeping kept removing outr large bath towels and we had to call the reception to request it for 3 of the 4 evenings that we stayed there There should be better training of housekeeping requirements, The staff went the extra mile to help me check in earlier than 11 am and also with storage of our bags
219562,citizenM London Shoreditch, The room was tiny looked and felt as if I were staying in a campervan If two people were sleeping in the double bed one person would have to climb over the other to get in or out bed up against three walls The washbasin was in the bedroom not the bathroom cubicle and the space for belongings was tiny only stayed two nights and felt claustrophobic Hated that EVERYTHING is controlled by an i pad can t even switch on a light at night to go to the loo without using the I pad , The bed and shower were both large but just emphasised how small everything else was

219573,citizenM London Shoreditch, If you re a room service lover be aware there isn t any though there is a good 24 hour bar with food downstairs , The room was small without feeling small How the designers utilised the space was genius Loved every aspect of my stay All gadgets lights TV music blinds etc controlled with the iPad mini by the bedside Blackout blind was great and combined with a very comfy bed made for a great night s sleep They seemed to think of everything including no extra cost movies and you could even stream content from your own device to the big TV They also offer a late check out for a very reasonable fee which was most welcome And that rain shower devine I will definitely be staying at Citizen M again Loved it
