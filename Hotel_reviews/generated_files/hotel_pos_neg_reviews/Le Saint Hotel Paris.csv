137407,Le Saint Hotel Paris, The First room they gave me 205 was unacceptable Dark small small bed no proper hanging locker and no proper shower It stood without stall in the middle of the tiny bath room so all water would flood the room I complained and they declined at first to change it The manager intervened and it was finally changed to 405 which was a proper room with correct bathroom When checking out I requested a taxi and they told me none was available since Paris was very busy and they advised me to wait in the street I followed the advise and found one 20 minutes later , The perfect location and breakfast in terms of quality of food and speed of service The restaurant serves good food 
137408,Le Saint Hotel Paris, Nothing not to like, Very comfortable room larger than usual for Paris Very helpful staff Excellent location Reasonable price Good dining room Good breakfast Overall an excellent package 
137409,Le Saint Hotel Paris, Hotel looks great in photos but please note eg marble bathrooms are tiled not real marble many fittings look good but are poor quality don t work properly shower door banging into rainfall shower head when opened etc Our rooms were stiflingly hot and we asked for them to be checked while we were at dinner The charming receptionist forgot to do that and when we returned we were given completely the wrong information about the in room heating system so we all had a very uncomfortable night with young children Staff the following morning were aware of the problem but not particularly interested ,No Positive
137410,Le Saint Hotel Paris, That we could only stay two nights then back to work, Very comfy bed and gorgeous little terrace with table and chairs Staff lovely will be difficult to find anywhere better for our annual return
137411,Le Saint Hotel Paris, Front desk staff in constant rotation so I couple of things minor fell through the cracks I think it would be better to have one person on site to help with bookings etc , The location is suburb The rooms are beautiful and quite spacious The restaurant and living room are beautifully appointed 
137412,Le Saint Hotel Paris, The room could be a bit more spacious given the price A full body mirror is on the closet door with dim lighting The water tap in the bath is very stylish but not so comfortable to use , A beautifully designed hotel in an excellent location The staff was very friendly and helpful the breakfast was of very good quality there is a good restaurant in the hotel and there is a SPA which I didn t use The bed was big and comfortable The hotel is situated on a quiet street between Saint Germain des Pr s and the Seine Mus e d Orsay and Mus e du Louvre are a short walk away
