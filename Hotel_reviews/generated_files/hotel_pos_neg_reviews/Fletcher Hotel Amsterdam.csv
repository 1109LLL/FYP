444964,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Lack of plug sockets Drying and straightening hair was a nightmare as wouldnt reach over to the mirror , Lovely decor in the room and the bed was extremely comfortable
444965,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Far from center 20 minutes to take metro by walking good for one or tow days maximum and amount in booking totally 235 80 and paid 243 98 Euro, Beautiful hotel design
444966,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The location is very inconvenient if you want to be in the city It s a far walk from the metro bus station to the hotel daytime wasn t too bad but I wouldn t recommend at night The shuttle from the bus stop to hotel is 3 Euros per person steep price for a short drive The view from our room was a juvenile detention center some fast food restaurants The hotel room itself is not comfortable if you re traveling with someone that isn t your partner The shower is in the center of the room so you have no privacy Also beware that in order for the electricity to function your room the key must be placed in the holder by the door So if you need to charge something while you re gone you ll be out of luck , The hotel is clean and the staff was nice 
444967,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The hotel itself is beautiful Very romantic perfect for a couple going away together Very friendly and helpful staff all in all 10 10 will defo be visiting again 
444968,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Bathroom was not cleaned very well we were struggling to get the hand soap refilled everyday bed sheets were not renewed everyday no gym coffee machine was not clean I got a water kettle and boiled water twice in it but not clean and smells rusty , Complimentary water clean towels beautiful view from breakfast area
444969,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Location is out of the way 15 min walk to station 20 min train to Central or a cab which is costly enough even with uber No fridge in rooms Wifi isn t the fastest Breakfast is 16euro which is quite steep for what you get , I loved how modern the hotel is and how the rooms are designed The sky bar and restaurant are so nice and give lovely views The hotel provide you with toiletries bottles of water no apples at reception daily which is a nice touch You can leave your cases in storage when checking out 
444970,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Ordinary staff like any other hotel but not that welcoming Double bed is twins standing together so you have to use one of twins anyway because of the space between them No information about room service after the restraunt close Really poor location , Architecture and interior Smoking area on the top floor
444971,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Kinda lousy workers on the desk Shower looks nice but not so handy Also for couples etc there is no privacy on toilet , Good location if you are using ur own car Nice looking hotel with lots of free car parking space Good sights from rooms
444972,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The shower in the middle of the room wasn t very ideal especially as it leaked onto the carpet Would have been helpful if it frosted over when in use The rooms had coffee facilities but not tea in the rooms, The hotel felt very modern staff very helpful and the beds very soft 
444973,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The customer service levels was poor among the staff Although our needs were responded to this was done in hast as oppose to real genuineness I even had to ask a staff member to smile during breakfast because it was too early in the morning for her face looked like sour grapes , Great buffet breakfast and the comfiest beds
444974,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The distance to town Dependent on train and taxi if not in own car, Staff was very helpful View from the bar and restaurant fantastic Close proximity to work
444975,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, It s a bit out of the way of the city centre public transport is cheap so it wasn t to much to get the train and walk to the hotel but late at night may be hard getting back to the hotel from Amsterdam city centre , The room was excellent very modern and i enjoyed my stay staff was great Excellent stay 
444976,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, This was the first hotel in Holland where we stayed We arrived early morning in Holland after a 10 hour flight so we where very tired but couldn t check in untill 2pm The lady on the reception was very nice but there was also a guy who was very rude We ask around 1pm if there was already a room available and he just let us stand there while not checking anything After a while he started a discussion with another receptionist who is gonna call to check if there is a room The hospitality really needs to be worked on Also the a c in our room did not work and we had to call the reception to control the a c from somewhere else so we could not manage the a c ourself The price is way to high for what you get I expected to be more luxury and better service , Room was alright Shower in the middle of the room was a nice change 
444977,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Overpriced considering the lack of facilities and location Extremely noisy work going on outside for 2 nights of the stay without any warning or apologies which somewhat spoiled the stay Staff were mixed some really good others not so good Air conditioning in rooms was next to useless based on talks with other guests seemed to be a problem on various floors Maintenance of rooms wasn t great either with various lighting problems , Good views from some areas breakfast was reasonable Hotel was quite nice and they ve clearly gone for a premium look which has come off nicely Overall not a bad hotel 
444978,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, No fridge in room door of toilet did not close rooms were not made up towels were not change breakfast extra 16 pp gave us a twin room even though we book a double booked not requested , The bed and pillow was amazing 
444979,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The air con is not very responsive in our case anyway We could not get the temperature to drop below 22 7 , The breakfast is excellent with a wide variety of foods The staff were always close by to assist should you need it We ate in the main restaurant one evening and we both thought the food was outstanding with a price that is in our opinion very reasonable located about 20 mins South of Amsterdam City the Metro 15 mins walk runs every 10 minutes service 54 The hotel provide a shuttle should you need it i e torrential rain A bargain at 3 each The local area should you like to explore has a large lake opposite where you can walk around and take in some of the local countryside a lovely spot with loads of waterfowl and other wildlife Overall we rate this hotel 8 5 out of ten and wouldn t hesitate to stay there again 
444980,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, First night staff were terrible didn t explain if card had been charged On the second night we got back and cleaner had left our room open all day we then got relocated to another room as compensation which was then given away with all of our stuff in the room Staff had no idea what was going on and it was due to the manager not keeping record After an hour of worry and hassle we were relocated to again another room and offered us free room service We received our room service an hour after and once again a great disappointment I am a strict vegetarian and received meat in my salad after clearly stating this to staff We also received no cutlery and got our drinks an hour after Upon complaining to the manager her excuse was our night staff are from a security place and what do you expect we are a big hotel Also the walk to the metro takes around 15 20 minutes taxi prices are ridiculously expensive and the hotels hourly shuttle is 3 euros each , I loved the idea of a different kind of room with a shower in the centre and a room with a view and I must say that didn t disappoint 
444981,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The distance from the station with no bus that goes past Like everyone else the fact that you have to pay for a shuttle which only goes once an hour Surely after so many moans they could offer it more often and free for the price you pay per room Also no plug near the mirror for hairdriers Too far out of town with no easy way to get back after 12 15, The shower in the room Quirky and the drinks prices 
444982,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The air conditioning was set to quite a low temperature and we couldn t turn it off completely , Enjoyable breakfasts nice bar and great views especially in the night 
444983,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Staff were not overly helpful somewhat cold Hotel is a while out of Amsterdam and doesn t have great direct public transport links , Modern hotel comfy beds nice bar and restaurant facilities
444984,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Condition of shower, Comfy large bed shower in the middle of the room is eye catching however it wasn t in the best condition Very nice place special place 
444985,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing Will use again next time I am in Amsterdam, Excellent value for Money free parking nice rooms a good restaurant on 17 floor very convenient
444986,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, It was a fantastic place to stay , They allowed me to check In early which was a huge convenience for me It was my first time staying in Amsterdam and they where very helpful with directions and teaching me the most efficient ways to travel to and from city central 
444987,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, You have to drive to get to the city centre and they do have a shuttle to take you to the Metro which is very handy so really you are able to travel from here if you don t mind the Metro, It was very clean and I m very cool Hotel
444988,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Hot drinks in room only coffee available and the coffee maker was a bit over elaborate and coffee was not replenished the next day , Very comfortable room free parking good links into city centre 
444989,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, It was all of a very high standard , Outstanding hotel accommodation food staff location attention to detail and a unique building with pleasant surroundings 
444990,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, in the one person bed the mattress is slipping when are getting in or out of the bed The mattress is not heavy enough , The view is stunning rooms are quiet even close to the highway He shower at the center of the room is a unique concept 
444991,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, This place is totally overrated and overpriced Staff was terrible and rude Very far from Amsterdam city center Not close to public transportation 20 20 minute walk Offers a Shuttle service to the closest transportation center as well as the airport but these much like the hotel are overpriced and not very helpful, Bed was comfy 
444992,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The location of the hotel was a bit far out from anywhere which it doesn t really state on the site so we had to walk about 10 15 mins to get the metro, The layout of the room and the hotel itself was really Morden and up to date 
444993,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, See above , Nothing I m traveling with my grandson and a shower in the middle of the room definately sucks I thought those were for honeymoon suites or romantic getaways I didn t like much about this hotel It was in the middle of an industrial area and way out of town 
444994,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, we had 2 problems the hotel is 20 min working from the station from some reason maybe based on wrong comments here in booking by other travelers we were under the impression that we can call to the hotel before coming back with a train to the station and request for a shuttle then we realized that we can get it only on a round hour which is far from being efficient in case you are coming 1o min later even when asking the hotel if the shuttle can wait 5 or maximum 10 more min for us to come we were refused other problem the beds are twin since the mattress is very soft you can actually fail between the beds , great hotel very nice room we liked the bath in the middle of the room very romantic grate breakfast modern decoration very nice view free apples at the reception were nice we didn t got our baby cot when we got to the room but it was fixed in 5 min so no really issue need to indicate also that the price is one of the lowest compare to other 4 rooms hotels in Amsterdam which make this deal very good and worth 
444995,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The breakfast is made up of low quality ingredients Seems like it has not been cleaned since the inauguration Everything is very worn out towels sheets The staff seems a bit confused at times, The concept and design is nice The parking is good Location 20 minute ride from airport 
444996,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Only disadvantage is location close to main road and a bit far from the centre, Very comfy bed and stylish room Shower very effective and quirky Great views and easy to walk to metro station Lovely bar but a bit expensive
444997,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The breakfast was very good The room just small but very nice design and the hotel is very near the motorway and very simple to reach it Also the hotel is only 1 km from the Metro and Train Station for reach center Central Station in 20 minutes 
444998,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I will say as going with friends the shower situation was slightly awkward at first but it was soon fine but we are all very close as friends it depends who your staying with could be slightly awkward The Hotel shuttle service is good but it does cost 3 euros one way just my opinion but I do think this should be free to guests as it is barely a 5 min car journey but as i said opinion , We Had a nice stay at Fletcher hotel The beds are super comfy the room is just big enough for 2 people The bar and restaurant upstairs are beautiful just to sit and have a quite drink or to grab a morning coffee Don t remember his name but we had a lovely waiter on our first morning he definitely set our day to a good start so bright and bubbly it made a massive difference to our first morning We didn t eat in the hotel restaurant so unable to comment on the food but the setting is lovely The train station is about 15 20 min walk which was okay as we had lovely weather but the hotel do also run a shuttle service to the station very easy train journey to the central Overall had a nice stay would definitely consider staying here again if i came back to Amsterdam 
444999,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, water leaking from the shower out to the floor just detail maybe could be somehow prevented not to get wet the floor in the room , Great unusual expercience to stay in this hotel the design of the rooms and hotel itself is unique giving extra spirit to the stay Recommend for the fresh couples nice shower solution The view from the room was also amazing bar great kitchen we didnt manage to try Parking without any problems a bit further from the trains heading to the city but with hotel shuttle service every hour from hotel its ok when coming back its a nice 15 mins walk just straight from the train stop so easy to find really Worth to try it definitely 
445000,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, No soap dispenser in shower We stayed in king bed type of room and twin bed type Twin bed is not comfortable caving in Pillows no good Can reach by 15 min walk from metro station otherwise expensive , Unique design of shower Very friendly helpful staff
445001,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, A shower in the middle of the room is not what we like and rather disturbing no seperate bathroom is a design error of the this type of room, Bed was big and comfortable
445002,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The air conditioning in the room wouldn t change temperature , The hotel is a 10 15 minute walk to the nearest train tube station They do offer a transfer to it but they charge 3 50 Euros per person unless it is pouring with rain it is a waste of money 
445003,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Location is in the middle of nowhere 10 km from city center Metro is 2km far walking in a completely desert area Value not worthy the price paid, Nothing
445004,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, However there was no fridge in the room or any sort of place to keep some stuff cool Also the bed although was comfortable but the double bed was made of two single beds and the gap in the middle was bothering sometimes , The atmosphere in the hotel was nice in general The staff was friendly and helpful The shower in the room was very modern and interesting nothing i have ever seen before 
445005,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel was nice and clean but it was too far from city centre to take a transport that take you to city you have to walk about 15 min Rooms are a lot smaller than you expect With the same money you can have a similar room in the city centre , Staff was nice 
445006,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, No in room fridge No spa and massage service, A strange and outstanding design I liked the idea of the Bath being in the center of the room Private parking Quite Neighbour Bike rental
445007,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, shower cylinder is a great idea but there was no soap dispenser or anyway one could keep a soap bar , good clean room and good restaurants fancy to shower in a glass cylinder sexy
445008,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel is far from the city and the next train is 15 min by feet away the round window is lighted up all night and I was forced to close the curtains to cut the light out, This design hotel is special Nice skybar with a nice view and a shower in the middle of the room Windows are round and lightning is very warm and cosy 
445009,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The bed was comfortable and the shower was nice There is a smoking area terrace on the roof above the bar which is super convenient for smokers The terrace also has a good view over Amsterdam Zuidoost If you are attending an event at the Arena or Ziggodome this is a good location to stay 
445010,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, No fridge in the room No box of tissues in the room Price a bit high Location is not ideal if you want to go a lot back and forth to the Hotel , Loved the idea of having shower in the middle of the room Beds very comfy Room very clean Feels like living in a space ship Excellent supportive and very helpful staff Excellent room service
445011,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Arrived late at night to a poor reception staff welcome No porter or offer to help with luggage Staff uniform was really shabby There were mosquitos all over the reception desk Disappointing start No facilities as in pool or gym etc Had been told there was a frequent shuttle service On enquiry found out it was not that frequent and there was a charge for it each way Hotel location so remote Distance to metro is a good 15 20 minute walk It is then an additional 30 minute metro ride to centre of Amsterdam The pillows on the bed were terrible The towels worn out and thin No 24 hour room service Don t stay here , The wifi That s it 
445012,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The location only really picked this hotel as going to see a gig nothing really round there unfortunately no real great issue s with the hotel itself little expensive for its location I would say , The hotel itself being round shape the bar the lighting of the hotel
445013,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The bed was comfortable and the room was clean there are fast food restaurants nearby but other than the onsite restaurant you would have to travel for a meal there is a train station within 15 mins of the hotel you are one stop on the train from Amsterdam stadium so the location could be better for a fun break
445014,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Not suitable for business trips shower and toilet With no car difficult to access Soft bed , Very nice modern hotel very good but expensive breakfast 
445015,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Very late cleaning in the late evening the shower centrally in the room no walls the shuttle only to the metro station , Friendly stuff quiet place 
445016,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Naomi was especially helpful she dressed the bedroom beautifully for my partners birthday she also provided us with lots of additional coffees for our rooms she couldn t have done more for us 
445017,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Very remote from center of Amsterdam but that made for more of an adventure , Beautiful unique hotel especially at night Staff were very friendly and helpful Breakfast was great 
445018,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The walk from the metro is quite a distance especially after a long day walking around Amsterdam Online it stated a free bus but at the hotel it is 3 per person per trip , The beds are really comfy However it s 2 beds pushed together and can leave a large gap in the middle so not the best for cuddly couples 
445019,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The breakfast was bad 09 10 ran out of yoghurt already but never refilled up again Very little choices of breakfast quite disappointed , The location andcleanliness of the room are good 
445020,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I burnt myself in the shower when the heat suddenly went up The location is about a 20 minute walk from the train station to get to schipol , The shower was in the middle of the room novel although lacking privacy The decor was great the bed was soft and the television showed the football 
445021,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Staff rude and never around Slow service in all dining rooms Thin mattress Even when you say your going to leave as unhappy they just let you leave All in all awful experience and I would advise others not to stay ,No Positive
445022,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Toilet shower in room shower tray fills up so u have shower in stages sink stupid shape no tissues no glass in room water in showered goes one way cold to hot so u freeze then burn lock systems dodgy first day there was coffee then no refill table in room keeps toppling off two smallest beds 2 tiny pillows noisy between rooms etc etc, Nothing
445023,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, That the hourly shuttle from and to the train station is 3 per person each way I guess it would be excellent if these charges were included but only charged for shuttle request outside those dedicated hourly journeys, The bedrooms are amazing
445024,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I think it will be nice to have a mini fridge and a more modern coffee machine in the room , The Design it s incredible It has a transparent shower cabin in the middle of the room it s sexy 
445025,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Well the tube shower is awesome but to keep the room refreshed the air con has the tendency to make the room a bit cold as to avoid mold but the shower made it worthwhile Also a bit far from the city centre 10 mins walk 10 mins by metro It s not that bad but you ve gotta be careful with the last metro at around 11 30 or the taxi is around 50 , Wonderful view Loved the lighting and the romantic atmosphere they give Great variety of wines The beds were super confy and the food was delicious We had a great time ordering room service and having breakfast there All was perfectly cooked and they had a great variety again with croissants salamis in general and English breakfast Smiley and friendly staff 
445026,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Location far from the center of Amsterdam no free shuttle to the nearest metro station Staff unfriendly Toilet no privacy at all Light switches on off automatically Showerdoor was leaking so we had a wet floor Housekeeping I have no words to explain how bad it is , Nice building design
445027,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I ve ended up finding out that the towels were not clean after coming out of the shower not a nice experience the housekeeper didn t bother to replace the towels after the room was vacated by previous guests, It was 15min walk to Metro station
445028,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The location is too far out to be considered a city hotel the hotel advertises a shuttle bus service to and from the nearest train station which is around 1 mile away however in reality this shuttle only operates once every hour and cost 3 euros per person per ride also the shuttle stops operating at 9pm which is not much good if you have plans to dine out in Amsterdam At approximately a mile it is not far to walk however if you have spent the day wandering the streets of Amsterdam that mile walk back to the hotel becomes quite tedious Also due to the location and time of travel to and from the city 15 mins train 10 min walk it is not easy to pop back to the hotel for a rest or drop off any items you buy meaning once you leave in the morning you will be out for the whole day The bar service was very slow with the staff often seemingly forgetting your order There was no water in the bedrooms and when we asked at the bar could we buy a bottle of water we were given the option of sparkling water or tap water as they had no bottles of still water Although there is a coffee machine in the room there were no glasses to even have a drink of water if you wanted Oddly enough a bottle of water appeared in our room on the very last day perhaps it should have been there all along Travel to and from the airport is easy enough by train however there is a real lack of information in this respect with guests being pushed towards the airport shuttle which costs 17 euro each where as the train cost only 5 euro each and only took 25 minutes including 1 change , The bed was really comfortable the hotel and rooms have a modern and unique style Breakfast was ok with good selection of items reception staff were friendly enough but not particularly helpful when asked about travel to and from city or airport 
445029,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I was very upset because when I book it said that there was a shuffle service included to the nearest metro estation that was about a mile away from the hotel and there they wanted to charged us 3 each way to take us Very frustrating and disappointing , I really like the room and the hotel estructure Easy to find and convenience parking 
445030,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, 1 For us the restaurant Floor 18 was rather expensive not necessarily over priced for what was being offered For us the lounge bar which served food was a better option 2 The nearest railway metro station is a 15 min walk away and the hotel now charge 3 euros per person each way for the courtesy mini bus I am almost certain it was advertised as free when we first booked , 1 The circular tower block each bedroom is one tenth of the perimeter is an interesting design 2 Two fast lifts meant that the height 18 floors was no disadvantage 3 The lounge bar Floor 17 served good quality food better than bar snacks which was reasonably priced for the quality of the location 4 The completely transparent circular shower near the in the middle of the bedroom makes for a very spacious looking bedroom only the WC has a separate cubicle you can see why the designer went for such an unusual option 
445031,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Shower in the middle of the room was a little odd , Great hotel in the perfect location Metro to all locations with in 10 min walk Breakfast was probably the best Continental breakfast ive ever had endless choices 
445032,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The waiter in the bar was very impolite We have ordered 2 beer he threw the coaster on the table , The bathroom is very nice The bed is very comfortable 
445033,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Toilet in the corner and shower in the middle of the room is just unpractical With only two fast Food Restaurants in the near and the Hotel Restaurant not much choice of where to eat Unfortunately accept from the 2 free glasses of Sekt my Birthday Dinner was nothing special Restuarant floor was still dirty from Breakfast , Hotel personnel were super and assist us on getting to Amsterdam Center With the Metro one is in Amsterdam in 20 Minutes 
445034,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I couldn t use the hairdryer in front of a mirror no plug foreseen Tip for other travellers that want to dry their AND want to see what they are doing take the shiny plate with coffee accessories empty it put it on top of the coffee machine yes it can plug in the hair dryer and do your hair with the plate as your mirror , The view is great the shower in the middle of the room special 
445035,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, 1 The Tram station is 15 minutes walk 1 5 km from the hotel there is a shuttle to the Tram station but it goes only once every hour and costs 3 Euro person 2 The Toilet is nothing but private the Shower looks nice as a Glass tube Which is cool only if you are with someone you enjoy looking at naked Meanwhile the toilet had a wobbly door that doesn t close completely und wouldn t provide sufficient noise isolation , 1 Free Parking 2 KFC und Burger King across the street 3 Quiet 4 Breakfast was nice 5 Available Bicycles for rent 10 Euro 24 hours though the bikes aren t in good shape 6 All the rooms are non smokers but there is a smoking deck at the top floor of the hotel you can smoke your own joint there the hotel doesn t sell weed 
445036,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, This is an amzing place you won t regret to go the hotel structure is futuristic and appealing The room is supern nice and the shower gives a special touch terrace on the top was super cozy and chill all so so niceeeeeeee stylishing and chilling 
445037,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Location this hotel brings the definition in the middle of nowhere to a whole new level Food a chef that serves some undefined frozen fish but with a bite of frozen lobster along with over roasted unpeeled baby carrots and an undefined something that could be anything between a splint of driftwood and a used vanilla pod into a broth heavily polluted with cream and a cracker on the side and call this bouillabaisse is capable of anything I d suggest crossing the road and get some better food at the Burger King Cleanliness poor Carpet shower walls everything gave that feeling I do not want to touch anything here nor walk bare feet Totally unexpected I have to admit Rooms self pretentious illogical tiny uncomfortable just name it The shower cabinet in the center of the room is just a very very bad idea perhaps more suitable for one of those places that offer hourly rates plus there is not a single little surface at hand height to place your own shampoo or shower gel bottle and in order to close and open the stream of water you have to bring the selector through the Cold position which is not nice if there is no room to set aside Toilet no privacy whatsoever the enclosure does not close properly let alone locking and if you are sitting for the big thing every few minutes you must waive enthusiastically toward the movement sensor unless you want to complete the operation in the dark Sink more or less the size of a soup plate and placed at the end of the room desk mind your elbow Panoramic view of Amsterdam if you like to see how a KFC restaurant looks like from above search no further this is the hotel for ya I ve never noticed that they look like fried chicken buckets thanks Fletcher , Nothing seriously Ah no the short stay 
445038,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Like staying at a motorway service station Middle of nowhere difficult to get around from here Staff rude A hotel for business not tourists No free shuttle to the metro station 3 euros each alternatively an 18 min walk in the middle of the highway , Nothing
445039,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel is quite far from the city centre 20 mins by cab Also could not charge our phones with the adapter plug Room was clean however shower overflowed due to clogged up hair in the plug , Very clean rooms nice hotel polite staff Very quite and peaceful and had a lovely lounge at the top with brilliant views 
445040,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The room was fantastic Large sized room with all that need even a bottle of water a chocolate on your pillow Loved the decor and the shower in the middle of room View was fantastic Location was perfect short walk to the metro station 10 15 minutes If needed could use the hotel shuttle bus for 3 per person per trip Free parking and wifi were all great Loved the sky lounge bar The staff were friendly and efficient Would highly recommend to all travelers We loved it so much we came back to stay another night during our trip 
445041,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Not sure about the shower in the middle of the room Squeaky door on the toilet Stylist but too small wash basin , Great panoramic views from Sky bar and restaurant Very good staff from reception to bar and restaurant A very different modern hotel that is convenient for AMS Z O business district and with easy access to AMS Schiphol and motorway links Room was Excellent value for money Restaurant very good 
445042,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The staff was not very friendly and not very reactive when we had different problems hair dryer didn t work and it took long to get it replaced You wait sometimes very long before the elevator stops at your floor, The hotel is a little bit far from the Center of Amsterdam but if you go there with a Car it is an excellent place to stay as the parking is free of charge normally 5 per hour in Amsterdam The restaurant in the 18th floor is nice an the food is ok The quality of the bed is excellent but forget the pillow Bring you own one 
445043,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Beds sag a little in the middle bathroom light sometimes switches on automatically No water cooker tea No fridge , Great location great rooms nice atmosphere fantastic staff
445044,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The view and the rooms are starting to get old Paint coming off Showerdoor was leaking so we had a wet floor All bottels shampoo handwash where open not closed after refilling , The price is to high The hotel is nice but not so special as we thought We had a room at the backside of the hotel So our view was very poor For this price we know better hotels We are used to these prices and know what you can have for this price The rooms are missing a final special thing 
445045,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Location not the best outside the City Need a car, Very good Food in the Restaurant Tomato soup was very good The ceasar salad was spectacular As con quite high prices as well 
445046,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The hand held part of the shower did not work The mattress was very very thin and it should be a double bed not two singles pushed together The room was cold and the heating did not work The sink was a bad design and water went everywhere , The shower was a nice feature
445047,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff were friendly and helpful There is a lake to the front of the hotel which was beautiful for my partner and myself to enjoy a run while we were staying in Amsterdam The facilities are just as they are advertised We enjoyed our trip and will be returning again 
445048,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, When i stayed first time in this hotel was fitness room before you need came back fitness room i prefer to stay in hotels with fitness room and i like to use its and location without car not comfortable i stayed 2 times without car and this time with rent a car , I came back to this hotel again i like this hotel I like design beautiful bar and restaurant 
445049,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, So first of all there was the really undfriendly receptionist There was no Hello no description how we us the elevator how we get to our room and how we us your room card she didn t gave us another card I mean I could asked for one but after that unfriednly welcome I didn t wanna talk anymore to here So after that she didn t ask us for breakfast so I think the stuff of this hotel don t wanna make any money I know that I could ask for anything but it isn t my job though The room was okay I mean for that money I don t aspekt more There was a lot of stuff that have to be fixed like some damage on the wall and doors or the collor was off in the room and the hallway , The design was pretty cool 
445050,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, This hotel is very close to the metro and there is a free chuttle bus from the hotel which can take you there and pick you up Although I was not at this hotel to sight see this hotel is very modern and clean and the reception staff were very helpful and friendly and assisted me throughout my stay
445051,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Location was slightly out however well worth it Food next to you if needed Shuttle bus from hotel was handy however stopped early Need to get shuttle or walk 10 mins to the station to get a metro into the center But aside from that we ll worth it Once you know what ones to get it s a breeze, Absolutely amazing hotel stylish and comfortable Everything from your toiletries hairdryer safe all included without fee The website not only didn t false advertise anything we were impressed beyond expectations despite having looked it up It was cleaned daily Friendly staff located next to burger King and KFC 
445052,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, We knew the hotel was a little way out from Amsterdam central and thought it wouldn t matter but the journey in and out of town was just a little too far The hotel location is in a commercial area with no local amenities or bars only fast food restaurants , The hotel itself was excellent an unusual but wonderful design with first Class views all around from the rooms and bar The staff kept us supplied with water and always asked if we needed anything The shower capsule was everything we hoped for The shuttle service to the station was handy too 
445053,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, When first checking in we got charged 20 euros business tax which was abit of a shock The cleanliness of the room was not the best the sink had toothpaste mark from previous person the bedding wasn t changed during our stay and the coffee machine had a used coffee pod in I would not say it is a 4 star hotel no more needs abit of work to the rooms And our last night a alarm woke us up at 4 30am in the morning , The look of the hotel was modern Not to back from the metro abit of a walk but you could use the shuttle service but half way through our holiday they wanted to charge 3euro per person each way The Breakfast was very nice and the shower was pretty kool
445054,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The room was not clean and the wc was very dirty The idea of the shower in the center of the room was not ideal The dinner was expensive The price of the room was high for the available facilities , The food was excellent and the service in the restaurant was good

445057,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, you cannot get the invoice the day before if you leave early in the morning There was a fire alarm at 4 24 AM because a shOle was smoking in a non smoking room , the view
445058,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Location especially due to bad weather would be fine walking 10 mins to the metro in summer Bit pricey perhaps, Really comfy bed best nap ever didn t want to leave
445059,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Check in too late arrived at the hotel in the morning and had to wait till 3pm to check in we requested a double bed with a view and ended up with 2 single beds pushed together with single quilts , The restaurant and bar were nice with a good choice of food and drink The staff were also very friendlyand helpful in the restaurant 
445060,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Booking com unfornutely did not transmit the fact that we come with our child we paid for him too 3 persons as a result no king queen size bed was provided hotel is really on the subburb we knew in advance there is a need to take metro or to go by car to the city centre unfortunately we faced a technical problem nonstop light coming from toilet to the room over the night toilet is in the room divided only by darkened glass no sewing kit in the room coffee machine not allowing to prepare the tea, very interesting hotel with marvelous design glass shower enclosure in the middle of the room shuttle between hotel and metro station both hotel and room were very clean hotel restaurant with live DJ on Saturday high quality breakfast with wide range of products sparkling wine on Sunday
445061,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I am now back from my trip from Amsterdam I think there should be a few more points made on the summary so that people have a real idea what they are booking Firstly from the airport to the hotel was 70 euro in a taxi It takes 25 30 mins by car to get to the centre and we were 30 40 euros each way you had said it was only 15 mins I also found the receptionist really unhelpful and rude They didn t make us feel welcome at all We called room service for 2 sprites they came with small glasses 20 mins after we called Also it was our boyfriends birthday so we were celebrating in the room with some processco so we called for a bucket of ice and 2 glasses After 30 mins of waiting for the ice and glasses to arrive they didn t So we had to call them again 15 mins again of waiting they finally came to our door not even an apology for taking 45 mins to bring a bucket of ice and 2 glasses Which is absolutely ridiculous for a 4 star hotel , Over all the hotel was absolutely beautiful 
445062,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Found a dead mouse under the bed and the odour was so strong I don t Understand how the cleaners could not smell it as soon as I entered the room I got a bad smell and went to report it , Found a dead mouse 
445063,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The coldness or the rooms staffs attitudes no direct information of facilities or restaurant times so we didnt av food or breakfast once We found ourselfs eatin out every time Which cost alot more We complained of cold room and wasn t offered any extra warmth etc Heater or blankets We wasnt told we had to book shuttle 2 hour in advance so wasnt happy we had to pay 50 for taxi to airport also no menu for restaurant you have to view online which isnt easy to access overall it made what was ment to be a good birthday for my partner a bad experience and miserable moments , The style or the room and hotel very nicely decorated too
445064,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Impractical room facilities special no privacy on full glass shower right in middle of room unfortunately our room heating system wasn t working , Shape of building and free parking
445065,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Building and rooms showing signs of wear and tear in places which is a shame Couldn t help but notice some of the marks on the circular corridor walls match the dimensions of the housekeeping trollies , Building and rooms are unique and interesting first noticed this building from an aeroplane window There s the prospect of having a nice view from your room due to the building s relative height to the surrounds Easy free parking access to the room was rapid with modern speedy elevators Nearby drive through restaurants if KFC piques your interest over the in house fine dining Customer service staff were flawless 
445066,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The location is somewhat off though makes up it for an uncommon view Metro to the centre is a 10 minutes walk or shuttle service away , I loved the room and the sky lounge It has a very different flavour Love the shower Free coffee and water bottles appreciated 
445067,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The bill was absolutely not correct unfortunately my wife did not check it and there was a bar bill and breakfast to be paid that we haven t had I do not come back here ,No Positive
445068,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The shower in the middle of the room is fun for couples but for prude teenaged brothers and sisters its a hassle It would be great if there were a choice but apparently all rooms are the same , The views from the rooms and restaurant are spectacular The food in the restaurant was excellent Staff was very friendly and knowledgable and went out of their way to make us feel welcome 
445069,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, We didnt liked the room service food it could be a lot better plus i think a mini bar would be pleasant as well , I liked the architecture of the building
445070,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Without a car you will find the hotel rather difficult to get too and its far from the main city , Shower and included facilities were clean and pratical 
445071,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, No kettle Had to wait for room service every time I wanted tea Water was like warm probably hot tap Bar very slow Over cooked food or undercooked chicken I was ill Towels not soft at all Issue being dealt with my co set manager Check your bar bills Understaffed very slow in bar on 17th floor Moody staff except Arbana chef Michael and wonderful Shasihra chef barista , Comfy beds Lovely views Very clean Quiet housekeeping Safe easy to use Shuttle every 30 mins efficient Devine toiletries Lovely organic apples in reception Good wifi Arbana Michael Shasihsa 
445072,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Is too far of next metro station I had to walk 30 min to came back there the shuttle service only work often of 30 min only till 22h30 I had to back before it to avoid lost the last one , This hotel is near of good restaurants excellent service the room was amazing so comfortable But I recommend there if you have a car or your own transportation 
445073,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Cold rooms bad internet connection bad location even if you have a car No room service after 23 00 a bottle of water 9 50 euro Isn t expensive a tip for internet users and staff if you use special DNS number for connection you should remove setup as default and than try connect to internet , Friendly staff
445074,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Several things are stylish and trendy looking but not very functional the sink in the room is curved and low at one side so water splashes out over the side the shower echoes the shape of the hotel a bizarre glass tube in the middle of the room which may not sit well with business travelers sharing a room or others uncomfortable with displaying their body the plates at breakfast were an oval shape on a raised base but they tilt when you cut something with knife and fork the coffee table in the room had a very small round base with a big round top so that it continually threatened to topple over and smash the huge round window facing over the highway , Finally my little girl s dream came true to stay in the Bubble Hotel Beautiful hotel from the outside with a swish modern interior and the view from inside is excellent Our room was overlooking the freeways interesting to see the cars racing way below Staff are friendly rooms are clean Parking is free Breakfast is not bad 16 Location is not close to trains or trams but handy to a group of fast food restaurants across the road Burger King KFC Pizza Pasta and Wok There is a big lake across the highway via a bike path bridge which is quite a nice walk with lots of birds No extra charge for a 7 year old and free breakfast for her which was nice of the man in charge at breakfast 
445075,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Because of its location it was quite expensive to get to from the airport Also was a little bit far out from the centre However part of the appeal was it elevated views in the open environment District , Great futuristic aspect with a particularly spectacular elevated and stylish bar on the 17th floor staff were friendly and helpful plus there was a useful shuttle service to the nearest train station 
445076,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, 1 The cabinets with extra futons are dusty 2 I lost my Bosch electric kettle in Room 407 but the staff denied when I called to ask How lucky I used to be when the NH hotel actively called me they found my Louis Vuitton wallet 3 Poorly sealed bathroom will leak much water on the floor 4 The front desk staff tried to charge me city tax twice so that we had to argue for more than 30 minutes when we checked out 5 No kingsize bed , The design is kind of interesting and free parking
445077,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I didn t care for the weather because it rained but I was able to take the train to town and back to my room before it started Can t change the weather , The views from my 10th floor room and that beautiful shower in the middle of my room were my favorites 
445078,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing it suited everything we needed, The hotel room was amazing the shower in the middle of the room was a nice modern twist although quite a bit out of the centre the train system was fantastic and it is only a 10 minute walk to the hotel from holendrecht station so well worth staying there as train ride only 15 mins to centre
445079,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Round glass shower in the middle of the room difficult to regulate temperature Toilet is not soundproof because glass doors do not close entirely Not very pleasant for fellow travellers in the same room , The view from the top floor while having breakfast the comfortable bed 
445080,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Shower doesn t have full instructions regarding warm water there are not indicators regarding the temperature After try and error ouch you can figure it out , Nice hotel friendly staff special shower nice view nice restaurant 
445081,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I don t like the shower in the bedroom And it takes up a lot of space , Breakfast was okay and the croissants and the chocolate ones were delicious
445082,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Small room There is no minibar no tissues napkins The toilet is a cabin with no sonor isolation Location 10mn to the metro station and the hotel is in an empty area , Parking
445083,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Sheets where not clean the rest of the room was clean No communication about the shuttle service when how to communicate , Nice location nice view from the restaurant and bar Nice rooms Nice view from rooms Xllnt break first Lot of parking locations easy depart and arrival less traffic than city center Shuttle to the metro on appointment pickup is a bit slow 1 2 waiting time in the cold 
445084,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, It took ages to get register at the reception desk even if I am already in the system as it is not my first stay at fletcher AMS The lady at the reception called me at 23 30 to ask me to confirm my wake up call The shower was leaking into the room , Location
445085,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I did not like the staff from the reception specially during the night shift I have worked in a hotel before as a receptionist and customer service was always 1st We phoned the reception twice for champagne glasses and a charger and they took more than 20 minutes to bring such as simple things or if we phone them back asking for it again they would suggest us to come downstairs to get it as they were really busy something that should never happen Also when we used to ask for something at the reception the night receptionists wouldn t even look into our eyes like we re not there However when we got there we wasn t even told about any information at all e g facilities Customer service was really poor I would expect better for the money that I ve paid , I liked the fact that we had transport to the station but the waiting for it was confusing regarding the fact that we was told different times every single time The bed was really comfortable 
445086,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, There were not enough pillows on the beds and the spare pillows in the cupboard were dirty full of makeup The shower and wash basin were stylish but a lot of water came out of the shower when getting in and a lot of water splashed out of the wash basin due to the shape Also when booking the hotel I had requested a large double bed but was given two single beds pushed together instead , The hotel was very beautiful modern and stylish
445087,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, First of all I would like to start off by saying when we arrived I was instantly upset as me and my partner couldn t walk in the rotating door together as it was too small for two people to fit into the cubical I m very shocked that the shower was in the middle of the room I assumed that it was just advertisement and they would have normal bathrooms but apparently not This really made me feel uncomfortable as I had to shower in front of my partner and we have never seen each other naked before When I eventually plucked up the courage to have a shower I then discovered that there was no where to place my towel for as soon as I got out I had to walk a few steps to reach my towel and by this point I had become very very cold My partner then used the toilet and I was disgusted to hear what he was doing in there I just cannot believe that the hotel don t supply ear plugs We then made our way into Amsterdam even though it quite clearly says how far it is from the town and we had to get a train I just can t believe they would even build a hotel more than 15 minutes away from the centre I also feel like I need to blame the hotel for the smell of marijuana in the city as I have no one else to blame for that As I got a headache from the smell I decided it was best to go back to my round room and go to bed I have never in my life slept through the night I m disgusted that the hotel has such comfy beds and I managed to get a full nights sleep Crazy We payed extra for a champagne breakfast well if you can even call it that we had to ASK for the champagne I am annoyed it wasn t waiting by the door for me on a silver tray as I walked into the room The cooked breakfast left me feeling very upset as the grilled tomatoes were cut in half and not quarters which meant I had to use the muscles in my arms to cut them up smaller ,No Positive
445088,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The staff in the bar aren t very attentive We waited for a very long time on both occasions that we tried to order drinks It was almost as if you were invisible Very strange considering the reception staff are so helpful , Very different hotel as it s circular We were on the 12th floor so had great views and views were good from the bar and restaurant 
445089,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I told them that it was my birthday day and that was the mean reason I went there but they didn t do anything about it so I was disappointed , The room was very nice and somehow sensual 
445090,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Not a lot to do in the evenings , Perfect location by the A2 for business Rooms are still quiet The unusual room layout means this isn t just another bed factory Free Parking Free Wifi Good restaurant 
445091,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Lack of fridge would be good idea to have an instructions how to use coffee maker and if its possible to add another luggage rack I had to use the desk to put my suitcase or I had to use the floor , The shower in the middle of the room the safe and very comfortable bed The coffee mashine is great idea Free parking and free wifi 
445092,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The cleanliness wasn t great the beds were not made nicely and the inside of the bathroom wasn t very clean, The young man that works in the restaurant at breakfast knew i came back a couple days later and got specially lactose free milk for me the rest of the staff was also very nice and in general it was a nice stay
445093,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Toilet is integrated with the room so you do not feel really privately when using the water closet , Helpful staff nice view and comfort Location could have been better but on the other hand the hotel is located close to metro station with free hotel bus 
445094,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Only bad thing about the hotel was the food I didn t think there was much choice and wasn t the best but everything else was great, Hotel was great rooms were cosy and clean beds were comfortable Bar was great and the staff were very friendly Wasn t too far from the city centre metro is a 5minute walk then get the metro straight into central 
445095,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Even though the shuttle bus was great it would make more sense to go when there were people waiting as they go every half hour We had just missed one and we had to wait with them in reception for half an hour , The beds were super comfy and loved the unique room The location is slightly out of the city but the staff were great at providing the free shuttle service to the station you just call and they collect you too 
445096,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Being charged twice Loosing money when they took payment twice debit card fees and exchange rate Having to pay tax when leaving the hotel , The bed was soft
445097,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The abscence of a minibar in my room , The artistic desighn of the Hotel and all its facilities Also the staff were highly professional and very helpful 
445098,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Small space transparent shower in the middle of the room not kidding in the middle of nowhere 15 min to metro , Clean rooms nice view from the restaurant 
445099,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Conditioning in the room wasn t perfect needed to leave a second card in while being out for conditioner to warm up and to get a comfortable temperature in the room, Very original place to stay I would say inspiring for romantic stay Great view friendly staff and great breakfast buffet Shower tube in lux room is very nice perfect for couples to spend nice time together
445100,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing really , For us since we wanted to go to the Ziggo Dome the location was perfect We took our bikes and it s less than a 10min bike ride to the Arena square I think they also offer a shuttle bus service Obviously the hotel tower looks attractive especially at night with the blue color The rooms are special with a circle shower in the middle of the room We got free welcome drinks which we enjoyed in the lounge bar on the 17th floor with a very nice view 
445101,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The location is a bit far from town though free bus to the metro was convenient and the train only took 15 mins to get into town , The rooms were nice and clean and a little different Excellent views and bar prices were very reasonable also an Italian Chinese and burger king located over the road 
445102,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Zombie Staff No Hi no Smile when checking in except when checking out The shower was not easy to use with no privacy no curtain Mattress was too soft for me 85kg No fridge Ordered 1 big bed got a 2 bed room instead, free parking Wifi TV Compulsary water coffee Nice view from hotel
445103,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Cold room that you cannot warm up as temperature goes up to 24C on the A C but never reaches it Arrogant receptionist at check in instead of a double bed there were two single ones stuck together with two different single duvets No mini bar at the room and you could listen to the water from other rooms when people showering like they were in your room , Nice parking nothing else
445104,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel is perhaps too far away from city centre for tourists Staff were pleasant enough but came over as uninterested , Room excellent comfortable clean and quirky 
445105,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, It was a bit cold in the room despite my efforts to increase the air temperature but I like when it is really warm The hotel was in a very convinient location for me yet it is quite far from the center you need 15 min to walk to the metro station , A very very nice hotel The design is great rooms are perfect and the personnel is really helpful Breakfest satisfying I like the concept that the shower cabin in the middle of bedroom yet I can imagine that such a room would be chosen only by couples or singles 
445106,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Let me start by saying the staff one in particular was the rudest I have ever come across at any stay at any Hotel in any country Desiree at reception would shout at us laugh at us and tell us that she will do things her own way and not the hotels way She even cancelled our room cards twice just to cause us inconvenience She is letting the hotel down immensely The hotel needs new management urgently I would not recommend this hotel at all , The building looks beautiful from the outside and it is a very iconic structure
445107,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The scramble eggs were overcooked witout any taste and like they were cooked three days ago The bacon was extremely greasy Come on guy s baking eggs and bacon is basic Advise to other travellers go to McDonalds 400 meters further your breakfast will be better then at Fletcher at 1 3 op the price , Stunning view from the tower unique place to stay 
445108,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The bed is really bad Mattress is thinner than my hair and you can t sleep in the middle of the bed unless you want to wake up feeling pain all over your body , One of the best hotel staff I ve ever seen From the security to the reception very good and polite people
445109,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The beds are really not good for couples They have two single beds that have a massive gap between them so you can t spoon, Everything was perfect apart from the beds 
445110,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The room has literally no bathroom Instead the shower is in the middle of the room and the sink is at the left side of the working desk You don t have any privacy if you re not the only one in the room Only the toilet is separated by a tiny milky glass wall , Very friendly staff everywhere in the hotel Front Desk Bar it s just a 15 minute walk to a train metro station that links directly to the city centre free shuttle bus runs every 30 minutes from hotel to metro station free welcome drink modern rooms quiet rooms free parking
445111,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Way to far away from the city centre unfortunately It took us a long hour and a half on a bike and cost us a whooping 66 taxi return , Beautiful hotel lovely kind staff really helpful and friendly Very comfy bed 
445112,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Watch out for the complimentary drink only a few things are valid and we ordered something different but the bartender didn t tell us it wasn t included in the offer and we ended up having to pay for it , Everything was great but 
445113,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I was checking out at 6 45 and breakfast wasn t available until 7 00 so I asked for a takeaway breakfast But when i checked out I wasn t given anything ,No Positive
445114,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Kitchen and restaurant always seemed overwhelmed Quite nice people but they were often mixing up orders My vegan friend got a real hamburger instead of the fake one Maybe they were not with enough people Also it was not super clean in the main areas I saw quite some spiderwebs and it was a bit dusty The room itself was very clean though The overall concept is good but it just didnt fully work out , Cool and artsy
445115,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Improved transport to the hotel yes there is a shuttle but we were not advised how often it runs or if it was demand only We caught it twice going to the station but walked to the hotel on arrival at night and walked back again after a day out , Beautiful hotel room restaurant and bar a little pricey but you do get what you pay for 
445116,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The kettle was not working the tv holder was broken and there was no liquid soap I think it was too many oversights for 4 star property , The decor was interesting The sky bar is definitely worth a visit 
445117,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I requested a double but got a room with two single beds I was that tired when I arrived that I didn t bother raising it Well I wish I had as it was sadly the worst two nights sleep I ve had in a long while as I just couldn t get comfortable at all The menu could do with some more range and the Lounge Bar Menu could do with offering better value for money , The view was nice and if you go across the small bridge alongside the hotel it takes you to a lovely large lake Great for a walk or a nightly run around the lake About 4km each lap The food was nice if expensive Couldn t hear the road at all from inside the hotel which is pretty impressive 
445118,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, 2 single beds while I ve asked for single double bed I don t understand why the single big bed is not the standard in Netherlands alone or with our love big bed is far better water temperature adjustment where you need to come from cold to find the good temperature each time you cut the water Why is there is no thermostatic adjustment , design of the building bar bedroom restaurant comfort breakfast Dishes in the restaurant very good an original Price very good when using web booking company and reserve in advance This was a great experience changing from standard setup fit out I will come back with my wife 
445119,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The shower enclosure leaked slightly make sure you close it Also don t turn the sink on fast it splashes out Common sense on both points nothing major However the location wasn t very good it took about 45 mins from leaving the hotel to getting into the city centre on public transport , The room the design The bar The rooftop terrace 
445120,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Of course being closer to the city center would have been nice but as real estate prices are high this hotel found a way to make visiting Amsterdam a possibility for those wanting to keep hotel prices reasonable Getting a train ticket was a bit of a challenge at the metro in trying to figure out which ticket was needed to get us back and forth to the hotel pickup It would have been perfect if the hotel could sell those tickets for tourist on their own , The Fletcher Hotel was a gift in many ways although it is not close to the city center Inside the center hotels prices were outrageous and this one was reasonable This hotel went out of their way to make getting into the center easy by providing a transport to the metro station which we used The sphere shaped hotel and round round glass shower in the middle of the room were definitely a novelty and added spice to the stay It seemed to have a nice restaurant although we did not use it We would stay there again We also appreciated the free covered parking Receptionists were accommodating 
445121,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Shower was hard to handle not very smooth It s such a shame for that glass bathroom , Room design was interesting and different from usual hotel rooms Staff helped me with a few things which was kind Driver also helped to show me nearest ATM 
445122,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, No fridge in room so i cannot buy something fresh back to ny family My boyfriens love coffee he said coffee nice but i drink tea i hope one tea for me sure nice I want small size of bicycle because i am not tall people so Big bike make me difficult to ride around city, Position not far from metro and supermarket Cleanliness in room and around hotel Free parking and wi fi
445123,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The pillows is so high this is my only dislike, Every thing was good the staff the location the cleanliness but for me and for my wife the challenges was with the pillows they have only high pilow and not in the middle that what made our night uncomfortable 
445124,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I initially booked for 2 nights but I got my wallet phone cash and all of my bank cards stolen on the 2nd night I believe I had been drugged by someone with an hipnotic as the entire night was a blank and I was still having blackouts the next afternoon The police took me back to the hotel and as I had missed my flight and was in no condition to travel I asked to stay a little longer The hotel insisted that I rang my wife at home and got her to email copy passport copy credit card etc or they were going to throw me out on the street penniless I am registered disabled by the way as I have difficulties moving both arms holding things walking more than 200 yards or so and I m due to have an operation next week to try to reduce the pain Some people assume wrongly that it is alcohol or drug related The hotel repeatedly told my wife that the theft was our problem not their s and the lady called Helen made it clear that she would have thrown me out if she d been working that day They had my wife in tears on more than one ocassion and I wouldn t recommend the Hotel to anyone In addition the design is terribble as there is nowhere for the condensation from the shower etc to go and everything was always wet water under the kettle my laptop my mouse I was always cold as the heating didn t work and the breakfast was very expensive and of poor quality , Looks nice from the outside and some of the reception staff are very nice Elizabeth and the grey haired gentleman who does the night shift Handy KFC Burger KIng over the road 
445125,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The personal in the bar was terrible They have a limited cartell of cocktails and they are not capable to accept simple request such as long drink Also we have an incident with some pepole partying in the bar with a extremely high music volume and the personal was not capable to ask the DJ to reduce the volume So we left the hotel with a terrible impression of the staff , The design is impressive and the beds really confortable 
445126,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Pillows had stains on blood phoned for clean ones they arrived also stained The toilet roll holder in the room was broken The iron and ironing board had something purple stuck to it and it ruined my partners white shirt I had stayed at the hotel before and although I knew the veiws were not the best I did not realise that one side of the buliding overlooked a youth correction facility That was not the best thing to be looking at on a romantic weekend away The sockets in the room were also ridiculously placed as I could not use my hair dryer straighteners whilst using the mirror The sink also as unique as it is was very impractical, Food lovely staff helpful and polite shuttle bus very useful Modern and present rooms
445127,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Brilliant staff so friendly We put our do not disturb on the door every day an took it off when we went out and the maid still cleaned the room The room was spotless had some english channels too which was a bonus Great view aswell 10minute walk from a connection train to amsterdam central station My advice use the train to get to the hotel from airport as the taxi there was 51 No shops around the hotel so if you need anything grab it in the town REALLY NICE ALL ROUND THANK YOU 
445128,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The shower was leaking badly so the carpet was all the time wet There was no place for the soap shower gel sponge etc inside the shower tube we put them on the floor of the shower The sink was also leaking because of the position and the table was full with water The position of the towel is strange and unusable No ear sticks or a fridge The bed sheets were never changed for 7 days 1 wall was full with dust We had to wait for the shuttle bus more than 15 min to pick us up from the metro station two times and in the last day we waited more than 30 min But they d never wait for us if we were late not even2min And if you miss the shuttle bus which is every half an hour you have to walk 13min It s all ok except for the nightime cause the shuttle bus is working until 11pm and we always wanted to stay late in amsterdam And it s far from the city center like 40min Now we knew that we don t have a fridge and that it s far from amsterdam s center but giving the fact that there were other problems and that the hotel is 4stars we had to mention all of it It s futuristic and different and good job for the idea but it has lots to work on to actually be a 4stars hotel , The view from our room was pretty nice even though you can see the highway There is a nice lake behind the hotel where you can take a swim during summer We had 2 glasses of champagne from the house and they have waited us with plastic roses petals on the bed cause we told them it s our honeymoon We could do the check in 1 hour earlier than usual We asked for ironing board and they bring it in 5 min The ideea with the shower tube in the middle of the room is nice but because of this you will find a lot of minuses 
445129,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The fact that in booking com it was stated that no deposit was going to be charged the hotel reserved a great amount of our credit card and caused us problems since at the arrival time their policy was to charge the whole amount The hotel was not clean the room floor was never cleaned during our stay and the same goes for the glass shower The rooms didnt have a window and it was very hot The temp in our room never fell from 26 degrees The staff doing the shifts after midnight is inexperienced it seems that they are not working for the hotel but for another company offering services to the hotel this is what we were told from the morning shift staff Well these were the people who caused us the problem with our credit card It was in total an experience which we didnt let it ruin our holidays For sure though we wouldnt stay there again , the design of the hotel was excellent Since we were travelling by car the location was perfect other than that if you want to enjoy Amsterdam you should stay closer to the town The location of this hotel was 20 min by train Their room service was great 
445130,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, It s just the location for me really as we went to visit Amsterdam but it was a 15 minute walk to the metro then a 15 minute train ride but in all fairness the hotel do put a shuttle service on to the metro, The hotel itself was absolutely beautiful staff were friendly and the bar resteraunt was lovely The rooms were also great they were really clean and look to have just been redone so we were really happy with the room 
445131,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, the rooms should have a fridge the bathroom in the middle of the hotel is only ideal for couples but not two individuals who are just friends some sockets and lights werent working in my room the towels in the room were not changed after the first night, the staff were very kind i could store my luggage till i checked in
445132,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I didn t like u couldn t get any sort of drink from bar after 1 like every hotel has after hours services than when at door staff looking at I screaming it s closed also the beds kept coming apart and staff Were not friendly for us paying nearly a 1000euro that would have been more helpful instead of looking at u with ten heads, I like the look of the hotel rooms are nice
445133,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Parking is expensive unless you can score one on the street , bar staff were excellent and the location is the best Plenty of places to eat nearby Beds were comfy and the aircon worked well Free internet was not fast but worked ok Enjoyed my stay 
445134,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Quite far from the city travelling everyday was a nuisance, Lovely hotel staff were very friendly and willing to help if needed Room was unusual but stunning Enjoyed my stay for the weekend 
445135,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, It was a bit further out that expected from Amsterdam some of the staff were a bit weird some staff could work on there people skills but other staff were great , I loved the comfy bed in the room I stayed in and also the bar restaurant on the top floor was awesome great views the hotel quiet which was great for staying in bed late after a night out in Amsterdam The room was cheap and great for value 
445136,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, You can t open the window everything depends on the working air conditioner The room was pretty dusty there was some garbage lying on the floor when I came in first so it should be cleaned with more care There s neither a mini bar in the room nor a drinks dispenser anywhere inside the hotel to get cold soft drinks like coke lemonade from so you have to stick to the hotel bar restaurant s opening hours The shuttle service works though you should not be in a hurry but calculate with long times to wait I told the hotel 10 minutes before I got to the station that I need the shuttle in 10 minutes they told me to be there but when I arrived at the station they weren t After waiting about 10 minutes I rang the hotel again to ask for the shuttle and was told it would be there in some minutes another 10 minutes later the shuttle finally arrived and the driver told us to again wait for some minutes as he was expecting some other people After 10 more minutes the shuttle finally started driving back So I had to wait 30 minutes for the shuttle to drive me to the hotel though I had called to arrange it on time If I had known that before I d rather have walked the 15 minutes to the hotel On top of that I had the feeling to not be welcome the staff at the main desc tended to just ignore me and gave me the feeling I was disturbing them though I really didn t ask for much and was very friendly the whole time They treated me like they were forced to as it was their job That was making me feel uncomfortable the whole time so I can t recommend this hotel as a place to feel well and enjoy your time , Very stylish and modern architecture from the outside from the inside Decent 32 inch TV with TV channels from the Netherlands and abroad Nice view out of the window Cool experience to stay at Fletchers just because of the style but indeed style is not everything it s the inside values that count so read the negative section and you know why I won t return to Fletcher 
445137,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast very nice But not included in the price Maybe I made a misstake while booking So we paid apart But usually breakfast always included However I would come back , Very modern hotel with excellent breakfast The rooms are clean and modern The Fletcher is good located a bit outside Amsterdam By car Amsterdam is to reach in 20 min 
445138,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Location a little far out but the hotel does have a shuttle bus to train station nearby and very easy journey into Amsterdam city , Sky bar lovely friendly staff Design really unusual
445139,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, It is a bit far from the centre but perfect if you re attending a music event in the concert halls nearby , The place is futuristic with a unique shower in the middle of the room great view and comfy bed The food in restaurant is also nice 
445140,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The shower flooded Preference on the kind of beds was ignored , The hotel has an original design The location is not served by urban transportation but the hotel offers a complimentary shuttle service every 30 minutes to reach the closest metro station around 1 5 km Very good complimentary coffee in the room 
445141,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, It would ve been nice to have the towels replaced when the rooms were freshened up during our stay Also we tried to arrange a taxi back after seeing Beyonc in concert only to be told that that wouldn t be possible We then struggled to find a taxi that would pick us up We called for the shuttle to collect us from the metro station back to the hotel at night were told 30mins However after 45mins it still hasn t arrived and we had to call back to question what was going on Eventually the shuttle came but no apologies , The room was very spacious compared to other double rooms in Amsterdam hotels The beds were extremely comfortable but the mattress does tend to slide about As long as you are comfortable being naked around whoever you are sharing a room with the shower is good The hotel has a free shuttle to metro station which is helpful and they can also arrange a taxi service for wherever else you need to go The bar restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the staff are friendly As I only stayed here because the location was close to the Amsterdam Arena I m not sure if I would stay again but I would recommend it to others A taxi from the airport cost us around 50
445142,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Cilinder shower no real bathroom squeeling door to the toilet mattrass too soft, Clean hotel good breakfast quiet good for a business meeting boardroom 
445143,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Great staff nothing to much trouble early check in was spot on thanks for the hospitality 5 stars And thank you for the trouble in finding me a pizza at 1 30am amazing team 
445144,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The hotel is very beautiful clean nice staff really special nice rooms very nice shower very comfortable beds free parking well located Just make sur if you want to go clubbing that you find an alternative because subway is only running till midnight and doesn t start before 7h30 am in the weekend 
445145,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The view from the room was a bit disappointing KFC and Burger King The food in the restaurant was less than I expected and although the waiters were very friendly the service was not good I would suggest a more disciplined management and better coordinated service for the class of restaurant it pretends to be We had 4 5 different waiters and we had to repeat same issues several times which were not brought at the end Views were amazing , The hotel has a good price quality and is not too far from the center by train or bus Only few restaurants around A pity there is no shuttle to go to the Arena area which has more choice but it is reachable by public transport The staff in the hotel and restaurant are very friendly and helpful 
445146,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, This is perfect for a romantic sexy getaway The shower in the middle of the room is so nice Very good bed too The breakfast is amazing with sparkling wine and all Excellent hotel 
445147,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Lots of malfunctions The electricity was falling out in sections When mentioned took several complaints before someone came to take a look The problem could not be solved because there was no one from the maintenance department present We had to move in the middle of the night to another room Which was not up to standard When having a shower the water could not be drained so the floor got wet , The bar and restaurant The room looked nice 
445148,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The location is really bad so far from anything There was a shuttle advertised to the metro but no information was ever given about this so we didn t bother to ask and just walked instead Weirdly the view from the hotel was meant to be one of the best in Amsterdam or something but really is just a view over the local industrial estate and motorway Even at night it s pretty terrible , The bed was really comfy and the blackout blind meant we had a really great sleep particularly for my partner who is usually a terrible sleeper Staff were friendly and prices reasonable in the bar I thought the hotel itself was pretty good value for money overall 
445149,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I Felt the advertised pictures were misleading the rooms and the communal areas looked nothing like what I had seen online I was very disappointed with the bed in particular we had two single beds pushed together with single bedding sheets which wasn t good for a romantic getaway as everytime I rolled over to be closer to my significant other I found myself on a fairly dusty floor wedged between two very thin mattresses complete with foam toppers really did not meet my expectations by any stretch of the imagination One of my main reasons for visiting the hotel was the shower It looked different and was something I really wanted to experience however I was met with further disappointment as the shower was only partially operational for the duration of my visit The facilities were lacking in the room and in the hotel itself TV was broken towels were greyed rather than white and worn which made them feel unhygienic There is no mini fridge in the room meaning no easy access to cold drinks or refreshments The hotel does not keep basic items such as plug socket adapters at the reception desk which is something I have found in even the most basic of hotels There is a shuttle service that takes you to the tram station which is literally a pleasant 10 minute stroll along a pretty stream the small minibus type vehicle that runs every 30 mins was not capable of transporting all guests to the station as the amount of people waiting for it outweighed the amount of seats available All in all I was very disappointed with the hotel and would be very reluctant to visit again or to recommend the hotel to anybody I have visited Amsterdam over 20 times and this has to be the most disappointing experienced I have had with regards to accommodation especially considering the price I payed , I liked the design of the hotel it was different and quirky hence why I booked The smoking area was nice 
445150,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Interesting design in the rooms A bit wacky Great sky bar with lovely staff Shuttle bus was very handy Although a little way out easy to get into the centre of Amsterdam by train Free welcome drink
445151,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Shuttle service runs only until 10 30 pm from closest train station that is over mile away and u also have to call them which can be impossible or very expensive for international visitors No true amenities like spa or sauna just bar and restaurant Location is good 20mins train ride from central station Not able to enjoy late night Amsterdam without incuring 100 euro charges on taxi rides bc it is so far away AC doesnt really work at least not in our room , View from the room that we had on 14th floor was great as well as from bar on 18th floor Drinks are very reasonably priced Stuff is friendly Shower in the middle of the room was a fun feature Hotel from outside looks great 
445152,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Warning Only for couples do not book if you are traveling with a friend or relative No privacy at all and I am not even talking about the glass shower in the middle of the room Toilet door can t close completely and white wall of the toilet is quite see through Room was not as clean as you would expect from a 4 hotel Beds were comfortable but it s not a double bed as advertised but two singles pushed together they are moving and separating so in the morning you wake up with a big gap in between Definitely overpriced , It looks exactly like in the pictures design is very modern futuristic even but not exactly practical Hotel is easily accessible by public transportation and has good soundproofing considering it s next to the hotel Glass shower as a centar piece of the room can be interesting for one evening 
445153,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The only thing I could complain about was the materess although it was amazingly comfy they kept on sliding about which caused me to wake in the night otherwise I couldn t complain about anything , The bedroom was incredible I loved the shower especially The staff was very friendly and helpful 
445154,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, It s easy to flood the room as the shower door doesn t seal the shower cabin , Very good breakfast The hotel looks good and the staff was nice 
445155,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Very basic plug not near mirror a bit out the way but free shuttle was good was double charged when leaving still awaiting a refund Bar was pricey , The hotel was very modern but very minamalistic some time needs to be taken with house keeping seems they just threw covers back on bed bar and restaraunt was stunning
445156,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Housekeeping could have been better There weren t many vegetarian options on the menu either which was a but disappointing , The beds were comfortable and the rooms were lovely I liked the free welcome drink as well That s was a nice touch I really liked the roof top smoking area as well It was pleasantly quite as well A little out of the way from Amsterdam but the metro is within walking distance and the shuttle bus makes it even more convenient 
445157,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Layout of room was strange showe in middle of room no place to hang big towels Odd layout of room , Excellent staff free shuttle bed was the best I have slept on in a hotel 
445158,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The toiled is not soundproofed at all No welcome pack in the room so you need to call reception for every little thing like breakfast times No menu for room service in the room No plug for hair dryer close to the mirror, The shower the fact that you can rent bikes from the hotel it s a plece for couples
445159,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Bad location bad service no places around to eat There was no ability to close toilet door and it was always openned so you can see room we stayed 4 days they couldn t do anything they didn t remove trash ,No Positive
445160,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The staff tried to tell us they are double booked and booked me to another hotel without my permission and my card got charged 3 times twice to the fletcher and once to another , The hotel is nice the staff charges my card 3 times
445161,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Could have done with a wider mirror in the room just a narrow one in the corner by the sink, Coffee machine in the room made quite nice coffee we were also able to hire bikes directly from the hotel which made going to the local train station and heading in to town very easy 
445162,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The room is small and not so clean and the beddingen is having a bad smell like it s not proper dried that kind of smell We wan t to go to the bar to have a drinks but it turn out that they already closed but then we asked if we can take a look in the view there for a moment but the staff say no right away I ts a Pitty we stay there only one night for a concert of doemaar but we don t have time to see all the view of the hotel , Just the view and the restaurant they serve very delecious food so just go there for dinner or so but not stay coz it sucks 
445163,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Beautiful hotel very clean and Modern Stayed here for 2 nights at the start of June to see Chris brown at the Ziggo dome and explore Amsterdam Hotel is in a great location 10 minute drive from airport 10 minute walk to metro from metro to city centre was only 15 minutes Such easy access Staff were very pleasant and helpful during our two night stay I would highly recommend this hotel 
445164,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Location, The bed was really comfortable and the staff was great The rooms are very clean and modern Only issue is it is far from the city and concert halls 
445165,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, It is a bit far from city center although not that bothersome You do have a metro close straight to Centraal Station which is good , The rooms were unique We opted for breakfast in the room and we had such a view The restaurant is also very nice and fancy good food and great service 
445166,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I was perplexed by the age of the linen One towel and one bed sheet had holes due usage There is no doubt that they were clean just worn The cleanliness could be improved There was dust accumulation at the top of the shower It is a hard to reach area but I noticed it I also asked for a iron and ironing board the iron was in bad shape the plastic body severely cracked and missing parts the electrical cord needs to be replaced the plate had black residue I was careful and used the iron but I would definitely recommend replacing that specific iron , Location price comfort the different look and shape of the hote Great value for the breakfast and drinks I ran about 6 5 miles in the mornings in the beautiful countryside 
445167,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Well a marmite thing The shower is in the middle of the main room literally and with a glass transparent cylindrical cabin Not sure how many couples or families want this feature Thankfully the toilet is normal Quite far from the city and the metro is a decent walk away 15mins , Futuristic looking building with great views The restaurant and bar are at the top so you get the great view there too Comfy bed 
445168,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Don t know if it s booking com or the hotel who don t make you aware of the 80 euro increase of price until you come to pay That was annoying something to do with city taxes and booking fees , The rooms were very clean comfortable modern absolutely top notch The staff at the desk and everywhere else in the hotel were all very friendly and the reception were all so helpful could not rate the highly enough Also the taxi driver they called was a good lad if you use him a couple of times and you get to know him does good rates 
445169,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel offers a shuttle service to the metro station which is about 1km On a dry day it is flat and walkable We used it on a number of occasions and going from hotel works well however on returning from a concert we phoned ahead to book as requested and got confirmation that it would be there at 2315 It never arrived we kept phoning and phoning and it took forever for hotel to answer to be told its not coming This is just not acceptable no apology no nothing we asked for a taxi but that never came so we had no choice to walk by this time at midnight cold and tired I have read on TripAdvisor that we are not alone in this so beware A very helpful lady the next day did deduct our breakfast charge as goodwill which was appreciated Hotel is far out and this needs to be considered Rooms are quirky but not to everyone s taste , Beds are very comfortable and room spacious if somewhat odd in design Sky bar nice at night 
445170,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Shuttle service inconvenient an occasion in particular which the reception staff are aware off Apparently it had broken down which we were told and had to walk from the station at 11pm at night and the staff in the morning said t was completely fine Weird We called at 10 20 making sure we could get the 11oclock shuttle and we were assured yes we could But in the end it wasn t there Service with a smile would ve been nice Along with more knowledgable staff , shower Breakfast okay but expensive at 16
445171,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Very slow and unfriendly personnel at the bar at 17th floor , Great design great view from upper floors regardless prison located just in front of the hotel good breakfast 
445172,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing, Unique hotel with lots of character and a superb view Staff were friendly and helpful breakfast and dinner were excellent Could not faulty the hotel 
445173,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Hotel with great design Room was clean and spacious The shuttle bus to the underground station works very good The city centre is about 15min ride 
445174,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The shower inside the room was leaks into the room and the hotel personal couldn t fix the problem I was expected they will offer me to change room but they don t and after one hour it s start to smell bed as well, I like the parking area Modern design
445175,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The IT system always tries to charge more money authorization and payment together or in the invoice appears some additional things but the reception clear it In the room there were no soap dispensers one broken and the other didn t exist the kind staff fixed it too I was missing the in the room tea only coffee paper napkin shoe care kit, Free greetings drink Very comfortable mattresses in bed Good Dutch cuisine in the restaurant Coffee machine Senseo in the room Kind and helpful staff Free shuttle from to metro station
445176,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The bed mattress is very thin and it is two single mattresses pushed together to make a double the cheap approach One of the young guys on reception was useless booked us a taxi then gave it to someone else and lied when he said he has phoned for another one Because the showers are in the middle of the room if someone in the floor above has one at 6 am everyone gets to hear it For the price it is far too pretentious , Shower is funky but just a novelty and soon wears off Location good for AMC but nothing else Drive through KFC opposite 
445177,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I didn t like the location of it wish it was closer to the city centre unfortunately we ended up spending a lot of money just on travel to get to places as the hotel was far from the city and we did find trains very confusing , Loved the room it was gorgeous The staff were so kind the bar was fantastic Literally everything was spectacular Never seen such a lovely hotel It was an experience in itself 
445178,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, our room specifically had a toilet that was only separated by a thin not see through glass wall so as long as you are comfortable doing your morning business and listening to your guest doing theirs then its no problem obviously the layout of the room was not designed by a man , the hotel is amazing beautiful modern the staff were amazingly helpful hotel is little out of the way but the shuttle service back and forth to the metro was extremely convenient 
445179,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, shower is horrible it s unable to turn on hot water into it whatever we did with it even with help of tips on it unable to take a hot shower big big minus for 4 stars hotel coffee machine doesn t work how it should climat control doesn t work, located far from the city nice view from window design of the room
445180,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The location borders on being dodgy Room service isn t very good Towels weren t very clean Got charged a deposit larger than the cost of my stay AFTER paying for my stay , The rooms are really cool Great view Breakfast is good 
445181,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Not clean Thin toilet paper Only 2 elevators for the entire building Too far from center Expensive No hot water , The view and the bar on the top floor Very friendly staff 
445182,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Haven t noticed in advance was blinded by photos that it is far from public transport But for young couple it was not so critical , Futuristic style hotel Really cool emotions 
445183,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Would of been good to have a fan in the room other than that everything was very posh and classy and I m all over that vibe , I liked how hot the water was Usually hotels have freezing water so that made me happy The shower actually worked which also was amazing as nothing ever works in most hotels I love the fantastic layout of the hotel So smart Oh and your chips that you serve were banging Also that bus service you do to the station is so handy I think you guys deserve a 10 star for that Also one of your workers gave me and my boyfriend a lift to BURGER KING which was soooo sweet of him massive shout out to him
445184,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I did not like the fact that the room lacked a mini bar The hotel offers no spa or recreational area either It is more of a conference hotel than one for a leisure stay Finally getting there without a car is not convenient at all There is a free shuttle service to and from the nearest metro stop but one first needs to arrive at the hotel to learn about it , The hotel s restaurant is exceptional Both breakfast and dinner was served impeccably and in a lovely atmosphere The view from the top 17th floor is beautiful whether rain or shine Comfortable beds and great design From the soap to the window panes everything has a nice rounded shape 
445185,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Shower is in the midle of the room great idea but there must be at least a curtain Not very clean Expensive, Great design and conception Transfer to Metro station Friendly personnel 
445186,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I didnt like the fact i couldnt connect to the wifi via my Mac Book and no member on staff was trained in IT to assit forcing me to change hotel to the W , I like the location of the hotel and the ambiance the piano playing during lunch was a classy touch 
445187,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Shower in the middle the room Takes space away and not ok for me if Im not travelling alone Not really suitable for guests without a car Far from the metro Not next to metro station, Food at the restaurant was excellent Personnel was very friendly and professional Decoration of the restaurant lounge very nice
445188,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Quite far from the airport and not very easily accessible Breakfast was expensive for what it was there were a few pieces of bacon and 2 sausages left Maybe should be included in the price as 2 nights stay was quite pricey , Lovely clean room with a comfy bed Friendly and helpful staff 
445189,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel Facade is very depressing and it looks as if the Silo has been transformed into a room The showers are horrendous as there is cylinder glass shower which is in the center of the room If travelling with friends then certainly one has to move out if you mind peep show , Big round windows gives you a beautiful view of outside especially the lake highway side from higher floors There is ample parking if you are driving to Hotel and looking for something away from City Center IKEA is 10 minutes walk away Nice bar and descent restaurant 
445190,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Little far away from metro and train station Weird shower room not suitable for non couples , stylish and clean room kind staff shuttle bus to the metro station
445191,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Unfortunately for us this hotel was not great the customer service was very bad On arrival we were not given an information about internet shuttle bus breakfast Times place Ect The normal information you should receive on check in We went to our hotel room and walked into a room that had not been cleaned from a previous guest dirty towels bed not made went back to reception and no apology just an Opps They advertise a shuttle bus service every 30 mins there is no problem getting it down to the metro but you will only be able to get it from the metro back to your hotel if there are other guests coming down to the metro at the same time you want to return The walk to the metro is 20 minutes Nice quite walk along the river if the weather is nice if not you really rely on the shuttle Lovely modern hotel pity about the customer service , Lovely Modern unique hotel Hotel is a bit far out from the city but nice quite area with food places across the road KFC burgerkind Pizza pasta 
445192,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, I liked the funky decor but wasn t so crazy about the shower in the middle of the bedroom , The free shuttle to the train station was lovely and the staff were amazing 
445193,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Was left waiting on occasion for the shuttle service , Quirky hotel with excellent facilities as well as doing the simple things right Ideal for young couple visiting the city or business stop over
445194,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, We were on the 11th floor and the lift wouldn t stop on that floor as the button wouldn t press , Very friendly staff and very attentive too customer needs 
445195,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The shuttle was AWFUL They were supposed to come pick us up at pre scheduled time they didn t show up We waited And waited And ended up walking back to the hotel from the tram station a solid 30 45 minute walk on 4 of our 5 nights Sometimes with luggage or bags And when brought to their attention no apologies were given by the management or nothing was done to compensate for the dissatisfaction They did show up on time on the last night The staff was not overly friendly some were great at times though And this hotel is REALLY FAR from the city center Don t book here if you are wanting easy access to the livelihood of Amsterdam , It was a unique looking hotel they allowed us to stay a few stories up so there was a decent view I did feel safe and that my things were secure 
445196,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, When I entered into my room I discovered a very dirty towel hanging up on the artificial plant in the corner of the room As I had an appointment outside I went downstairs and informed the 1st receptionist When I came back just before 4 hours later I discovered again the dirty towel at the same place I went downstairs and obviously I complained a lot to a 2nd receptionist who came with me to remove the towel I have to admit that the 2nd receptionist was really professional and really annoyed by the situation , The 2nd receptionist who came with me to remove the dirty towel 
445197,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast selection needs to be slightly improved Location is the major disadvantage , Modern and clean rooms good quality toiletries comfy bed nice restaurant and skybar Free sparkling wine with breakfast Free complimentary shuttle to Holendrecht 
445198,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing to complain about, This hotel is the best hotel I have ever visited in Europe I travel around a lot and have made a lot of comparisons It has a friendly staff who speak multiple languages their rooms are clean they have the sexiest glass shower ever in the middle of the bedroom and they serve dinner which is reserved for a King Very lovely place Anyone who wants to be treated like Royalty should book a place at this fabulous place They offer a free shuttle service to Holendrecht tube Station as well making it convenient to get to town without stress Their rates are very moderate as well I was there on the 1st of April 2016 Jorn Nana Van Brobbey 
445199,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, The dinner menu pillows really suck selection of fox channels for sport advertised gym sauna and spa but were no longer available when we got there felt a bit ripped off , The Staff Charlotte very helpful and friendly The views shower bed was ok 
445200,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Rate 1 10 for beds 3 Don t remember seeing a single smiling person at ANY time restaurant closes at 9 room service very inappropriate I called for milk orange juice and maybe a bread to spread some butter basic stuff they said they could only find milk charged 15 euros ,No Positive
445201,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Location is some what out of the way for a city break Aprox 30 mins using transport to the centre, Whole hotel was very well presented cleaned and maintained Modern quirky feel
445202,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, the shuttle didn t come on time is upon request not every 30 min as mentioned on booking com the room AC wasn t working properly the double bed requested was 2 single no duty manager to talk to for night shift , they change the room with a proper one the left some gifts for us on the bed 
445203,Fletcher Hotel Amsterdam, Bar staff not very friendly in fact one individual was quite rude Waited ages to get served at bar when staff not busy Kept waiting told by one lady no ice and then 5 minutes ice appeared but did not offer any Then asked about where to sit told quite curtly wherever NOT IMPRESSED , The hotel very clean and food very good
