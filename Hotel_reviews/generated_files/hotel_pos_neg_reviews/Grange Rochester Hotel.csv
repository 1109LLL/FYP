232333,Grange Rochester Hotel, i would have preferred my expenses to be added on to my room bill i had to pay as i went along for wine ect , location and the staff were accommodating
232334,Grange Rochester Hotel, See above, The location was good Off main roads so quiet except our room looked out over another building and their windows One of them must have been someone s WC because they were often nude So we had to keep our curtains closed which made it quite warm in the room Also we had 3 twin beds in a very small room No place for luggage or to walk dress 
232335,Grange Rochester Hotel, Would be nice if they offered breakfast but at least there are tea coffee facilities in the room and no breakfast is preferable to a bad breakfast , Nice room layout Loved the spacious and pretty bathroom with bathtub 
232336,Grange Rochester Hotel, This was labeled a 4 Star hotel yet no A C only two outlets one of which was by the door so not useful no coffee maker no iron barely any walking room We had a triple room for myself my husband and 16 year old daughter we each got a tiny twin size bed one of which was a spring mattress cot Bathtub glass door rubber bottom broken so water leaked all over the floor Truly one of the worst hotels I have stayed Stayed at another 4 Star hotel in London few days prior with a complete opposite experience so I am comparing hotels within the same city , Nothing
232337,Grange Rochester Hotel, Hotels in London in general are overpriced, Hotel is very well located some restaurants are nearby which is convenient when you are arriving at midnight
232338,Grange Rochester Hotel, I chose this hotel for a special weekend away with my wife I had stayed at other Grange hotels on business and based on this positive experience I opted for the Grange Rochester I disliked my trip for three reasons We were staying in a poky top floor room with sloping ceilings I am 6 4 and it was claustrophobic to put it mildly We didn t wish to spend any more time than absolutely necessary in that room While the room was reasonably appointed it was shabby in parts and in need of a refurb as well as being cramped My second disappointment was during check in when the receptionist beamed at two other guests and told them the good news that they d been upgraded to a better room This only exacerbated my disappointment at our room especially on a special trip I appreciate that not everybody can have an upgrade but there must be a more discrete way of telling the lucky guests who do perhaps take them to one side etc Thirdly we arrived before our room was available for check in It was a very hot day and we opted to wait in the air conditioned bar and have a coffee It was impossible to find anybody to serve us and I had to go to reception three times before a waiter finally appeared ,No Positive
232339,Grange Rochester Hotel, There was no air conditioning During a heat wave in the summertime proved to be a tad uncomfortable , Comfy beds great bathroom nice large windows loved the lobby bar elevator everyone was nice 
232340,Grange Rochester Hotel, No air conditioning was very hot so could not sleep all night opened windows but noisy road Also no where to get snacks or cold drinks my grandson and I had to walk outside and find somewhere to get snacks and cold drinks , location was good within walking distance of Westminster and Victoria station
232341,Grange Rochester Hotel, Old Old Old Room needs a refurb The bed was low on slats and was one of those flip up to the wall type Creaked and felt like it could collapse at any time especially with duct tape all of the legs The shower was poor and a huge step up into the tub , Location was good and room looked out on to a lovely green square 
232342,Grange Rochester Hotel, Not aware of room size when booking was made Very small bathroom Shower in bath TV did not work even after switching on the plugs Not easy to make a cup of coffee, Proximity to tourist attractions
232343,Grange Rochester Hotel, No air conditioning on the hottest weekend of the year but appreciate the weather in the UK is rarely like that Disappointed at the fact that the wine bar closed really early when we would have eaten there every night because the food was so good We ve stayed here two years on the trot and would have stayed again the same time next year however I m disappointed that the price seems to have trebled for the same time next year so we won t be returning , Value for money location fabulous the food in the wine bar attached was fantastic 
232344,Grange Rochester Hotel, The cost of breakfast was extortionate even for London so we ended up at a coffee shop down the road I booked a twin executive room via booking com which advertised a balcony standard twin had same facilities except for a trouser press balcony Upon arriving at the hotel we entered our room to find we had been given a standard room and all executive twin rooms were fully booked the staff stated that executive was based on the size of the room not whether a balcony was included hence why I believe this is false advertising on booking com Staff ended up putting myself friend in a double room with balcony which we were happy with , Quiet location Nice view of the green Staff were very friendly After being provided with the incorrect room the staff we re accommodating resolved the issue 
232345,Grange Rochester Hotel, We were booked into a room with 2 double beds The room was small so our suitcases had to go on one of the beds The bed we slept on was very small for 2 people plus it was very hot Breakfast wasn t available until 8am and as we needed to leave by 8 to catch a bus we didn t have breakfast Also check in isn t until 3pm Very expensive , Handy location 
232346,Grange Rochester Hotel,No Negative, Loved the location and selection of restaurants abs shops close by Also easily accessible either on foot or local transport to all other tourist atractions
232347,Grange Rochester Hotel, Breakfast if added on was expensive, excellent value for money given its in Westminster The rooms overlooking the park were so quiet Quietest hotel I have ever had in London Clean and comfortable
232348,Grange Rochester Hotel, Food was expensive but that might just be London , The location was very convenient to seeing the top attractions in London Self con tained with food and bar 
232349,Grange Rochester Hotel, I couldn t reach the bath shower controls without stepping into the bath and as this might have meant my head getting soaked I didn t use the bath shower at all the glass panel was in the way of the controls badly designed , bed was comforable
232350,Grange Rochester Hotel, No tea coffee facilities in room I guess the downside of originally furnishing to a high quality is that s it s too expensive to replace too often as a result it looked a little tired in places , A good price for the location Quiet 10 mins walk from Victoria bus station 
232351,Grange Rochester Hotel, Room could have had an additional chair and more plug outlets next to beds , The roominess cleanliness and close location to Victoria train and tube stations were ideal 
232352,Grange Rochester Hotel,No Negative, Great classy hotel with pleasant warm welcoming staff Lovely location not far from the centre of london leading to the landmarks I was down in london dj ing at an event and the hotel fit perfectly to relax beforehand and after i returned Would highly recommend and definately considering coming again for future preference if im back in the london area 
232353,Grange Rochester Hotel, The only thing that let our room down was the view which looked out onto another building over a busy road although that didn t affect our stay as we were out most of the time We slept with the windows open as the weather was really warm and the traffic was noisy There were 2 electric fans provided in the room which we did use during the little time we spent in the room during the day , The hotel was in an ideal location only 10 minutes walk from the high street shops restaurants and both rail and tube stations at Victoria All of the hotel staff were helpful and nothing was a problem We asked to borrow an iron ironing board when we checked in and it was delivered as soon as we reached our room The hotel is full of old world charm and we would definitely stay here again 
232354,Grange Rochester Hotel, The only milk provided was whole milk and the breakfast tea provided and served was unpalatable , Close proximity to local sites Homely and comfortable 
232355,Grange Rochester Hotel, Had requested the room to be ready by 14 00 1 00 before normal allowed check in time Had to get changed for the Royal Garden Party at Buckingham Palace in a toilet My partner was very upset , Lovely view from the balcony over the cricket pitch 
232356,Grange Rochester Hotel, Terrible checking in Day 1 was given the wrong room ordered after complaining they couldn t do anything about it as the manager wasn t in Day 2 was told I was given the correct room to find out later that is was the wrong size bed Staff Cleaning ladies noisy outside and kept knocking on my door from 8 11 every morning evening with a DO NOT DISTURB outside door Could hear them making noises in the hallways and bashing with the hoover , It s on a quiet road 
232357,Grange Rochester Hotel, We didn t have breakfast as 25 per person seemed too dear , The location simply could not be any better and although the decor is a little tired the hotel was very clean and excellent value for money 
232358,Grange Rochester Hotel, The room we stayed in although spacious looked dated The bathroom tiles had chips and cracks and was in need of some TLC Some of the furniture the drawers were falling apart and we could have done with more than four coat hangers in the wardrobe Apart from that the bed was very comfortable and the room was clean and tidy , The hotel location is perfect and the bar lounge area s are really good and the staff friendly and attentive We were booked in on a room only basis however the food menu looked good 
232359,Grange Rochester Hotel, I am allergic to Kiwi fruit and asked for some fruit salad with out and the language barrier in breakfast room almost cost me a very painful episode except I could see seeds and didnt eat it Not good,No Positive
232360,Grange Rochester Hotel, Checkin staff made us feel very unwelcome Our first time in london We booked this accom in January and we were given a room below street level As if we were a last minute booking Very frustrating as we have made dozens of bookings thru this website No view except for a concrete wall couldn t open windows as room not secure Room very musty smelt like dirty socks Bar fridge locked Will never stay with this chain again And probably won t stay in London again due to this experience , Reasonable Walking distance to buckingham palace and Westminster abbey
232361,Grange Rochester Hotel, Wish the bar tender in the gentlemen s lounge knew how to actually make a variety of drinks Maybe take a course The furniture was quite outdated especially in lobby Maybe upgrade these , This was a nice hotel Staff were very accommodating especially Phillipe our concierge Housekeeping great room service great And the quiet location meant getting good sleep Close to everything you need 
232362,Grange Rochester Hotel, No end table on my side of the bed due to the size of the room , Good location Bed was comfortable Clean Nicely decorated cute hotel Helpful and courteous staff 
232363,Grange Rochester Hotel, Typically for Central London the hotel breakfast is outrageously expensive Several great alternatives in the neighbourhood try The Regency Cafe at 6 50 instead of 24 Single room tiny and very expensive No air conditioning , Location very convenient for Victoria Gatwick Express Also excellent neighbourhood for eating out Nice helpful staff 
232364,Grange Rochester Hotel, The mattress was a bit firm for my liking but I slept fine , I had a lower ground floor room facing the road not generally my favourite location in a hotel but this one was nice and quiet 
232365,Grange Rochester Hotel, Breakfast would have been an extra 18 for continental and 26 for English TV on standby had a very bright flashing blue light Problem solved with strategically placed cushion , En suite had a bath with soap shampoo Room was spacious TV and wi fi worked well Bed was comfortable with enough cushions of various sizes to build a small fort Good choice of teas and coffees 
232366,Grange Rochester Hotel, Our room was in the basement which made it quiet which is a good thing However the room was very small and instead of a proper double bed we had a pull down bed one of those you see in movies in tiny apartments that fold away into a wall cupboard It was like camping out at a friend s house on their emergency guest bed The room was old and tired They tried to dress it up nicely in a classic style but who cares I rather have a proper bed The bathroom was even smaller We asked them to show us a different room which was bigger indeed but even worse it was very tired smelly and dirty with stains on the walls The hotel gives this luxury impression on their website but don t be fooled Just because it is old doesn t make it stylish or charming Ok it is London and everything is expensive but anywhere else in the world this would rate as a 1 star experience , The location is excellent
232367,Grange Rochester Hotel,No Negative, Just a very good experience Warm welcome with polite attentive staff With comfortable stylish rooms and a lovely ambience throughout That s it 
232368,Grange Rochester Hotel, The hotel room was tired Bathroom tiles could have been cleaner We had little milk so had to ring reception for some phonedphon, The location was excellent for the places we wanted to visit
232369,Grange Rochester Hotel, Nothing really I d be nitpicking , Just overall a great small hotel good location reasonable No parking but I didn t need it it s central London 
232370,Grange Rochester Hotel, Breakfast was ok but not great The selection is between English breakfast beans sausages tomato etc or continental breakfast English breakfast looked good continental breakfast could be improved it should offer more pastries and fruit in my opinion , The location of this hotel is great Nice area and at a walking distance to Westminster and the Big Ben The building has its charme both inside and outside The room I was given was small but it had everything I needed including free wi fi and it was very clean and quiet The hotel staff is super friendly and pleasant The ratio quality price is great I recommend this hotel and I will definitely come back 
232371,Grange Rochester Hotel, Lounge bar area not within hotel Breakfast not included Room too small En suite very small and dated Room too dark with no view Price rather high at 137 50 for back room and no breakfast , Very comfortable beds Decor very dated Room small and rather dark Staff very friendly and helpful 
232372,Grange Rochester Hotel, Breakfast was awful Small and very expensive They also charge same price on wkd for only continental breakfast breakfast Almost 20 pounds We are nearby and got a better and bigger breakfast for 2 at same price they charged for one , Location and view 
232373,Grange Rochester Hotel, The room was a bit outdated looking but it definitely had a pleasant old fashioned flair to it , The hotel room was clean spacious and had a balcony Grange Rochester was conveniently located no more than a 10 minute walk to Westminister Abby and Parliment in a quiet neighborhood near a wonderful park The hotel staff was friendly and helpful 
232374,Grange Rochester Hotel,No Negative, Everything from start to finish was great The staff was really nice and our room was clean and cozy with an amazing view from the balcony Would recommend this hotel without a doubt and hope to stay there again 
232375,Grange Rochester Hotel, the fold down bed was too low no balcony even it stated there was one Breakfast cost go around the corner and pay half the price, the location for Tate Britain
232376,Grange Rochester Hotel, The price of the breakfast was outrageous especially in view of several establishments close by where you could buy a full English Breakfast with coffee for under 5 Pounds Best place for breakfast is Cafe Nuvo about a 6 minute walk and is highly used by locals including the policemen which is always a good recommendation It s quite a walk and certainly not a straight shot to either Victoria Station or St James It took us awhile to figure out how to get to the Tube and back to the hotel , The hotel was very nice with an inviting atmosphere and a very friendly and helpful staff The lift worked great Our room had a nice view of the Vincent Park The hotel is located in a quiet section of Westminster It was clean and comfortable Nice little sitting area A great place for a visit in London 
232377,Grange Rochester Hotel, To get a glass of the House Rose wine I had to use the bar on the corner of the hotel It would have been nice to have a bowl of fruit to select as well as chopped fruit at breakfast , The intimate and friendly welcome was perfect The rooms were spacious and very comfortable Lots of clean towels and bathroom products were available Tea and coffee making facilities in the room 
232378,Grange Rochester Hotel, The breakfast was 24 per person per day so we ate elsewhere The barman wasn t a barman and choice was limited The bathroom was very small had to close the door to get to the sink, The room was very big and the bed was very comfy
232379,Grange Rochester Hotel, Room extremely small for the price i paid which didnt include breakfast The bathroom floor did not appear wiped there were stains on the net curtains and the ceiling so not impressed with that for the price i was paying , Location was close to where the event I was attending that weekend
232380,Grange Rochester Hotel, Lack of buses to Victoria but it takes only few minutes of walk to go to Quite high temperature in the room and I would have preferred a bigger bathroom , Room size bed comfort lovely furniture and excellent position Two underground stops and you ll be in Piccadilly Circus Staff are so kind and the luggage can be left in their storage Absolutely Recommended 
232381,Grange Rochester Hotel, The tea and coffee facilities and no fridge are n the room The decor of the rooms is rather tired, Comfortable room and quiet location Professional and friendly staff
232382,Grange Rochester Hotel, The light switches in our room a bit confusing , The location is great tranquil spot just off the hustle and bustle you expect in central London I managed to leave a valuable item behind and the staff were first class in responding and returning it to me 
232383,Grange Rochester Hotel, The free Wifi is very slow and not stable For business use it is not suitable The room I had was very small and did not have airco The breakfast is OK ish The breakfast room is small and one might have to wait a while , The building has atmosphere and is relatively quiet It lies close to a small park It is in walking distance of Victoria Station
232384,Grange Rochester Hotel, Breakfast was overpriced especially on Sunday when there was no egg options, Beds were comfortable Liked having WIFI access in room Cable TV was also very nice Staff was very helpful
232385,Grange Rochester Hotel, They have kept and maintained the grandeur of the place so some may consider it old or dirty but I give them credit for not gutting the place and removing the character of the hotel People who expect renovated sterile properties will not appreciate this hotel Carpeting bedding draperies and towels were all new and top quality It is in a quiet residential neighborhood so the streets get quiet at night It felt perfectly safe but it was quiet late at night I was surprised by how expensive it was but compared to other hotels it was a value and my choices were limited because we had 3 adults Maybe I just waited too long and didn t get the good room rates , We had 3 people in our party so it was tricky trying to find a room that accommodated 3 adults My tall adult son was thrilled with his own double bed and we had a large queen All the beds left little floor space but we spent very little time in the room Location was great it is a hearty walk to Big Ben or Buckingham Palace but a 5 minute walk to the underground that will take you anywhere you want to go 
232386,Grange Rochester Hotel, The room was so hot We opened all the windows and had the fans going and it was still stifling We didn t sleep very well because of the heat , Very nice staff and a great location The room was spacious and quiet 
232387,Grange Rochester Hotel, Food in the wine bar was served cold inside also my hot chocolate though both replaced without question , The room was spacious and had some style plus a bath in the marble tiled en suite The lounge bar was comfy 
232388,Grange Rochester Hotel, I didn t like the staff that was cleaning the room I was standing in my room just in my underwere and a men from the cleaning room just opened the door with his card Also I left some food on the window and went for a walk When I came back it was missing But the most sad event happend when we left I forget my pijama under the pilow I called the same day at the hotel they double looked and said that who was cleaning the room didn t find anything I am 100 convince that I left it under the pilow Such a great hotel sould be more carefull with the cleaning staff they have For sure you will find who was gilty in this case because such cases will probably repeat This is the reputation of the hotel and they should be more carefull with their cleaning staff , The girls from reception Maria and Dumitrita were very nice They answer every question we had And the gentelmen that was theire manager was very nice The room was lovely 
232389,Grange Rochester Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful staff Great location within walking distance to Victoria station and Westminster Houses of Parliament Price very reasonable for a London Hotel 
232390,Grange Rochester Hotel, Lift stopped one floor below then had to walk up two flights of stairs Staff always carried heavy case The bath was higher than I have normally experienced therefore difficult to enter for shower The bed was harder than I prefer Not as spacious as I would expect from a four star Breakfast seriously overpriced in my experience and opinion Would have liked but not prepared to pay the price , Staff were five star quality being very courteous helpful and professional 
232391,Grange Rochester Hotel, The minibar was locked and I had some items I needed to keep in the fridge The bath tap was dripping all night and was a bit annoying, The room was comfortable and clean and check in check out was all done on ipad and was quick and easy
232392,Grange Rochester Hotel, Room was very small there was no safe in the room Bedside drawer contained items left by the previous occupant One pack of biscuits rather than a pack each left with the tea coffee a bit mean , Location of hotel nice and quiet but close to restaurants and sights Bed was really comfy Was able to open windows to let air in 
232393,Grange Rochester Hotel, Not a bad thing to say, The staff were very friendly helpfull and professional the lady who checked us in and out was a delight The room was small but perfect for just us two people the shower was amazing
232394,Grange Rochester Hotel, All said opposite under wrong heading bet your computer will be confused , Breakfast very ordinary cold and very expensive I thought your quote included breakfast No difference in price of cooked v continental Bad experience
232395,Grange Rochester Hotel, Very small room it was not comfy we couldn t stand next to each other between the door and the bed Rooms should be a little bigger Missing minibar Very expensive English Breakfast 24 GBP person Electric door key was went wrong twice during our stay , Good bar good location nice crew 
232396,Grange Rochester Hotel, There is nothing to be called sound proof so it was thanks to other guests that they happened to be thoughtful and keep quiet in corridors Otherwise a good night sleep would have been much more difficult to get A quiet room was requested but we found ourselves with windows to main street side Fortunately there were no night time fuss outside , Tidy room Peaceful neighbourhood without night time fuss 
232397,Grange Rochester Hotel, The hotel room looks a bit old and not the cleanest that I ve seen But overall it s still worth the money we paid , The hotel is very classy and the staff were really friendly 
232398,Grange Rochester Hotel,No Negative, Clean tidy room spacious for 3 of us bed very comfy room not to hot staff lovely and friendly Saw a few negative reviews and i just dont see how anyone can complain about this hotel was perfect for our short stay and really enjoyed it So close to all everything and just value for money all around 
232399,Grange Rochester Hotel, They don t know how to manage their business properly and should pay attention to customers special requests and should at least have the courteousy of letting the customer know when such requests can t be met ,No Positive
232400,Grange Rochester Hotel, Rooms are a little small but welcome to a European hotel , The staff were very helpful and went out of their way for me The hotel is ideally located near Westminster and a number of good restaurants 
232401,Grange Rochester Hotel, location pretty far from nearest station Carpet was damp in front of bathroom and next to bed socks got wet Kind of small thing but something you don t expect to witness in a 4 star hotel furniture was a bit worn out, nice tiny hotel Neat room comfy beds lovely staff 
232402,Grange Rochester Hotel, We were placed in basement floor and that was the opposite of what Ive asked for Toilet area not really cleaned everything else just about ok , Close to Victoria area felt safe 
232403,Grange Rochester Hotel, Check in was time consuming The three of us had to provide e mail addresses and signatures The room didn t have all the items for 3 people even though it was a 3 bedded room The hotel was quite noisy at night , Good location comfortable warm room 
232404,Grange Rochester Hotel, Some reviews mention a small room My room was a single room and was well sized You are right in Victoria London so the room size is appropriate , Could not recommend this hotel higher Wonderful service beautiful room I had a personal issue with family illness meaning I had to modify my booking and although it was non adjustable the hotel were very very helpful and adjusted it for me with no problems Room was perfect having the windows able to be open was a nice touch Loved the marble bathroom Every single member of staff was friendly and polite going out of their way to be helpful I would definitely stay here again 
232405,Grange Rochester Hotel, No plug socket near the bed as far as we could see Window ledge was dirty when you open the window Toilet is quiet cramped with a possibilty of stubbing your toe on the door jam Key card kept playing up not working which ended up with a member of staff coming to the top floor for the key working first time Not worth 99 even with the upgrade to exectutive but the extra double bed was very useful , Convienient location The bed was really comfortable Fell asleep in seconds The room was really warm on arrival which was very convienient flying from a country thats 18 c The staff were really friendly and helpful even had one member who could relate to us living in spain because she is spanish which was really nice 
232406,Grange Rochester Hotel, Avoid room G5 basement terrible bed and battered mattress I fail to understand how a hotel would not invest in good quality beds being its prime purpose of existence Breakfast very expensive GBP18 24 but the area offers plenty of alternatives below 10 GBP Room service a bit haphazard one day no new tea bags another no shampoo bottles etc , Quiet area short walk to Westminster St James Park and tube station and Victoria Station Friendly staff and very clean 
232407,Grange Rochester Hotel, We had the executive twin room myself and a teenage niece The beds are very small and uncomfortable We had to move them quite a bit apart to be able to sleep The pillows are subpar as well Bathroom was small and constantly wet after showers due to a quarter plastic door with a poor seal Although we were checked in early to our room yay we got a room right near the bar which made all night noise a problem sometimes , The staff were friendly patient and responsive The location is great and close to many attractions The Victoria train station is easy to find Decent restaurants for eating close by Staff were able to check us in a bit early which was very nice after a long flight from NY 
232408,Grange Rochester Hotel, Breakfast spread could have been better , Bed was comfortable The entire hotel was clean They switched our rooms without any additional fees Centrally located to all the main sites Quiet property even over weekends even though it s in the middle of town We loved it 
232409,Grange Rochester Hotel, Rooms small but that s to be expected in London and breakfast at 18 a head is 5 too expensive, Location location and a nice bar to relax in after hectic shopping
232410,Grange Rochester Hotel, Breakfast was too expensive so I ate elsewhere Bathroom could have been updated a little , Character balcony overlooking cricket pitch comfy bed dark curtains
232411,Grange Rochester Hotel, We were advised at check in to create an open account so we could charge drinks extras to the room This was a total waste of time as when we went the bar they wouldn t accept the open account we still had to pay cash We should have just paid for the room at check in and it would have saved us waiting in the long queue to pay at checkout , A lovely hotel with a cosy welcoming atmosphere The room was nicely decorated with good facilities
232412,Grange Rochester Hotel, Four star rating is over the top having stayed in 2 other hotels within the Grange Range which were far better and deserved the 5 star rating the Rochester falls way below the mark , Close to where I needed to be 
232413,Grange Rochester Hotel, Our room overlooked the main road and was rather noisy on Saturday night However it was much better on Sunday and we slept well that night , The staff were really friendly and helpful 
232414,Grange Rochester Hotel, The bathroom has seen better days and the shower head was ineffectual The breakfast was far too expensive 24 00 each for a cooked breakfast Needless to say we went round the corner and had a lovely one for 5 00 , The beds were very comfy plenty of tea and coffee in the room quiet location and heating made sure we were never cold 
232415,Grange Rochester Hotel, Nothing , I highly recommend you to stay in this hotel Good location good hospitality I have to pay to use a computer and print out my boarding pass but I could use for free with their permission Also staffs are kind and considerate Obviously you can be a loyal customer 
232416,Grange Rochester Hotel, Room was very small Suitable for two but bordered on uncomfortable Beds were horribly firm Did not make for a peaceful rest at all , Within walking distance of Victoria Station where you can access the Underground and the Gatwick express to the airport Also near plenty of shops and a variety of restaurants Very close to sightseeing Room was cozy but comfortable Staff was friendly Great value for the price 
232417,Grange Rochester Hotel, Could have been more plug sockets in hotel room No thermostat in room and windows not easy to open it was too hot but not unbearable as we had double doors to open onto balcony, Tea and coffee in room kettle and hair dryer Also in bathroom are sanitary bags and toiletries 
232418,Grange Rochester Hotel, The room furnishings are getting quite shabby and are not the cleanest Not a thing has changed in 8 years and much dust has accumulated in nooks and crannies , Location is outstanding Staff knowledgable and warm 
232419,Grange Rochester Hotel, Waited 30 minutes for a cooked English breakfast then to be told that the chef did not know how to do one so went with out one very pricey breakfast , Clean Comfortable
232420,Grange Rochester Hotel, The breakfasts are quite expensive We didn t have any meals there , The location is good being an easy walk to Stt James s Park Westminster Abbey and Trafalgar Square It is very quiet in the area which e like 
232421,Grange Rochester Hotel, Safe door in wardrobe needed to be made secure as it swung open as the wardrobe door was opened Would have liked to have been informed of the price of breakfast before we entered the restraunt , Good but not EXTRA flaky
232422,Grange Rochester Hotel, Totally inefficient check in accounting Room claustrophobic shower dangerous Lot of trainees Sister Wellington just around corner so much better , Not much at all 
232423,Grange Rochester Hotel, Breakfast is way to expensive Go around the corner and spend 8 pounds for a full breakfast vs almost 30 pounds at the hotel That s crazy , Quiet but very central
232424,Grange Rochester Hotel, It was really hot and the fan didn t work properly and there was only one outlet in the room so I couldn t have the fan if I needed to plug anything else in like charge my phone , Excellent location friendly staff
232425,Grange Rochester Hotel, Only bad things our room was SO hot there were fans but really needs air con Also the front desk techy log on method actually just made checking in slower , Really good location lovely looking and staff were very attentive
232426,Grange Rochester Hotel, Not really that switched on when it comes to thinking of the basics that gives guests a good customer experience stopping the only lift essential in this tiny hotel at 10am to clean it when guests are checking out one old couple stranded with their luggage on 4th floor Room service impossible if you haven t opened an account with them me can t you take my card details over the phone them no due to security reasons me on an internal phone call Come on GR this is a 4star hotel in the 21st century room service should be a doddle Since I was going to walk out in the rain to the ATM then obviously I spent that money on a meal elsewhere The hotel has nice decor but the room was quite shabby so it was very expensive for what it was , reasonably well located quiet but not too far to walk anywhere Staff were very nice on check in 
232427,Grange Rochester Hotel, The room was far too hot with no way to cool it down A fan did not reduce the temperature enough nor did opening the window Sweating all night was not pleasant , Good location and quiet 
232428,Grange Rochester Hotel, Unfortunately for a 4 hotel I would expect to have an AC in the room Thanks God I had two fans in the closet the winsows were not blocked AND I stayed NOT during heat wave , Very nice quiet location near Victoria next to the Vincent Park Knowledgeable and nice staff There was a little problem with my TV late at night and the management agreed with no problem to provide breakfast free of charge for this inconvenience Also it was very nice that even that I didn t ask I ve got a free upgrade I booked a one single bed room and got a spacious 2 double beds room with a bathtub It was a treat 
232429,Grange Rochester Hotel, Very disappointed No slippers 4 stars hotel no refrigerator no air conditioning no bath sponge dirt in the toilet the bed called King Size doesn t look one for 2 is really small , Location was good Staff was welcoming 
232430,Grange Rochester Hotel,No Negative, Charming and great location Our first trip to London so we didn t know what to expect Many quaint restaurants near easy walk to Victoria Station Dinner was exceptionally good Staff couldn t have been more helpful 
232431,Grange Rochester Hotel, Old hotel no AC if you need wash your hand you need let water run for several minutes to get cold water otherwise the water from faucet is blazing hot , Good location
